The SDB I weapon system consists \n     of the weapons, the BRU-6l/A (4-place pneumatic carriage \n     system), shipping and handling containers for a single weapon \n     and the BRU-61/A either empty or loaded, and weapon planning \n     module. It has integrated diamond-back type wings that deploy \n     after release, which increases the glide time and therefore \n     maximum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global Positioning System \n     aided Inertial Navigation System (AJGPS/INS) provides \n     guidance to the coordinates of a stationary target. The \n     payload/warhead is a very effective multipurpose penetrating \n     and blast fragmentation warhead couples with a cockpit \n     selectable-electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy allow for a \n     effective munition with less collateral damage. A proximity \n     sensor provides height of burst capability.\n       2.

Mr. President, the last time the Senate convened we \nhad just reclaimed the Capitol from violent criminals who tried to stop \nCongress from doing our duty.\n  The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the President and other \npowerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a \nspecific proceeding of the first branch of the Federal Government which \nthey did not like.\n  But we pressed on. We stood together and said an angry mob would not \nget veto power over the rule of law in our Nation, not even for one \nnight.\n  We certified the people's choice for their 46th President.\n  Tomorrow, President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris will \nbe sworn in. We will have a safe and successful inaugural right here on \nthe west front of the Capitol--the space that President Bush 41 called \n``democracy's front porch.''\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  And then we will move forward. Our work for the American people will \ncontinue, as it has for more than 230 years. There are serious \nchallenges that our Nation needs to continue confronting, but there \nwill also be great and hopeful opportunities for us to seize.\n  Certainly, November's elections did not hand any side a mandate for \nsweeping ideological change. Americans elected a closely divided \nSenate, a closely divided House, and a Presidential candidate who said \nhe would represent everyone.\n  So our marching orders from the American people are clear. We are to \nhave a robust discussion and seek common ground. We are to pursue \nbipartisan agreement everywhere we can and check and balance one \nanother respectfully where we must. And through all of this, we must \nalways keep in mind that we are all Americans, we all love this \ncountry, and we are all in this together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Now, Mr. President, on a related matter, a great deal \nhas already been said about the disgraceful events of January 6. More \nwill be said in the weeks ahead.\n  I understand the FBI has already made at least 100 arrests, and the \nJustice Department reports more than 275 persons under investigation--a \nnumber that is climbing fast. I want to commend the work of the \nDepartment to swiftly investigate and bring offenders to justice.\n  As I have stated, January 6 saw failures of institutions, protocols, \nand planning. Those failures did not just leave Congress itself \nexposed; they also left the courageous men and women of the Capitol \nPolice themselves in a totally untenable situation.\n  So today, I want to reaffirm the huge respect and gratitude that I \nhave--and I believe all Senators have--for the men and women of the \nU.S. Capitol Police who put their own safety on the line every single \nday that they clock in and stand guard.\n  Neither the institution of Congress nor the American people will ever \nforget the bravery and the valor of Officer Brian Sicknick, who \nsacrificed himself to protect this place and those inside it.\n  We will not forget our friend Officer Howard Liebengood.\n  And we will never forget our debt to all the brave CP officers and \ntheir families.\n  It is more than just comforting to come to work in a place protected \nby such fine men and women, at risk to themselves. It is also very \nhumbling.\n  We are also grateful to the local officers from DC, Virginia, and \nMaryland, to Federal law enforcement officers, the National Guard, the \nSecret Service, and all the other professionals who helped subdue the \ncriminals and secure the Capitol on the 6th and are working together to \nprotect peace and order this week.\n  Tomorrow, a new President and Vice President will swear their oaths \nof office. They will also do so safely and securely because so many \nbrave men and women have sworn their own oaths to support and defend \nour Constitution.\n  We salute you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, the Senate returns to session today for \nwhat will be a very busy and consequential period. Tomorrow, we will \ncelebrate one of democracy's core attributes: the peaceful transfer of \npower, albeit under much different circumstances than most Americans \nare used to.\n  Rioters, insurrectionists, White supremacists, and domestic \nterrorists tried to prevent the transfer of power. They were incited by \nnone other than the President of the United States. They have failed. \nThough they have made the transition of power anything but peaceful, \ndemocracy's oldest and most revered tradition, the peaceful passing of \nthe torch, will take place tomorrow.\n  We must remain vigilant. We must remain strong. If we do, democracy \nwill always prevail. Despite what these evil terrorists tried to do, \nthe peaceful passing of the torch will take place tomorrow as it has \nfor generations.\n  In the weeks since the attack, the Nation has learned about the \nheroism displayed by many Capitol Police officers on January 6. I want \nto again thank those officers who protected Members and staff. Let us \nalso recognize the bravery of one officer in particular, Brian \nSicknick, who was killed in the line of duty.\n  I also want to acknowledge those members of the fourth estate for \ntheir efforts during these difficult times, for continuing to shine a \nlight on what is happening at the Capitol, sometimes at great personal \nrisk.\n  Now, in the wake of the despicable assault on the U.S. Capitol on \nJanuary 6, we have taken precautions to ensure the safety of the \nInauguration of President-Elect Biden tomorrow. Senate leadership has \nbeen in close and constant communication with the Secret Service, the \nFBI, the National Guard, and the D.C. police. As we speak, there are \nmore troops around the Capitol than there are in Afghanistan. No \nforce--no force--will prevent tomorrow's constitutional proceedings \nfrom taking place.\n  Tomorrow, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be administered the oath \nof office. They will be sworn into the Presidency and Vice Presidency \nof the United States, and the powers vested in our Chief Executive will \nflow to a new office holder, a peaceful passing of the torch, as it has \nbeen for over two centuries in the grand tradition of democracy in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Tomorrow, the country will turn the page on the most chaotic and \ndivisive Presidency that can ever be remembered. We will begin again \nthe hard work of unifying and healing this Nation, defeating the \npandemic, recovering our economy, and repairing our standing and \nstature in the world--and this is just the beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, the Inauguration of a new President and \nthe start of a new administration always brings a flurry of activity to \nour Nation's government, but rarely-- rarely--has so much piled up for \nthe Senate as during this particular transition. Over the next several \nweeks, the Senate must accomplish three essential items: a second \nimpeachment trial of Donald Trump; the confirmation of President \nBiden's Cabinet and other key officials; and legislation to provide \nmuch needed--almost desperately needed--COVID relief.\n  Again, there are three essential items of business. No. 1, as \nmandated\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\nby law and Constitution, once the House of Representatives delivers \nArticles of Impeachment to the Senate, we will conduct and complete a \ntrial of Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection against these United \nStates.\n  No. 2, the Senate will confirm key members of soon-to-be President \nBiden's Cabinet. Those Cabinet officials in charge of national security \nmust be confirmed quickly, as well as those in charge of responding to \nthe current health and economic crisis.\n  No. 3, the Senate will take up legislation to provide the country \nadditional relief from the pandemic.\n  On impeachment, the Senate has solemn responsibility to try and hold \nDonald Trump accountable for the most serious charge ever levied \nagainst a President: the incitement of an insurrection against the \nUnited States of America.\n  The events on January 6, make no mistake about it, were not a \nspontaneous demonstration. President Trump invented the lie that \nmotivated these criminals. He exhorted them to come to Washington. He \nthen directed them at the U.S. Capitol, and his demagoguery whipped \nthem into a frenzy.\n  We need to set a precedent that the severest threat ever committed by \na President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the U.S. \nConstitution: impeachment and conviction by this Chamber, as well as \ndisbarment from future office.\n  In 230 years, the House of Representatives has impeached the \nPresident of the United States only twice. In just the past 13 months, \nit has impeached President Trump twice more. President Trump is a \nthreat to our constitutional order whether he is in or out of office. \nEven now, he has not accepted responsibility for what he has done and \nstill falsely maintains that the election was stolen.\n  Once he leaves office, do we really expect him to change his tune and \naccept the truth? Of course not. He will continue spreading lies about \nthe election and stoking the grievances of his most radical supporters, \nusing the prospect of a future Presidential run to poison the public \narena at a time when we must get so much done. After what he has done, \nthe consequences of which we were all witness to, Donald Trump should \nnot be eligible to run for office ever again.\n  All of us want to put this awful chapter in our Nation's history \nbehind us, but healing and unity will only come if there is truth and \naccountability, not sweeping such a severe charge, such awful actions, \nunder the rug.\n  So let me be clear. There will be an impeachment trial in the U.S. \nSenate. There will be a vote on convicting the President of high crimes \nand misdemeanors. And, if the President is convicted, there will be a \nvote on barring him from running again.\n  Now, the Cabinet. As I mentioned, the Senate must also fulfill its \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent on soon-to-be President \nBiden's executive and judicial nominations, particularly his Cabinet. \nToday, there are no fewer than five Senate hearings on Cabinet-level \nofficials for good reason. The violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol \non January 6 showed us we need qualified Senate-confirmed people in key \nnational security positions on day one. That means tomorrow.\n  The Senate will be in session tomorrow after the conclusion of the \nInauguration of the 46th President of the United States. With \ncooperation, we can confirm key national security nominees at State, \nthe Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Treasury, and the \nintelligence community. The health and economic challenges our Nation \nfaces and the need to get vaccines out quickly also require having key \nhealth officials and key economic nominees confirmed and on the job as \nsoon as possible.\n  In 2017, the Senate confirmed President Trump's Secretary of Defense \nand his Secretary of Homeland Security on Inauguration Day. President \nBiden should have the same officials in place on his Inauguration Day \nat the very least. That is the expectation and tradition for any \nadministration, but especially now in the midst of a Homeland Security \ncrisis.\n  As I said, the way the Senate works, it will take cooperation from \nour Republican colleagues to swiftly confirm these highly qualified \nnational security officials. But make no mistake, the Senate will move \nquickly to consider and confirm President Biden's cabinet.\n  Finally, on COVID and the legislation that is needed, once the Senate \nhas confirmed key nominations for the incoming administration, it will \nturn to the subject of additional COVID relief items, including key \nitems such as an increase in direct payments to American families; \nstrong, further support of vaccine distribution which must be improved; \nhelp for small businesses, schools, and State and local governments. \nVery soon, the country will pass another tragic milestone: 400,000 \nAmerican deaths from COVID-19. There is no issue more urgent then \ndefeating this pandemic, and the Senate will immediately set to work on \nthat goal as the first order of legislative business.\n  There will be much more work for us to do in the following months. \nWorking with President Biden and our House colleagues, the Senate will \nfinally address the major challenges facing our country that have for \ntoo long been ignored. We will consider bold legislation to defeat the \nclimate crisis by investing in clean infrastructure and manufacturing, \nwhich will create millions of good jobs for Americans, regardless of \nZIP Code. We must move significantly to improve our healthcare and \nchildcare systems. To fix and restore our income and equality problem, \nwe will fight to restore workers' rights and fairness in the Tax Code.\n  Today, we announce the first bill, S. 1, which will be a package of \nlong overdue reforms to protect our democracy after it has been so \nattacked in 4 years and will guarantee every American's right to vote.\n  One issue that has been long important to me is immigration reform. I \nalways felt that comprehensive immigration reform with a path to \ncitizenship is one of the most important things a Democratic Congress \ncan do. To me, passing comprehensive reform is a very high priority, so \nI was pleased that President-Elect Biden has crafted a proposal and \nwill call on Congress to take up this important subject. I am studying \nthe President-elect's proposal, and I look forward to working together \nwith him and the new administration and with my colleagues in Congress \nto get comprehensive immigration reform signed into law.\n  As I said at the beginning of this talk, the next several months will \nbe very, very busy and a very consequential period for the U.S. Senate. \nLet us begin our work in earnest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, it has been the honor of my lifetime to \nserve Georgia in the U.S. Senate. There has never been a day that I \ndon't walk through the hallways of the Capitol when I am not awestruck \nby the magnitude of this job and of this place and of my duty.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, especially those who welcomed me from \nthe start, who worked with me, and who even across the aisle worked \nwith me to get things done for our country in such a consequential \nyear.\n  I want to thank the people of Georgia who showed me the very best of \nour great State. My goal as Senator was clear: to work every single day \nto make Georgians' lives better and to make ours the very best State to \nwork, to live, to worship, and to raise a family.\n  I never stopped working to meet that goal and was energized and \nhumbled every single day by the opportunity to serve. In between weeks \nspent in Washington, I crisscrossed our great State nonstop, going from \nsoutheast coastal Georgia in Camden County to northwest mountain \nGeorgia in Catoosa County. Time with Georgians are my fondest memories.\n  One of my earliest visits was in Homerville, GA, population 2,400. I \ncarried the people of Homerville with me every day as I approached my \nwork. Having grown up on our family farm, where the nearest small town \nhad a population of 600, my calling to public service was, in large \npart, to be a voice--an outsized voice--for those who feel they didn't \nhave a voice in Washington.\n  Many Georgians inspired me each day to bring results to every corner \nof\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nour State. In that spirit, I want to thank Governor Kemp for appointing \nme and entrusting me with the important work of being a voice for our \nState and a servant to our citizens.\n  I was proud to serve alongside my friend and colleague Senator David \nPerdue.\n  I want to recognize Senator Johnny Isakson and Senator Saxby \nChambliss for their shining example of what it meant to be a Senator, \nand, most importantly, a public servant. I also want to recognize and \nthank my incredible husband, Jeff, whose love and support encouraged me \nevery single day. And I want to thank my family for instilling the \nvalues of faith, family, and hard work. You all have my deepest love \nand gratitude.\n  As importantly, I want to recognize my very talented and hard-working \nstaff, many of whom are with me today. Together, our work here and in \nGeorgia has made a tremendous difference in our State.\n  Let me tell you about just some of that work, because in one \nsignificant year in the Senate, I am so proud of all we have \naccomplished together. We delivered more than $47 billion in relief to \nGeorgia during the pandemic--to farmers, to family, to small \nbusinesses, hospitals, and schools. And, as a freshman Senator, I \nintroduced and passed six pieces of legislation. We secured funding for \nrural hospitals. We increased telehealth access, and we sped the \ndelivery of PPE to the frontlines.\n  I championed and we passed legislation that increased funding to help \nhomeless veterans get back on their feet, and I was proud to champion \nagriculture, our State's leading industry, as well as our military, law \nenforcement, small businesses, and school choice.\n  I stood up for innocent life, the Second Amendment, and all of our \nconstitutional rights.\n  I was able to use my business experience to develop four wide-ranging \nplans to drive economic security, keep our Nation safe, modernize our \nhealthcare system, and increase opportunities in minority communities.\n  In 2020 alone, our office helped over 5,200 Georgians with casework, \nincluding nearly 1,000 Georgia veterans and Active-Duty service men and \nwomen navigate their VA benefits in VA medical centers.\n  I am incredibly proud of all the work we accomplished together for \nour State and for our country. There is much more work to do. I had \nhoped to pass a piece of my legislation to bring back to the United \nStates from China the manufacturing of our critical medical supplies, \nincluding prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicine, and medical \nequipment.\n  I want to wish my successor well in his work serving Georgia.\n  Now, most farewell speeches urge colleagues to put country before \nparty or to fix what is broken here in the Senate. My message is \nslightly different. In all of the events of recent weeks, I want to \nurge my colleagues to remember why we are here, whom you serve, and to \nrecall the greatness of the American experiment, as well as the fragile \nnature of our freedoms.\n  I spent 30 years in the private sector chasing the American dream. I \nworked on our family's farm. I waitressed. I lived paycheck to \npaycheck. I moved around the country and worked hard to overcome \nsetbacks and to build a respected career in business. I came to Georgia \ntwo decades ago as a job seeker, and I became a job creator, helping to \ngrow a small startup company into a Fortune 500 company.\n  And, like many Georgians, part of that work is giving back in our \ncommunities and supporting others in achieving their dreams. I have \ndone that now in business, in philanthropy, in sports, and now in \npublic service. That is the American dream. It gives everyone, \nregardless of their background, the freedom to make the most of their \nlife, chase their passions, build their family and their career, and \nthrive in the greatest country in the world. Protecting that dream for \nall Americans should be our common cause, regardless of political \nparty.\n  As I served over the last year, it has become clear that we need more \noutsiders, more business people, and fewer--with all due respect--fewer \npoliticians.\n  Americans have high expectations for us. They are looking for \nleadership. They want results, and, right now, they want their lives \nback. They are looking for us to restore America and protect their \ndreams, not to take advantage of a crisis and expand the government.\n  They certainly don't want their way of life overwhelmed by radical \nchange and costly policies that will push them out of their job, limit \ntheir children's educational opportunities, and threaten their right to \nworship and speak freely.\n  At the same time, while those on the left feign a desire for unity, \nthey say they cannot tolerate it without accountability. In essence, \nthere can be no unity without conforming to their views. Disagree, and \nyou will be canceled, and not just your social media account but your \njob, your family, your educational opportunities, and even your God-\ngiven rights. Only those who meet the ideological purity test can claim \nmoral superiority and maintain their voice.\n  Over the last year, I experienced this firsthand many times. Yes, I \nhave been a proud champion of conservative values, but I always put \nGeorgia first ahead of politics. As the pandemic began to unfold, I \nworked around the clock to deliver relief across Georgia, yet the \nmainstream media, including my own hometown newspaper, flooded its \npages not with serious coverage of my relief efforts but with \ncompletely false stories about stock trades fabricated by a leftwing \nblog.\n  When this political attack was thoroughly debunked, that fact was \nlargely omitted from subsequent coverage to fit their narrative. The \ntruth is, the mainstream media and Big Tech increasingly care only \nabout advancing their political ideology and protecting only the speech \nthat fits into their specific narrative. The double standards, disdain, \nand contempt that elites and institutions of influence have for \nconservatives is increasingly being revealed. For the sake of our \ndiscourse, this cannot continue.\n  As a starting point, we must hold accountable those who limit our \nfree speech and the loss of our civil discourse in this country. The \nAmerican people are alarmed by the effort to censor conservative \nvoices. We are witnessing a constitutional crisis that threatens to \nerode the First Amendment and silence people across our country. As a \nRepublican and a conservative American who still believes in the \nConstitution and the core principles on which our country was founded, \nI refuse to be intimidated by the cancel culture and its dangerous \nnarratives.\n  However, not every American feels free to speak up. Their voices are \nbeing lost.\n  This is why this Senate is so important. For 230 years, the U.S. \nSenate has been the central venue for voicing dissenting views, and it \nhas celebrated the deliberation of issues confronting our Nation.\n  You must be the voice for those who can't use theirs. Now is the \ntime. The urgency weighs on our country. If we are serious about \nuniting, it must be out of respect for diversity, not despite it. \nDiversity of belief is not monolithic.\n  In 1964, a future President Ronald Reagan spoke to his fellow \nAmericans saying:\n\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve \n     for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or \n     we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand \n     years of darkness.\n\n  These sage words echo today. These words are timeless.\n  To my colleagues in the Senate, I urge you to address the dire \nthreats to our First Amendment rights in order to restore every \nAmerican's faith in our democracy and to help restore our trust in each \nother. It is the only way to ensure that America, the world's shining \ncity on the hill, a republic admired for centuries, can endure for \nfuture generations.\n  I encourage each of you to uphold our uniquely American values and \npreserve the American dream, and I will continue to champion our \nparty's values from whatever position I occupy. America depends on it. \nAmericans are counting on us to be their voice.\n  For a shy farm girl who was the first in her family to graduate from \ncollege, who could never have imagined that one day I would serve as \nthe U.S. Senator from the great State of Georgia, thank you all. It has \nbeen my deepest honor.\n  May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I make my prepared remarks, I would \nlike to note the fact that this is the first time that I am returning \nto the floor of the Senate since the events of January 6. It was in the \nearly morning hours of January 7 that we concluded our business and \nleft this Chamber to return to our homes for the interim period.\n  We left, knowing that something terrible had happened in this \nbuilding on January 6, but we didn't know the extent of it. As Members \nof the Senate, we were largely protected from this terrorist \ninsurrection, which took place in this building.\n  It was about 2:15 p.m. on that afternoon of January 6, when Vice \nPresident Pence was presiding over the Senate and most of us were in \nour seats, that there was a commotion at the Chair and the Secret \nService came in and literally pulled the Vice President away from that \npodium and took him out the door. We weren't sure what was happening. \nIt all unfolded quickly. There was an effort to make a quorum call to \ndetermine which Senators were on the floor. It was interrupted when a \nrepresentative of the Capitol Police stood where the Presiding Officer \nis now seated and instructed us to stay in this room, in this Chamber, \nin the Senate, in our chairs. The staff people and surrounding offices \nwere going to line the walls. This was going to be a safe place of \nrefuge for whatever was going on.\n  I remember that moment particularly because something happened, which \nis etched in my memory. Two plain clothes officers came down into the \nwell of the Senate and stood there, just a few feet from where I am \nstanding. One of them had an automatic weapon around his neck. I \ncouldn't imagine what was going on, where, in the U.S. Senate Chamber, \nit was necessary to have that kind of firepower.\n  He stayed there for a few minutes, and then we were told to leave and \nleave quickly. We filed out the doors and down the steps and walked \nacross through the tunnel to the Hart building, where Members of the \nSenate were safely protected.\n  That is one of the reasons I wanted to say a word this afternoon and \nthis morning. The Capitol Police, throughout this, were heroic. They \nwere overwhelmed by this massive insurrectionist mob. The Capitol \nPolice, as well as the others who joined them--the DC Metropolitan \nPolice and other law enforcement agencies, which I don't know the names \nof as I stand here--I want to thank them all for literally risking \ntheir lives for me, for Members of the Senate, for our staff, and \nvisitors.\n  It wasn't until the next day that we learned--that many of us \nlearned--that a Capitol policeman had been killed--killed by this mob. \nMy heart goes out to him and his family. I thank him and all of his \ncolleagues, men and women, who each day get up in the morning, put on \ntheir uniforms, and come to this building to protect me and protect the \nother Members of the Senate and the House and all of the staff who work \nhere. We will never be able to repay them in any words for what they \nsacrificed and risked on January 6, but let us never, never demean what \nhappened that day. It was a terrorist attack--homegrown American \nterrorist attack.\n  I know we are going to spend some time discussing who provoked that \nattack. The Republican majority leader laid the blame, as he should \nhave, at the feet of the President, who invited this group to \nWashington and then urged them to come march on Capitol Hill. I know we \nwill go into this matter with more detail at a later point.\n  But the fact of the matter is, we endured a great travesty and a \ngreat violation of our Republic on that day. To think that in this \nbuilding--this building that we value so much--so many people came in \nhell-bent on death and kidnapping and destroying this great Chamber and \nthe building around it. It is inconceivable that this happened in \nAmerica, and we have to come to grips with it in honest, truthful terms \nand not say: Oh, that was yesterday's newspaper, and we have to move \non.\n  But there is good news--good news in light of the bad news that I \nhave just recounted. The good news is that by this time tomorrow, we \nwill have a new President and a new Vice President of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, as we begin the Congress and prepare to \nwelcome President Biden and Vice President Harris, I find myself \nthinking of the words of the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi. He wrote, \n``Out beyond the ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. \nI'll meet you there.''\n  For the moment that we are living through, I would edit his words \nslightly. I would say: Out beyond the ideas of right versus left, out \nbeyond the rigid confines of our current polarized politics, there is a \nfield of common good and common purpose. I hope we will all find the \ncourage to meet there, to work together in this place.\n  At another moment of dangerous division in America, Abraham Lincoln \nprayed that the ``better angels of our nature'' would help us to \nrediscover our common bond and pull back from the brink of a civil war.\n  Today, the Union, preserved through that war, is battered and \ndivided. For the first time since the Civil War, thousands of Federal \ntroops stand guard at our Nation's Capitol to protect it from attack by \nAmerican citizens.\n  Carpenters and other crafts people are still hard at work repairing \nthe doors and windows and furniture smashed to bits less than 2 weeks \nago by the insurrectionist mob. We must be better than this or we risk \nlosing our democracy.\n  I believe that beyond the killing field of weaponized politics, there \nis still a field of shared dreams, which brings me to a specific reason \nI take the floor of the Senate today.\n  I come to thank a remarkable woman who has devoted countless hours \nover many years trying to help the Members of this Senate, Democrats \nand Republicans, find that field on which we can work together.\n  Reema Dodin has been a member of my staff for more than 14 years. She \nstarted as a law school intern in my Chicago office, and over the \nyears, she rose through the ranks: legislative assistant; research \ndirector; Judiciary Committee staff member; floor counsel; and finally \nmy deputy chief of staff.\n  For years, my person on the Senate floor has been this woman, this \namazing woman. I am grateful for her service to the Senate and her \nservice to the people of Illinois and to our Nation. But tomorrow Reema \nbegins a new challenge as Deputy Director of the White House Office of \nLegislative Affairs. This daughter of immigrants will make history as \nthe highest ranking Palestinian-American woman ever to work in the \nexecutive branch of the President of the United States.\n  As the liaison to the U.S. Senate, she will continue to help the \nSenate search for common ground on which to build a better future; only \nnow she will be doing it from a different office, with a much better \nboss.\n  I know that she will be a tremendous asset to President Biden and the \nNation. In these divided times, it is rare to find a public servant \nlike Reema, whose excellence and integrity is so widely admired on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  No one understands better than Reema--well, perhaps two people in the \nChamber might understand better--how this Senate works but only two. As \nthe saying goes, she wrote the book on it, coauthoring an insightful \ntome entitled ``Inside Congress: A Guide for Navigating the Politics of \nthe House and Senate Floors,'' published in 2017 by the Brookings \nInstitution. It came this close to being a New York Times bestseller. \nBut maybe still, with this speech today, it will reinvigorate sales.\n  As floor director for the Senate Democrats, Reema has worked closely \nwith staff and Members on both sides of the aisle to whip bills and \novercome hurdles. No matter how long or pitched the debate, she has \nalways remained friendly, decent, optimistic, and dedicated. It was not \nunusual to find her still at her desk at midnight or 2 in the morning, \nsending her final whip alert or email of the day to Senate staffers \nsummarizing the day's activities and the next day's Senate agenda.\n  Reema acquired her political and diplomatic acumen through hard work\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nand partly, it seems, through genetics. Her grandfather served as \nSocial Affairs Minister for the Kingdom of Jordan under King Hussein \nand was involved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the \n1970s.\n  As I mentioned, Reema, like so many Americans, including myself, is a \nchild of immigrants. Her parents both came to the United States as \ncollege students from Hebron, in the occupied West Bank.\n  Reema was born in North Carolina and grew up in Orange County, CA. \nShe graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, earned her \nlaw degree from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, and we \nmade her an honorary daughter of the land of Lincoln. She also is a \nTruman National Security fellow; a New Leaders Council fellow; an Aspen \nSocrates alumnus; a former term-member of the Council on Foreign \nRelations; and a member of the Jenkins Hill Society, a consortium of \nwomen in politics supporting women politicians.\n  Reema loves the Senate, and she loves the challenge of this great \nChamber. She loves to give tours in this Chamber to those who want to \nknow the procedure and the history of this beautiful room in American \nhistory and the Capitol of our Nation. She cares about the people who \nprotect and preserve this building, including the maintenance people, \ncafeteria workers, and everyone who works here.\n  Even after so many years of climbing the marble staircase from the \nSenate floor to my office, she and I remain in awe of those time-worn \nsteps, the colorful Minton tiles that brighten the Senate floors, and \nthe majestic Brumidi frescos that adorn the walls.\n  During the recent siege of the Capitol, Reema worried for the safety \nof Senators and their staff, police officers, and troops who were \ndefending this building, but she also worried about the priceless \npaintings, statues, and other historical treasures that had been passed \ndown from one generation to the next as part of our national legacy.\n  Most of all, I know that Reema reveres the Senate as the place where \nmen and women representing all of the people and all of the competing \ninterests of the United States can reason and work together for the \ncommon good of our Nation.\n  In her personal inscription to her book on the Senate, Reema thanked \nme for taking a chance on folks with only dreams and no connections.\n  Well, Reema, tomorrow when you join the staff of the President of the \nUnited States, Joe Biden, you will have the best connections in \nWashington, and I know that you will use whatever opportunity presents \nitself on this new assignment to bridge the gaps in America and bring \ntogether the people of this country in a better, more caring nation.\n  I will forever be grateful for your many years of brilliant, loyal \nservice, and I wish you the best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WICKER). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, in the Christian faith, there is a saying: \n``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for \nhis friends.'' I rise today to talk about that kind of sacrifice, that \nkind of love, and ultimately that tragedy in the death of a man who is \na hero.\n  Officer Brian David Sicknick was many things. He was a loving son to \nhis parents, Gladys and Charles Sicknick; a loving brother to Ken and \nCraig Sicknick; and a loving partner of 11 years to Sandra Garza. He \nloved his two dachshunds, Sparky and Pebbles, and he took great care of \nthem.\n  Many of us got to know Officer Sicknick because he served in the \nCapitol Police Department. He was someone who loved his job and \nunderstood that every day when you put on that uniform, when you come \nto the Capitol of the greatest power on the planet, the United States \nof America, that wearing that uniform, wearing that badge, you had a \nsacred duty to protect this sacred space.\n  I am proud to say that Officer Sicknick was a Jersey guy through and \nthrough. He was born in New Brunswick, NJ, raised in South River, and \nhe lived a life committed to the greatest calling you can have, which \nis to serve others, to protect others, to defend not just your Nation \nbut her citizens. He was a member of the New Jersey Air National Guard. \nHe loved his country. And I am proud to say he loved Jersey too. He was \na New Jersey Devils fan. He proudly, in his work and commitment, served \nhis country in the 108th Security Forces Squadron in Saudi Arabia and \nKyrgyzstan.\n  Officer Sicknick was a reliable and cherished colleague. If you talk \nto those who knew him, they knew that he was a man of honor and decency \nand kindness. They knew he loved this job. He loved being a Capitol \nPolice officer. He loved serving this Nation. He loved helping people. \nHe loved his work.\n  That love is evident in so many stories shared by his family and \nfriends, people who, in this time of painful grief, are still \ncelebrating the life he lived even though it was cut short by hate. \nPeople speak to his character and the qualities, the values that made \nhim so special. He was kind. He was patient. Like many of those who \nrise in their service to this country, he was humble. And he was \nselfless.\n  You talk to people who knew him really well, and they remember him as \nthe kind of officer who would go out of his way, not just in his \nservice to those of us who frequent the Capitol but to make sure that \nhis colleagues, his fellow Capitol Police officers, were also doing OK. \nHe was not just a leader; he was a servant. And they remember him \nliving with that sense of honor and that sense of duty. They remember \nhim as the kind of person who would stand courageously in the face of a \ncolleague, who would sacrifice for them, who believed that service \nmeant commitment, meant bringing your grit and your guts and your love. \nAnd that is what he did.\n  On January 6, 2021, when a violent mob attacked this Capitol, Officer \nSicknick stood for America. He stood for this Capitol and all of its \ninhabitants. He was steadfast. He was courageous. He stood in the \nbreach to protect the lives of the Members of this body, their staffs, \npersonnel. He faced down terrorist attackers and sacrificed himself, \nhis own safety, his own security, and ultimately his life in the name \nof love of country and of the countrymen and--women.\n  Officer Sicknick is the very definition of a hero, and he deserves to \nbe remembered for the richness of his life, the way that he loved, and \nthe devotion that he gave this Nation. That he is no longer with us \ntoday is a grievous tragedy, and it is also a crime. This great man was \nmurdered. This crime demands the full attention of Federal law \nenforcement officials. Anyone who still harbors doubt about what \nhappened here on January 6 should think of him.\n  On January 6, when extremists, when terrorists, when White \nsupremacists attacked our Nation's Capitol, they took the life of one \nof our officers. They spilled his blood. They took a son away from his \nparents. They took a sibling away from his brothers. They committed \nthis treachery while waving flags, claiming solidarity--some of them--\nwith law enforcement, but it was hate--it was hate; it was hate--that \nbrought terror to our Capitol and the death of one of our sons.\n  So many of the words that led up to that day, the lies that were \ntold, the incitement and the encouragement, came from the highest \noffice of our land to dotted members of authority across our country--\nthese collective actions that led to the moment, the terrorists who are \ndirectly responsible as well.\n  In the aftermath, a hero, a Capitol Police officer, is dead-- a \nchampion, a hero. This is a senseless tragedy, an awful crime. I am not \nalone when I say to Officer Sicknick's family and loved ones that we--\nthat I vow to hold those responsible for this heinous crime \naccountable.\n  We must honor Officer Sicknick's heroism and sacrifice not just with \nour words but by what we do here in the coming days, what we do as a \nnation, how we all take responsibility in the aftermath of a horrific \nmoment.\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n  Officer Sicknick died for this country. He did not die in vain. We, \nthe living, must--must--continue with his level of courage as we tell \nthe truth, as we hold others responsible and for account, as we try to \nlive in the spirit that he lived: with humility, honor, courage, \nkindness, love, decency.\n  May Officer Brian Sicknick always be remembered for his service to \nthe country he loved, and may we rise to his example and honor him. All \nthose who have fallen in defense of this Nation, may we honor them in \nhow we live for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mrs. CAPITO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Blackburn.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, as the most senior Republican Senator \nin the Republican majority, I have had the privilege to serve as Senate \nPresident pro tempore in the 116th Congress. The last time a Senator \nfrom Iowa served in this constitutional office was 100 years ago. For \nthe last 2 years, it has been my great honor each day to open the \nbusiness of the Senate, welcome Chaplain Barry C. Black to lead us in \nopening prayer and recite the Pledge of Allegiance with my colleagues \nand staff. It was a distinct honor to enroll bills with my signature \nbefore they left Capitol Hill for the President's desk to be signed \ninto law.\n  Today, I pay tribute to a group of selfless professionals who was \nassigned to serve as my security detail. As this body knows, the \nPresident pro tempore serves in the Presidential line of succession and \nreceives 24-hour protection. Now, as most Americans might imagine, it \ntook some time to get accustomed to having a security detail following \nmy every step, around the clock, 365 days a year. These dedicated \nprofessionals made the transition as seamless as possible. They served \nwith integrity, discretion, and professionalism. Some of them might not \nhave known the journey in store when they embarked 2 years ago on this \nassignment. By journey, I refer of course to my heavy travel schedule. \nFor starters, I return nearly every weekend to Iowa and whenever the \nSenate is not in session. And lest anyone imagine there is a nonstop \ncommercial flight between the Nation's Capital and my farm in Butler \nCounty, I will disabuse anyone of that fairy tale.\n  Agents on my security detail became frequent fliers and intimately \nfamiliar with the map of Iowa. My work schedule includes my annual 99 \ncounty meetings across the State. Last year, I finished my 40th \nconsecutive year holding meetings with Iowans in courthouses, schools, \nfactory floors, hospitals, and service clubs. Typically, Iowa weather \nadds a bit of uncertainty to the schedule. Last year, the pandemic \nopened a whole new can of worms. I want to thank my security detail for \ndoing an exceptional job these past 2 years. I can confirm none of the \nagents indulges in a treat from Dairy Queen as much as I do.\n  My security detail also learned on day one of their assignment that I \nam an early bird. I like to wake up early and get my morning jog in \nbefore the sun crests the horizon. They learned every step of my route \nin northern Virginia and the country gravel roads in Butler County, IA. \nThe agents showed an exemplary work ethic and respect for punctuality \nwhich, as my staff and many Iowans who attend my meetings know, is very \nimportant to me. I don't like to waste time or money, especially on the \ntaxpayer dime.\n  Today, I salute the following members of the U.S. Capitol Police \nDignitary Protection Division: Supervisory Agent David Rib, Agent Eric \nBoggs, Agent Shane Powell, Agent John Brito, Agent Eric Love, Agent \nZachary Madera, Agent Daniel Murphy, Agent Arnold Pierre, Agent Luis \nPimentel, Agent Ryan Rayball, Agent Zachary Samson, Agent John Whittle, \nAgent Joseph Larue, Agent Justin Godfrey, Agent Michael Bell, Agent \nCaleb Horton, Agent Muhammed Khan, Agent Tobey Murray, Agent Robert \nSchultz, Agent Travis Scott, Agent Richard Dahl, Agent Brandon Exum, \nAgent Carlos Fonseca, Agent Louis Mannella, Agent Brooke Littlewood, \nAgent Nicholas Koffarnus, Agent Wayland Massengill, Agent Jesse Cole, \nAgent Todd Sindelar, Agent Cory Flere, Agent Gabriel Santos-Muniz, and \nAgent Nicholas Wirth.\n  Barbara and I enjoyed teaching some of the agents about agriculture \nat the Iowa State Fair. Together, we rooted for UNI Panthers wrestling, \nbasketball, and volleyball on many occasions. Many of them became fond \nof Iowa. They discovered the meaning of ``Iowa Nice.'' Iowa will \nwelcome you back anytime for a visit.\n  Barbara and I have enjoyed getting to know you and for giving the \nfull measure of devotion to your job to keep me safe and sound. The \nCapitol riots on January 6 revealed how seriously you take your oaths \nof office and I sincerely thank you for putting yourselves in harm's \nway on my behalf. We wish you and your families all the best in the \nyears ahead.\n  Speaking about the violent attacks that took place in the U.S. \nCapitol, on the 6th of January, I also extend my appreciation to the \nlegion of Capitol Police officers who protect this sacred civic space. \nThey put their lives on the line every day to put the safety of others \nbefore their own. They keep watch over 535 members of Congress, the \nthousands of staffers who serve the American people here in the \nlegislative branch, and the millions of people and youth groups who \ncome every year to visit the U.S. Capitol. The riots serve as a stark \nreminder never to take law enforcement for granted. We mourn the loss \nof two Capitol Police officers--Officer Brian D. Sicknick and Officer \nHoward Liebengood--who lost their lives this month. Barbara and I \ncontinue to pray for them and the loved ones they leave behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The AN/AAQ-24(V)N LAIRCM system is a self-contained, \n     directed-energy countermeasures system designed to protect \n     aircraft from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. The \n     LAIRCM system features digital technology micro-miniature \n     solid-state electronics. The system operates in all \n     conditions, detecting incoming missiles and jamming infrared-\n     seeker equipped missiles with aimed bursts of laser energy. \n     The LAIRCM system consists of the Guardian Laser Transmitter \n     Assembly (GLTA), LAIRCM System Processor Replacement (LSPR), \n     multiple Missile Warning Sensors, the Control Interface Unit \n     Replacement (CIUR), and the Classified Memory Card User Data \n     Module. The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader is also a necessary \n     device.\n       2. The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is a \n     laser transmitter pointer/tracker subsystem designed to track \n     the inbound threat missile and point the laser jam source at \n     the missile's seeker. The GLTA automatically deploys the \n     countermeasure.\n       3. The LAIRCM System Processor Replacement (LSPR) analyzes \n     the data from each Missile Warning Senor and automatically \n     deploys the appropriate countermeasure via the GLTA. The LSPR \n     contains Built-in-Test (BIT) circuitry.\n       4. The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader is a portable, hand-held \n     device used for securely receiving, storing, and transferring \n     data between compatible cryptographic and communications \n     equipment.\n       5. The missile Warning Sensors detect and declare threat \n     missiles. The sensors are mounted on the aircraft exterior to \n     provide omni-directional protection. The sensors detect the \n     rocket plume of missiles and send appropriate data signals to \n     the LSPR for processing.\n       6. The Control Interface Unit Replacement (CIUR) displays \n     the incoming threat for the pilot to take appropriate action. \n     The CIUR also provides operator interface to program the \n     LAIRCM system to initiate built-in-test (BIT), to display \n     system status, and to provide the crew with bearing to threat \n     missile launch.\n       7. The Classified Memory Card User Data Module contains the \n     laser jam codes. The Classified Memory Card User Data Module \n     is loaded into the LSPR prior to flight; when not in use, the \n     Classified Memory Card User Data Module is removed from the \n     LSPR and put in secure storage.\n       8. The highest level of classification of information \n     included in this potential sale is SECRET.\n       9. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures that \n     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       10. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide \n     substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive \n     technology being released as the U.S. Government.

The highest level of information that may be transferred \n     in support of this proposed sale is classified SECRET.\n       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures which \n     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       4. A determination has been made that Kuwait can provide \n     substantially the same degree of protection of this \n     technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is \n     necessary in furtherance of U.S. foreign policy and national \n     security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.\n       5. All defense articles, technical data, and services \n     listed in this transmittal are authorized for release and \n     export to the Government of Kuwait\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"}
