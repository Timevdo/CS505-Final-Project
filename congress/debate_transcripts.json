Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that\n\n[[Page H5838]]\n\nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2089.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, S. 2089 was amended to replace the language of that \nbill with the language of H.R. 8150, the bipartisan and bicameral Keep \nKids Fed Act of 2022, in order to send the bill to the Senate for \nexpedited passage.\n  Roughly 2 years ago, our communities experienced an unprecedented \nsurge in child hunger, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Just weeks \ninto the pandemic, more than one of every three households with \nchildren, and nearly half of all mothers with young children, struggled \nwith food insecurity.\n  In response, Congress took decisive action to ensure that child \nnutrition programs, our best tools for addressing child hunger, could \ncontinue feeding hungry children during the pandemic.\n  One of the most important steps we took was providing child nutrition \nprograms with the flexibility they needed to expand access to school \nmeals and address the challenges of serving students who are not \nphysically in the school buildings.\n  This relief made a measurable difference in our fight against child \nhunger. By expanding access to child nutrition programs, we allowed an \nadditional 10 million students to receive free school meals each day. \nFrom January 2021 to April 2021, food shortages among households with \nchildren fell by more than 40 percent.\n  Regrettably, unless Congress acts, these key flexibilities would \nexpire at the end of this month.\n  The bipartisan and bicameral Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 is likely our \nbest and last opportunity to preserve relief for child nutrition \nprograms. This legislation would:\n  Maintain school meal flexibilities that do not increase costs;\n  Continue flexibilities to support summer food programs this year;\n  Provide additional support for child and adult care feeding programs; \nand\n  Increase school meal reimbursement rates for this upcoming school \nyear.\n  As we continue to recover from the pandemic, the Keep Kids Fed Act of \n2022 would take a critical step to support child nutrition programs and \nprevent children from going hungry during the ongoing public health \nemergency. This is a step well worth taking.\n  I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Dr. Foxx, and \nSenators Stabenow and Boozman for working with me on this legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this bipartisan legislation \nthat will help ensure students receive healthy school meals. Students \nneed access to nutritious meals so that they can be their best, both in \nand out of the classroom. Today's bipartisan legislation does just \nthat.\n  During pandemic lockdowns, school food programs were critical to \nthose in need. These programs play an important role in non-pandemic \ntimes, too.\n  It is important that we ensure this program is sustainable for \nschools, and that means responsible oversight and a return to regular \norder.\n  We want to make sure that students who rely on school meals have \naccess to them and that schools can continue to supply them, even in \nthe face of skyrocketing, record-high inflation.\n  As our constituents know, the price of just about everything has \nincreased. The average family is spending $450 more per month. Eggs are \nup 32 percent, milk is up 16 percent, and bacon is up 15 percent. Our \nschool meals programs are no exception to these rising costs.\n  This measure will help schools cope with rising food prices by \ntemporarily providing supplemental reimbursements as these programs \ntransition back to normal operations.\n  I do think it is very important to emphasize that these increases are \ntemporary and will last 1 year.\n  I appreciate the Democrats and the Senate for working with us to \nensure these are temporary, supplemental funds to address inflation \nspecifically. They are not an arbitrary increase in spending. Using the \ninflation crisis or the supply chain problem to increase Federal \nspending permanently would be especially unwise and irresponsible.\n  I also am glad the legislation requires USDA to provide school \nleaders and parents with support and guidance as the program \ntransitions to normal operations.\n  It is Congress' job to ensure these programs are working as \nefficiently and effectively as possible. It is our duty to make sure \nthese programs are fulfilling their intended purpose, which is to help \nstudents.\n  I am happy to see this legislation put these school nutrition \nprograms back on the right track.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), a distinguished member of the \nCommittee on Education and Labor and a leading advocate to reduce and \neliminate child hunger.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on \nthis legislation and for working tirelessly to negotiate a solution.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the Keep Kids \nFed Act. As food costs continue to soar, this critical legislation is a \nlifeline for millions of American families struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, one in nine children are food \ninsecure. This bipartisan legislation builds on my bill, the MEALS Act, \nto ensure children continue to receive school meals this summer. I am \nproud to have been part of this fight.\n  While I wish this agreement could have provided a permanent solution, \nthis is a vital step to prevent millions of children from going hungry \nthroughout the next few months. In the meantime, I will continue to \nfight for the passage of my bill, the Universal School Meals Program \nAct, to ensure that no child in the richest country in the world goes \nhungry.\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), a member of the Committee \non Education and Labor and chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce \nProtections.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise \ntoday for the millions of children who will go hungry next week if \nCongress does not extend child nutrition waivers.\n  No student or child should ever go hungry in our country. At the \nstart of the pandemic, Congress authorized waivers to help make it \neasier for schools to deliver meals to kids, and we gave 10 million \nmore children access to healthy food.\n  Given the reality of higher prices at the grocery store, children and \ntheir families can't afford to lose the free, nutritious meals \navailable at schools across the country. As a 40-year educator, I know \nhunger has been a crisis in our schools and our communities since long \nbefore the pandemic.\n  Madam Speaker, one in seven households today has a child struggling \nwith food insecurity. In my home State of North Carolina, food \ninsecurity has been a tragic fact of life for our kids and our \nstudents.\n  Before the pandemic, in North Carolina, 92,000 students were \nparticipating in the Summer Food Service Program, and 441,000 children \nwere receiving SNAP assistance.\n  These numbers have only gone up. Our choice is clear: We can choose \nto act, or we can let millions of children go hungry.\n  Madam Speaker, as always, I am standing with our students, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to support S. 2089, as amended.\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx), Republican leader of the Committee on \nEducation and Labor.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time.\n  Madam Speaker, evidence is clear that students are able to focus more \nat\n\n[[Page H5839]]\n\nschool if they are receiving adequate nutrition. Too many students are \nstill suffering from the harmful effects of school closures, and we \ncannot afford to let students fall further behind.\n  The rise in food prices is putting most Americans in a tight spot. \nThe same is true for schools. The bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act will \nempower schools to meet the crises our country is facing, from supply \nchain problems to record-high inflation.\n  It is, however, extremely important to emphasize that the support \nprovided in this legislation is both targeted and temporary, as all aid \nshould be. We also worked hard to ensure that this legislation was \nbudget-neutral so it does not put additional burden on taxpayers. \nImportantly, this legislation will return our Nation's school meal \nprograms to regular order. This is the primary reason I support this \nlegislation.\n  For over 2 years, Democrats used a permanent pandemic narrative to \nincrease Federal spending across the board, including within school \nmeal programs. This has fueled inflation. This is not only \nirresponsible but ignores the narrow limits Congress purposefully \nplaced on these programs.\n  Congress never intended to provide universal free breakfasts and \nlunches to all K-12 students regardless of need. By returning these \nprograms back to normal, we can uphold our responsibility to taxpayers \nand the principle that aid should be targeted and temporary.\n  The Keep Kids Fed Act offers a viable solution to the problems facing \nschool meal programs while also refocusing these programs on their \npurpose: helping students in need.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), the distinguished member of the \nCommittee on Education and Labor.\n  Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Keep Kids Fed Act, \nwhich will aim to ensure our communities, schools, and daycares can \nprovide healthy meals to children this summer.\n  At a time when parents are struggling to put food on the table and \nprices at the grocery store are at an all-time high, I am grateful for \nthis bicameral, bipartisan effort to address food insecurity.\n  Throughout my career, I have focused on making sure to stay in touch. \nI had the opportunity to sit with over 60 nutritionists for the school \nlunch programs, who had a sense of urgency and concern not about their \njobs, but about the rising costs and their ability to make sure that \nyoung people, K-12, are able to have the meals in a dignified matter, \nto be able to be educated and overcome obstacles, and to make sure that \nthey were fed and ready for class.\n  That being said, today, I thank Chairman Scott and all my colleagues \nfor their example to solve this immediate and pressing challenge, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues to ensure \nthat we create the ideal environments that allow all students to learn \nand thrive.\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two letters from No Kid Hungry \nand the Food Research and Action Center, better known as FRAC.\n\n                       [From Share Our Strength]\n\n Share Our Strength's Lisa Davis on the Introduction of the `Keep Kids \n               Fed' Act To Extend Child Nutrition Waivers\n\n       Washington, DC.--This afternoon, leadership from the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and the \n     House Committee on Education and Labor announced an agreement \n     to extend nationwide child nutrition waivers, which are set \n     to expire on June 30. The Keep Kids Fed Act would extend some \n     of these waivers through the 2022-2023 school year and \n     provide school nutrition programs with additional funding to \n     help address food price inflation and supply chain \n     challenges. The following is a statement from No Kid Hungry \n     Senior Vice President Lisa Davis:\n       ``We are grateful that a deal has come together to help \n     address the immense challenges facing schools and community \n     organizations working tirelessly to feed kids this summer and \n     during the school year. This issue couldn't be more urgent \n     with waivers expiring in nine days and summer meals programs \n     already up and running.\n       ``Time is of the essence, especially for those operating \n     summer meals sites without the certainty and flexibility of \n     the waivers who will face difficulties turning on a dime. We \n     know these waivers are needed and that they work. The reach \n     of the summer meals program increased dramatically with them, \n     doubling in 2021 and even tripling in 2020.\n       ``While these waivers don't solve supply chain issues, \n     lower the rising cost of food and gas, or solve our nation's \n     inflation problem, they do help soften their impact on \n     schools and community organizations and, ultimately, keep \n     kids fed and nourished.\n       ``As we know with legislation like this, there can be miles \n     to go before it gets across the finish line. We urge Congress \n     to move quickly on the Keep Kids Fed Act before nationwide \n     child nutrition waivers expire on June 30.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From Luis Guardia, president, Food Research & Action Center (FRAC)]\n\nHungry Children Can't Wait: Congress Must Act Quickly To Pass Critical \n                              Legislation\n\n       Washington, June 21, 2022.--FRAC commends the bi-partisan \n     legislation introduced today by Senate Agriculture Chairwoman \n     Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Ranking Member John Boozman (R-AR) \n     and House Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-VA) and \n     Ranking Member Virginia Foxx (R-NC), to help support \n     children, families, schools, and child care providers as they \n     struggle to recover from the fallout of the pandemic. \n     Provisions in the Keep Kids Fed Act would increase \n     reimbursements to schools and child care, support access to \n     summer meals by extending the summer waivers, allow children \n     eligible for reduced-price school meals to receive free \n     school meals, and streamline access to healthy meals for \n     children in family child care.\n       We and our network of anti-hunger advocates all across the \n     country call on Congress to pass this legislation immediately \n     as time is running out. The child nutrition waivers that have \n     been available since the onset of the pandemic are set to \n     expire on June 30. This legislation would help mitigate the \n     impact of the loss of the waivers and also would be critical \n     to supporting children's access to summer meals and meals at \n     childcare. The provisions in the legislation are only \n     temporary and do not go as far as we would like, but they are \n     a critical first step to help shield some of the impact of \n     inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages.\n       Still, more must be done. FRAC looks forward to working \n     with Congress to make much-needed, long-term improvements to \n     the child nutrition programs to more fully address our \n     nation's hunger crisis.\n       Hungry children can't wait.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Madam Speaker, the Keep Kids Fed Act is a bipartisan, budget-neutral \nbill that supports students and protects taxpayers. This bill will \nreturn our school nutrition programs back to normal, pre-pandemic \noperations. I appreciate the majority working with us to ensure this is \na true transition back to regular operation, which is fully paid for \nand includes a requirement to support parents and school leaders.\n  This legislation will also support schools dealing with the supply \nchain and inflation crisis. This allows our Nation's schools to focus \non delivering healthy meals for students so they can focus on being \nsuccessful in the classroom. I am pleased we were able to come to a \nbicameral and bipartisan solution, and I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthe Keep Kids Fed Act.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning of the debate, the \nlegislation before us is likely our last and best opportunity to \nprotect millions of students' access to nutrition programs, which have \nbeen critical to feeding hungry children during the pandemic.\n  The simple reality is that schools, children, and families are still \ndealing with the impacts of COVID-19. As school meal programs continue \nto endure supply chain disruptions, inflation, and other challenges, \nthe Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 would provide school meal programs that \nare urgently needed for stability and will help continue providing \nstudents with nutritious meals that they need.\n  We know this bill alone will not end all hunger in America, but it \nwill be an important step to stand up for our Nation's children and \nfulfill our basic responsibility to keep them from going hungry.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member of the committee, Dr. Foxx, and I \nthank the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Steel, for helping to bring\n\n[[Page H5840]]\n\nthis bipartisan, bicameral legislation to the floor. I also thank \nSenators Stabenow and Boozman for their work in bringing this \nlegislation to reality.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2089, as amended, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Keep Kids Fed \nAct, which provides vital funding to ensure our children are fed \nhealthy meals over these next few summer months--and that schools and \ndaycares are supported throughout the school year.\n  As one of the wealthiest nations in the world, no child should go \nhungry. Yet far too many children struggle with hunger in this country. \nThis is a tragedy. For more than 22 million children who rely on school \nbreakfast and lunch programs, summer vacation means worrying about when \nthey will eat next.\n  We all know that hunger can have lifelong consequences for children--\nmaking it more difficult to learn . . . play . . . and connect with \nkids their age. Kids who go hungry during summer often start school \nbehind, which can lead to serious health concerns like developmental \ndelays . . . chronic illness . . . and mental health issues. They are \nat higher risk for anemia, asthma, diabetes--and more likely to \nexperience anxiety and depression.\n  So, I am pleased that we have reached a bipartisan agreement on \nextending school meal waivers until the summer's end and continues to \nsupport schools and daycares throughout the year. These child nutrition \nwaivers are a lifeline to schools, children, and hardworking families \nacross the country.\n  During the pandemic, school meals were a lifeline to students--\nproviding them with healthy meals whether they were attending school in \nperson or virtually. They have been a critical component of our \nnation's response to this pandemic. But schools continue to face a \nvariety of challenges, including supply chain disruptions, labor \nshortages, serving meals safely, and rising food prices. Waivers have \nbeen vital this school year to support school nutrition. And extending \nthe waivers is the path forward to ensure all children have access to \nnutritious school meals over the summer months that they need to learn \nand thrive.\n  As I have said from the start--failure is not an option. And we need \nto get a deal across the finish line. It is our responsibility to \nensure that our children do not go hungry. School meal waivers have \ngiven stability to hundreds of children who prior to this program, \nlikely did not know where their next meal was coming from.\n  I am disappointed that House Republicans insisted on an offset. We \nneed to feed children in this country--and that should never be up for \ndebate.\n  With that, I am proud of this bill and the impact I know it will \nhave--providing school workers . . . parents . . . and caregivers with \nthe security of knowing that the children they care for will be fed \nthrough the summer.\n  So, I am voting in favor of this critical legislation--and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nthe Keep Kids Fed Act.\n  I want to thank Chairman Scott for his steadfast leadership and \ndetermination to work to get something worked out to help ensure that \nour school meals are available to as many of our students as possible.\n  The school meals provisions were an effective response by this \nCongress to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools, children and families were \ndisrupted as this deadly disease raced through our country. Congress \nacted to make sure that we provided flexibility to ensure that no child \nwould miss a meal that they would otherwise have received in school.\n  Why is that important? Because Congress has long recognized that \nhunger and learning do not mix well, if at all. This isn't some \ntheoretical or academic debate. I know what its like to be hungry and \nin school. And I am saddened that decades after I went through that \nexperience as a student, many other children still must deal with that \nreality each and every school day.\n  Food is not a luxury. So hearing that the USDA COVID waivers that had \nallowed millions of kids to stay nourished were expiring was an \nemergency for me. And I know the Chairman shares that sentiment.\n  Frankly, it has been hard to sleep thinking of what happens in \ncommunities like Milwaukee when families find this lifeline cut off \narbitrarily even while the pandemic that spawned these provisions, \ncontinues.\n  The reality is that hunger and food insecurity did not take a break \nduring this pandemic. In fact, reports indicate it got worse. Hunger \ndoesn't take a summer vacation even though our schools do.\n  It shouldn't have taken all of this to get us to agree on this: Feed \nour kids so they can concentrate on learning and being kids. These \nwaivers have done a great deal to help us achieve that and I hope we \ncan continue to work to ensure that we can take the great lessons \nlearned about how to effectively reach and nourish school children \nduring this pandemic and use them to put in place permanent provisions \nthat will ensure that all of our children can go to school and focus on \ntheir education\n  That includes taking up and passing bills like the Universal School \nMeals Program Act which I have joined with Rep. Omar in introducing \nthat would provide the most cost-effective and inclusive model for \nensuring all students have access to nutritious meals during the school \nday without facing barriers such as stigma or burdensome paperwork.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support \nof the House Amendment to S. 2089, the ``Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022.''\n  Today's bill is a matter of urgency.\n  If Congress does not act now to pass this emergency legislation, \nmillions of children will spend their summer hungry. Millions of \nchildren may be forced to spend their school days not learning and \ngrowing but feeling the pangs of empty stomachs.\n  Hungry children cannot focus their attention on their studies and \nlearning. They simply cannot thrive while trying to survive.\n  Free and reduced breakfast and lunch waivers are lifelines for \nfamilies across the nation.\n  I think of the struggling families in my district who have battled \nagainst the COVID-19 pandemic for the past two years.\n  Families who now face record high inflation rates, skyrocketing gas \nprices, and the rising cost of food.\n  Families who are stretching dollars to pay for rent, to get to the \ndoctor, to keep the lights on.\n  Families for whom every penny counts.\n  I think of how these families must have felt when they learned that \nthe aid on which they had relied to feed their children was suddenly \ngoing to be taken away.\n  I imagine they felt helpless.\n  It is in our power to feed these children.\n  The ``Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022'' would allow schools to feed \nchildren throughout the upcoming school year. This bill would extend \nfree meals and snacks for children during the summer months, and it \nwould provide enhanced supports to Child and Adult Care programs--all \nwithout disrupting the budget.\n  In the summer of 2020, hungry children were provided with more than \n10 million meals via the federally supported Summer Meal Program.\n  195,000 children were fed.\n  195,000 children were given apples, sandwiches, yogurts, juice boxes.\n  They were given the opportunity to enjoy a summer free of hunger.\n  That is reason enough to act.\n  The ``Keep Kids Fed Act'' would also increase reimbursements to \nschool nutrition programs for both breakfast and lunch meals.\n  American families are not the only ones struggling to put food on the \ntable amidst the current economic crisis.\n  School nutrition professionals have expressed deep concern over the \nimpacts that supply-chain issues and inflation have had on their \nability to provide quality meals to their students.\n  With the end of pandemic-relief nutritional aid fast approaching, and \nthe cost of labor rising, some schools could see their yearly budgets \ndecrease by 40 percent this year.\n  School cafeterias cannot produce meals out of thin air.\n  They need our help.\n  The House Amendment to S. 2089 would increase the reimbursement rates \nfor the 2022-2023 school year by an additional 15 cents per breakfast \nand 40 cents per lunch--money that our nation's schools desperately \nneed.\n  This bill would not fix the inflation problem, lower the cost of gas, \nor unclog the supply chain. But it would put food on the plates of \nhungry children across America.\n  That is why I rise in support of the House Amendment to S. 2089, the \n``Keep Kids Fed Act'' and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2089, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-05"}

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6064, introduced by \nRepresentative Nehls.\n  Given the unfortunate prevalence of military sexual trauma among \nveterans and the broad and long-lasting impacts it can have on a \nsurvivor, it makes sense to have a neutral research party assess the \nadequacy of compensation examinations conducted by VA examiners to \nensure we are fully addressing the needs of our veterans who have \nexperienced military sexual trauma.\n  The sensitive nature of MST evaluations requires competent and \ncompassionate care. Having a better understanding of the academic \npreparation and credentialing of medical and mental health \npractitioners will allow the VA to adjust and amend existing policy to \nprovide more appropriate compensation examinations.\n  The National Academies of Science provides independent and objective \nresearch that informs public policy. To that end, an empirical review \nof the practitioner training associated with MST compensation \nexaminations will strengthen stakeholder confidence in the overall \nprocess, improve customer service, and enhance claim decisions to \nbenefit veterans who experienced MST.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Nehls for offering this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6064, and I thank \nCongressman Nehls, Congresswoman Luria, and the leaders of the \nSubcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, for \nintroducing this bill.\n  This bill would require the VA to partner with the National Academies \nto conduct an independent review of the VA's delivery of benefits for \nclaims related to MST.\n  The National Academies would also provide recommendations that the VA \ncould implement to improve the disability claims process for MST \nsurvivors.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  For decades, the National Academies has led research into the VA \ndisability benefits process, including reports on the health effects of \ntoxic exposures and VA's handling of traumatic brain injury claims.\n  This study is needed to help Congress and VA better understand what \nchanges need to be made in this process to ensure that veterans receive \nquality, timely, and compassionate consideration of their disability \nclaims.\n  For too long, we have heard that the MST claims process can be \ninsensitive. This is unacceptable, and VA must do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to increase \npenalties for crimes against Federally protected activities relating to \nvoting and the conduct of elections, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the months of \nbipartisan hard work that have gone into two bills that we are filing \ntoday: the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition \nImprovement Act--I repeat--the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential \nTransition Improvement Act--and the Enhanced Election Security and \nProtection Act.\n  I would like to commend my dear friend Senator Susan Collins for her \nleadership throughout this process. She has been shepherding this \nthrough and working diligently, as only she can do, and she does it so \nwell.\n  We started these discussions back in January, when partisanship \naround here was at a fever pitch, a toxic environment that was \nabsolutely not conducive to things that needed to be done. But for \nthose who may not remember, we were in the middle of a heated debate \nover voting rights with both sides--Democrats and Republicans--equally \ndug in on their positions, and it was kind of hard to move people off \nof that.\n  The insurrection January 6 and the situation that has been going on \nsince 1887 and should have been corrected and had not been--but no one \never felt that we would have what we had. So now, we needed to take \ncare of it. And everyone stepped to the plate.\n  By January 19, my Democratic colleagues were so frustrated that they \nforced a vote on repealing the filibuster to allow that bill to pass \nwith a simple majority, along party lines. It appeared to many, both \ninside and outside of Washington, DC, that the Senate was fundamentally \nbroken. But Senator Collins and I have worked together for a long time, \nand we never gave up. We were not convinced it was broken, and you just \nhave to work a little bit harder.\n  They call us the most deliberative body. Well, to deliberate means to \ntalk, to converse; and when that fails, then, basically, the \ndeliberative body is no longer the deliberative body. And we were not \ngoing to let that happen to us.\n  We asked our colleagues and friends to come together to start trying \nto see if we could work together and find a pathway and find common \nground. Well--guess what--they did. So I am here to thank those who sat \ndown: Senator Portman, Rob Portman; we had Senator Murphy; we had \nSenator Romney, Senator Shaheen, Senator Murkowski, Senator Warren, \nSenator Tillis, Senator Sinema, Senator Capito, Senator Cardin, Senator \nYoung, Senator Coons, Senator Sasse, and Senator Graham.\n  Now, that was truly a team effort when you think about it. And this \nhas gone on for quite some time.\n  What we learned through those discussions was that there was \nbipartisan support for some important, commonsense reforms that would \nhelp restore Americans' faith in our democracy and how we basically \napply our democracy, how do we select our representative form of \ngovernment. Specifically, most of our group felt that we could and that \nwe should:\n  Reform the Electoral Count Act to remove the ambiguity that we saw \nweaponized after the last election. We were all in agreement.\n  Enhance the protections for local election officials who were facing \nunprecedented threats and intimidations. These are people who \nvolunteer, most basically. And it is basically a family handing down \ngeneration after generation, people who always believe that their civic \nduty is to be able to perform during election times.\n  We wanted to establish best practices for the U.S. Postal Service to \nimprove the handling of mail-in ballots. Mail-in ballots have been so \nconvenient to older people, shut-ins. And in the situation where we had \nthis pandemic, my goodness, it was the only way that people could vote.\n  So reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission to help States \nimprove the administration and the security of Federal elections.\n  The most important thing that we can do is that when that vote is \ncast and that vote is counted accurately, it has to be counted and \nreported accurately. And that is what we have to do and make sure that \nthere is not even a shred of a thought where a person might think that \ncount is not valid--it is not a valid count. And we have done \neverything we possibly can to make sure that we have cleared that up.\n  This is not everything that people on both sides of that wanted. Some \non our bipartisan committee wanted a lot more, and some didn't want to \nbasically interfere with the States' rights. So we were caught in \nbetwixt and between. We worked back and forth on different things we \ncould. We tried to put the guardrails on that gave guidance, and we \nthink that we came up with a piece of legislation.\n  And when you have every Member I just mentioned all sign on, with the \ndiversity of these memberships--we have almost 20; 20 Senators have \nbeen involved, coming equally between Democrats and Republicans, and \nable to come to an agreement--this is a bill that we should put \nforward.\n  I was proud to be an original sponsor of both the Freedom to Vote Act \nand the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and I still believe \nthat we can and we must continue working to protect every American's \nsacred right to vote. But we also have an obligation to the American \npeople to do the most good that we can right now--right now.\n  The confusing and antiquated language that we have on the books today \nfrom the 1887 Electoral Count Act is a real and present danger to our \ndemocracy. We can fix that, and that is exactly what we intend to do.\n  The increased threats and attacks we are seeing across the country on \npoll workers and election volunteers--we can fix that, too. But even \nmore important than the policy provisions contained in these two bills \nis the fact that we have Democrats and Republicans standing arm in arm \nproposing commonsense election reforms that can begin to restore \nAmericans' faith in our democracy. That is our solemn commitment and \npromise.\n  When Benjamin Franklin was asked whether the Constitutional \nConvention had given us a republic or a monarchy, he famously replied \n``A republic, young man, if you can keep it.''\n  He qualified his answer because he understood a democracy is fragile \nand can be lost if we are not careful. And while today's introduction \nis an important step in this process, we do have much work yet to do.\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n  I look forward to continuing our bipartisan effort to get this bill \nto the President's desk as quickly as possible and signed into law. And \nour journey begins.\n  And with that, I would like to yield to my dear friend from the great \nState of Maine, Senator Susan Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my close friend and \ndear colleague Senator Manchin in introducing bipartisan legislation to \nreform the archaic and ambiguous Electoral Count Act of 1887, the \nimportant law that governs how Congress tallies each State's electoral \nvotes for President and Vice President.\n  On January 6 of 2017, I was amused to learn that I had received one \nelectoral vote for Vice President of the United States, an office for \nwhich I obviously was not a candidate. But on January 6, 2021, I \nrealized that my unearned vote from 4 years earlier was really not \nfunny at all. Rather, it was an indication of deep structural problems \nwith our system of certifying and counting the electoral votes for \nPresident and Vice President. These unfortunate flaws are codified in \nthe 1887 Electoral Count Act.\n  In four of the past six Presidential elections, this process has been \nabused, with Members of both parties raising frivolous objections to \nelectoral votes. But it took the violent breach of the Capitol on \nJanuary 6 of 2021 to really shine a spotlight on the urgent need for \nreform.\n  Over the past several months, Senator Manchin and I have worked with \na terrific, bipartisan group of Senators who are united in our \ndetermination to prevent the flaws in this 135-year-old law from being \nused to undermine future Presidential elections.\n  I want to express my gratitude to my friend Senator Manchin and to \nall the members of our bipartisan group for their hard work, their \nconstructive work, to craft this legislation. Specifically, I want to \nthank Senators Portman, Sinema, Romney, Shaheen, Murkowski, Warner, \nTillis, Murphy, Capito, Cardin, Young, Coons, and Sasse for their work \nover several months. I also want to thank Senators Klobuchar and Blunt, \nwho head the Rules Committee, for their advice and counsel throughout \nthis process, and Senator Lindsey Graham for his insights and for \njoining as a cosponsor.\n  The legislation that we are introducing--the Electoral Count Reform \nand Presidential Transition Improvement Act--will help ensure that \nelectoral votes totaled by Congress accurately reflect each State's \npopular vote for President and Vice President.\n  Our bill includes a number of important reforms, but I want to \nhighlight just a few.\n  First, it reasserts that the constitutional role of the Vice \nPresident in counting electoral votes is strictly and solely \nministerial. The idea that any Vice President would have the power to \nunilaterally accept or reject or change or halt the electoral votes is \nantithetical to our Constitution and basic democratic principles.\n  Second, our bill raises the threshold to lodge an objection to \nelectors to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn members of \nthe House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Currently, only a \nsingle Member in both houses is required to object to an elector or a \nslate of electors.\n  Third, our legislation will ensure that Congress can identify a \nsingle, conclusive slate of electors by clearly identifying a single \nState official who is responsible for certifying a State's electors; \nrequiring Congress to defer to the slates of electors submitted by a \nState pursuant to the judgment of State or Federal courts; and \nproviding aggrieved Presidential candidates with an expedited judicial \nreview of Federal claims related to a State's certificate of electors. \nLet me be clear that this does not create a new cause of action. \nInstead, it will ensure prompt and efficient adjudication of disputes.\n  To help promote the orderly transfer of power, our bill also includes \nclear guidelines for when eligible Presidential candidates may receive \nFederal resources to support their transition into office. And I want \nto particularly thank Senators Portman, Coons, and Sasse for their hard \nwork on those provisions.\n  We are also introducing a second bill--the Enhanced Election Security \nand Protection Act--to address other issues pertaining to the \nadministration of elections. In the interest of time, let me just \nquickly note the major provisions of this bill. It would reauthorize \nthe Election Assistance Commission and require it to conduct additional \ncyber security testing of voting systems, a concept put forth by \nSenator Warren. It would improve the Postal Service's handling of \nelection mail. It would enhance current penalties for violent threats \nagainst election workers; and increase the maximum penalties for \ntampering with voting records, including certain electronic records, \nthat was the work of several members, including Senators Romney, \nShaheen, and Sinema, among others.\n  We have before us an historic opportunity to modernize and strengthen \nour system of certifying and counting the electoral votes for President \nand Vice President. January 6 reminded us that nothing is more \nessential to the survival of a democracy than the orderly transfer of \npower.\n  And there is nothing more essential to the orderly transfer of power \nthan clear rules for effecting it. I very much hope that Congress will \nseize this opportunity to enact these sensible and much-needed reforms \nbefore the end of this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, while my dear friend is here, I want to \ntell her, you know, 6 months ago--we have worked on this for 6 months. \nIt started in January, and it was 14 Senators who came at that time. We \njust started talking, and 14 Senators--with all of your support, Mr. \nPresident, also--we had support from everybody saying something had to \nbe done. But as delicate as this was, knowing that some might think we \nare picking on one side or the other or supporting or defending one \nside or the other, there was only one thing we were concerned about: \nHow do we defend this country and the Constitution and this wonderful \nCapitol that we have so this could never happen again?\n  January 6 is a black mark on the history of the United States of \nAmerica. And if you want to erase it, you better do what we did for 6 \nmonths, bringing people together to find a pathway forward so that type \nof opportunity--for some looking for an opportunity--to degrade our \ngovernment and our country and our form of governing ourselves could \nnever, ever encourage them thinking they could do something here at \nthis Capitol and disrupt us.\n  When that day happened, the thing I was most proud of, we were all \ndown in a secured room--and Senator Collins remembers--and it went on; \nwe didn't know what the extent of this was going on. We knew one thing: \nThey didn't come for a friendly visit. But we were down there talking; \nand, all of a sudden, someone said: Well, let's just conduct our \nbusiness down here. Remember that? And to a T, everybody in that room \nsays, No, no, no. They are not going to run us out of our body here. \nAnd we all came back here later that night and finished our business.\n  What we did--and Senator Collins has led this admirably--is make sure \nthat we are finishing our business. We are just starting it now to \nprotect this democracy. This form of democracy that we have is a \nrepresentative form and the Republic that we are responsible for. And I \nam just so proud to be part of it. And she is my dear friend. We worked \nmany, many years together, and we will continue to.\n  But I just want to thank the Senator for the hard work--our staffs \nworked together. I am very proud of all our staffs that they worked \ntogether for the betterment of our country.\n  So when people think that bipartisanship is not capable of happening \nin Washington, I want to say: Watch, we have proved them wrong. We have \ndone so many things together, and we will continue to. Again, I say \nthank you to all those who participated for just hanging in there. It \ntook us 6 months to get here, but we have just begun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, want to salute all of the members \nof our group who worked so hard over many months. As is always the case \nwhen you delve into a complicated issue, it turns out that there are \nfar\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\nmore nuances and complexities than you would think when you first look \nat the issue. But everyone continued to work for the common good to \nstrengthen the procedures, to update this archaic and ambiguous law \nthat was written in the language of another era. And we have \naccomplished that. And I really hope our colleagues will all join \ntogether and that in the end we can have an overwhelming vote.\n  Finally, I, too, want to thank our staff members for their \nextraordinary work. They worked literally night and day to work through \nthe many thorny issues and to help bring us together. So my thanks not \nonly to the Members but to their staffs as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-28"}

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Carson) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Webster) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n\n\n                             general leave\n\n  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on S. 3662, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3662, the Preventing PFAS Runoff \nat Airports Act, sponsored by Senator Peters from Michigan.\n  Mr. Speaker, every day millions of Americans are exposed to highly \ntoxic fluorinated chemicals known as PFAS, through either their \ndrinking water, home appliances, retail packaging, or countless other \nthings they come into contact with each and every day.\n  These chemicals, known as ``forever chemicals'' due to their long-\nterm persistence and inability to be easily broken down when released \ninto the environment, have been linked with numerous human health \nrisks, including increased risk of cancer, immune system impairment, \nand impaired child development. And that is just what we know. There is \nstill plenty that we don't know about these hazardous materials and \nchemicals.\n  Unfortunately, these chemicals are also likely to be found in and \naround many of our Nation's airports. That is because airports have \nbeen required by law to use and discharge firefighting foam containing \nPFAS; not just during firefighting emergencies, but also to comply with \nmandatory FAA testing requirements for firefighting equipment. These \ndischarges have tremendous health implications for the people who live \nand work around airports, as well as growing liability concerns for the \nairports themselves.\n  Fortunately, there has been significant progress on this front. For \ninstance, just last month, the EPA proposed designating two of the most \nwidely used PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances, which would create \nmore public transparencies around the release of these chemicals. And \nthe FAA is in the process of transitioning away from mandating the use \nof airport firefighting foam containing PFAS--though the agency still \nhas to offer PFAS-free alternatives.\n  Furthermore, the FAA now allows for airports to sufficiently test \ntheir firefighting equipment without discharging PFAS outside of the \nvehicle. But while these efforts should be celebrated, more work must \nbe done.\n  That is why I support this bill, which would raise the Federal cost \nshare to 100 percent for airports that use Federal Airport Improvements \nProgram funds to acquire input-based testing equipment, which enables \nairports to test firefighting equipment without emitting toxic PFAS \nsubstances. While airports are already allowed to procure this \nequipment, the cost of the equipment--which can be tens of thousands of \ndollars--can often be prohibitive.\n  Through this higher Federal cost share, S. 3662 would incentivize the \nbroad adoption of this new technology to ensure airports are able to \nlimit or prevent the spread of PFAS contamination into local \ncommunities.\n  In addition, the bill would require the FAA to provide Congress with \noptions for reimbursing airports that use AIP funds to require input-\nbased testing equipment under a lower Federal cost share standard or \nacquire this equipment without AIP funds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, ensuring the safety of the traveling public is of \ncritical importance to this Committee. To ensure aviation safety, the \nFederal Aviation Administration regulates airport firefighting \nstandards and requires airports to regularly test firefighting \nequipment.\n  Currently, the fire suppressant foam required to be used at airports \ncontains PFAS. While FAA is working closely with the Department of \nDefense to come up with an alternative that is just as effective at \nsuppressing jet fuel fires, there is still work to be done before that \nalternative is made available.\n  Given that, this bill ensures that airports are able to acquire \nequipment to test firefighting vehicles, in compliance with FAA \nregulations, without discharging PFAS-laden foam.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously, and \nI urge support. This legislation is a good piece of legislation, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in closing, S. 3662 is a minor \nadjustment of an AIP cost share to remove any barriers an airport might \nhave for acquiring firefighting testing equipment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, in closing, by making this small change to \nthe Federal AIP, this bill would make it much easier to protect the \nhealth of our airport workers, first responders, and local communities, \nas well as bolster our Nation's ability to continue fighting these \ndangerous and insidious chemicals.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legislation and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 3662, as amended.\n\n[[Page H8170]]\n\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-10-01"}

Madam President, it has been a momentous 24 hours here \nin the Congress.\n  A legislative one-two punch that the American people rarely see. A \nlittle while ago, the House voted to approve the largest investment in \ndecades to lower costs, increase manufacturing, invest in science, and \nhelp fix the semiconductor crisis. The CHIPS and Science bill now goes \nto the President's desk after 3 long years.\n  And, last night, Senator Manchin and I announced an agreement on the \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022, a bill that will take historic steps \nto lower costs, fight climate change, and make healthcare more \naffordable in this country.\n  Again, the past 24 hours have been a legislative one-two punch that \nAmericans rarely ever see and which will benefit them immensely: first, \na bill that will supercharge the American industry and now a bill that \nwill fight inflation and mark a turning point in our fight against \nclimate change.\n  This morning, I met with my Democratic colleagues to review the big \nwins contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and we discussed \nour plan for passing it through reconciliation next week.\n  With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, this Senate majority will \nfinally take on Big Pharma and lower prescription drug prices.\n  This Senate Democratic majority will tackle the climate crisis with \nthe largest package on the climate ever. This Senate majority will \nensure we close tax loopholes and make the wealthy corporations and \nindividuals pay their fair share, and this Senate Democratic majority \nwill fight inflation and reduce the deficit.\n  The Inflation Reduction Act is common sense; it is bold; and it is \nvery much needed. For decades, many in Washington have promised to \naddress these challenges. But where previous efforts have fallen short, \nSenate Democrats in this majority will move swiftly to deliver to the \nAmerican people.\n  Now, there is so much to like in the Inflation Reduction Act. By a \nwide margin, this legislation will be the largest action on climate \nchange ever passed by the Congress.\n  Like the creation of the EPA and the passage of the Clean Air Act \nhalf a century ago, this legislation will mark a turning point in our \nNation's commitment to protect our planet for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Through this bill, we will at last put the United States on a path to \nroughly 40 percent emission reductions by 2030. And it will help us \nachieve climate justice for communities long left behind, especially \ncommunities of color. But that is not all, for many years, people in \nWashington--including President Trump, including the Republican \nSenate--promised to lower the cost of prescription drugs, but they \nfailed to follow through.\n  Under this Senate Democratic majority, that is changing. Our proposal \nwill finally lower the cost of prescription drugs by empowering \nMedicare--for the first time ever--to negotiate the prices of certain \ndrugs in Part B and Part D.\n  We will prevent healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for millions of \nAmericans in the coming months. And through it all, we will ensure that \nno small business or family making under $400,000 a year will see their \ntaxes go up.\n  Republicans go on and on and on about how this is a tax on the \nAmerican people. No, Republicans, you try to hide the truth. The truth \nis this bill will close tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest \nAmericans and largest corporations and will not touch Americans who \nmake below $400,000 a year. Why don't you say that? Because you know \nyour tax policies are so unpopular with the American people, which we \nproved in 2017. You tried the same shibboleth then. Oh, we are cutting \ntaxes for the American people. We Democrats make clear to the American \npeople, no, no, no, they were cutting taxes on the very wealthy. And by \nthe time the 2018 campaigns rolled around, they didn't even mention it. \nWe are going to do the same thing now. We are going to tell the truth.\n\n  Yes, we are raising taxes on very wealthy people and big corporations \nthat pay no money, not on average Americans, and you are afraid to do \nthat.\n  The American people want these tax reforms. They support making sure \nthe ultrarich and big corporations play by the rules and pay their fair \nshare. It is common sense. The American people know that.\n  So when Republicans fret and panic about taxes, the truth is what \nthey really hate is the idea of increasing taxes on Big Business and \nthose at the very top.\n  And they are afraid to admit to the American people that they know \nthey are on the wrong side of the issue. As I said, Republicans should \nhave learned their lesson in 2018 when the American people rejected \ntheir tax cuts for rich Americans.\n  We all saw what the results are, what happens when Republicans cut \ntaxes for the ultrarich and corporations: It\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nfuels hundreds of billions in corporate stock buybacks, and since then, \nstock buybacks have only increased.\n  According to S&P, buybacks are forecast to reach a trillion dollars \nthis year. The American people don't want a tax code that is skewed to \nthe top 1 percent, which is what happened under Republicans, under \nPresident Trump when they had the majority.\n  Republicans really know that, so they, in fear--they distract and \ndistort and ignore the fact that under our plan, small business and \nmiddle-class families making under 400,000 won't see their taxes go up \nat all.\n  It is the same thing for the deficit. For years, Republicans have \nhowled at the Moon about lowering the Federal deficit, but when they \nwere in the majority, they blew a $2 trillion hole in our deficit in \norder to pay for their gargantuan tax cuts to big corporations and the \nultrarich.\n  The Democrats' proposal will actually lower the deficit \nsignificantly, which will go a long way to easing inflation.\n  If Republicans really care about fighting inflation, if they really \ncare about lowering the deficit as they claimed, they should support \nour proposal, which would lower the deficit by hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  Now, at the end of the day, the American people want us to do a few \ncommonsense things: Lower the cost of their daily expenses like \nhealthcare, protect our planet for future generations, make sure \neveryone plays by the same rules and has a fair shot at achieving the \nAmerican dream, and that is what the Inflation Reduction Act will do.\n  These are not easy matters, but we didn't come here to do easy \nthings. To be sure, the work is not done. There is a lot we have to do \nin the coming days, but I am proud that right now we have a strong, \nbold package to move on, one that will lower inflation, fight the \nclimate crisis, and help preserve America's place as a nation of \nimmense opportunity into the 21st century.\n  Let us get to work and pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-28"}

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 203, S. 66.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 66) to require the Inter-Agency Task Force on \n     Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to develop a plan for \n     reducing, mitigating, and controlling harmful algal blooms \n     and hypoxia in South Florida, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am proud to be a champion of the \nHarmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act--or HABHRCA--\nprogram. The program was first created in 1998 to help address harmful \nalgal blooms in water bodies across the country. Congress recognized \nthe devastating impact of harmful algal blooms, both ecologically and \neconomically, and the importance of providing resources to the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to advance scientific \nunderstanding of harmful algal blooms, as well as the ability to \ndetect, monitor, assess, and predict bloom events.\n  In 2014 and again in 2018, I worked with then-Senator Bill Nelson to \nreauthorize the program in a bipartisan way. And in the 2014 \nlegislation, I worked to ensure that freshwater bodies, specifically \nthe Great Lakes, were a focus for the program for the first time. Since \nthen, I have worked to secure funding for the HABHRCA program through \nthe annual appropriations process.\n  I am pleased to report that, today, NOAA's work through the HABHRCA \nprogram is being used by my constituents and others across the Great \nLakes basin. For example, I hear from the fishing and charter boat \nindustries that they rely on NOAA's biweekly forecasts to monitor the \nlocation of the blooms so they know what areas of the lake to avoid in \norder to continue operating their tourism and fishing businesses.\n  It also helps our drinking water systems prevent contamination in \ndrinking water because they are able to anticipate additional treatment \nneeds if the location of the bloom is near a water intake valve. This \nwill help prevent crises similar to the 2014 water crisis in Toledo, \nOH, in which nearly half a million people lost access to safe drinking \nwater because a harmful algal bloom contaminated the city's water \nsupply.\n  As cochair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I am committed to \nensuring our Great Lakes communities have the resources they need to \ncreate jobs and protect the water quality and health of the lakes.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, has a bill that would amend \nthe HABHRCA program to require NOAA to conduct harmful algal bloom and \nhypoxia work specifically for the South Florida ecosystem. I am \nsupportive of this legislation and of efforts to address harmful algal \nblooms across the country, so long as it does not take away or divert \nresources that are used in the Great Lakes.\n  To that end, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from NOAA Administrator Spinrad committing that the \nwork done in South Florida, such as would be the case with passage of \nSenator Rubio's legislation, S. 66, the South Florida Clean Coastal \nWaters Act, would have no impact on the resources and work currently \nbeing conducted to support the Great Lakes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 3, 2022.\n     Hon. Robert Portman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Portman: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     the importance of maintaining harmful algal bloom (HAB) and \n     hypoxia research and monitoring activities in the Great Lakes \n     region. I appreciate the discussion that you and I had about \n     this issue last week.\n       As you know, NOAA has monitored and forecast cyanobacteria \n     bloom location and concentration in Lake Erie since 2009. The \n     early seasonal ``rolling'' outlook beginning in May estimates \n     bloom severity based on measurements of phosphorous loading \n     from the Maumee River combined with long-range forecasts and \n     historical records. The Lake Erie HAB Seasonal Forecast \n     issued in early summer allows coastal managers, lake users, \n     and drinking water facility operators to make informed \n     decisions based on the potential severity of the bloom. In \n     addition, the Lake Erie HAB forecast issued twice a week \n     during bloom season (July-October) provides the current bloom \n     extent and 5-day outlooks of where the bloom will travel and \n     what concentrations are likely to be seen, allowing managers \n     to determine whether to take preventive actions.\n       As we discussed, NOAA is committed to continuing this \n     important work and to pursuing improvements to Lake Erie HAB \n     detection, monitoring, and forecasting to keep communities in \n     the Great Lakes region safe. Additional proposals to complete \n     HABs work in the South Florida ecosystem will not impact the \n     resources necessary for Great Lakes HABs work through the \n     Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of \n     1998. The President's Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request \n     includes an increase for NOAA's Coastal Science and \n     Assessment programs that, if appropriated, will support these \n     efforts and build capacity in other areas.\n       We appreciate your interest and look forward to our \n     continued partnership. If you have further questions, please \n     contact Makeda Okolo, Director of NOAA's Office of \n     Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dr. Richard W. Spinrad,\n       Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and \n     NOAA Administrator.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third \ntime and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 66) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was \nread the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, let me thank Chairman Carper and Ranking \nMember Capito and my counterpart on the Subcommittee on Infrastructure, \nSenator Cramer, for bringing us to this moment where we will soon be \nvoting on the Water Resources Development Act.\n  I must tell you, this is an extremely important bill that gives the \nArmy Corps the authorization they need to advance critically important \nwater projects in our country.\n  Mr. President, this was passed by a unanimous vote in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. Due to the leadership of Senator Carper and \nSenator Capito, this bill involves the input of all the members of our \ncommittee and--dare I say--all the Members of the U.S. Senate. So I \nwant to thank them for getting this bill to the point where we will be \nable to vote on it this afternoon.\n  This bill is truly bipartisan. It incorporates the input from every \nsingle Senator and reflects priorities for our\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nwater resources in States and communities across the country. It \nprovides crucial authority for projects and guidance for the Army Corps \nof Engineers to engineer better solutions to our Nation's toughest \nwater infrastructure supply and quality challenges.\n  The work of the Army Corps of Engineers is vital for keeping commerce \nflowing in our waterways, for restoring aquatic ecosystems, and for \nhelping communities deal with the risks and impacts of flooding.\n  In my State of Maryland, we have challenges in all of these areas, \nand we are partnering with the Army Corps to address them. The Port of \nBaltimore, for example, is critical in our national supply chains and \nan economic engine for the State of Maryland.\n  To enhance the port's ability to serve commerce and provide safe \nnavigation, the Army Corps is moving forward with a Mid-Chesapeake Bay \nIsland Ecosystem Restoration Project, or Mid-Bay, which will put \ndredged material to beneficial use restoring our ecosystems in the \nChesapeake Bay, a major win-win for commerce and the environment. Here \nwe are taking dredged materials and using it for environmental \nrestoration, providing a very popular place to put dredged material so \nwe can keep our harbors and our channels dredged but we also can \nrestore our environment at the same time.\n  A project the size of Mid-Bay also has the opportunity to benefit \nsmaller channels along the Chesapeake Bay. In Maryland, we have dozens \nand dozens of smaller channels that support economic activity, \nrecreational opportunities, and are an integral part of the identity of \nthe small communities they serve, but these channels have not received \nthe maintenance that they require.\n  I am proud that this year's WRDA bill provides the Corps with new \nauthorization to address these underserved harbors and channels, \ndirecting the Corps to take a closer look at them according to the \nsignificance to their community and not just based on the total amount \nof cargo they move. This is going to help many of our communities \naround America.\n  In doing so, this bill adds new perspective to the Army Corps' \nthinking so that the Chesapeake Bay is fully understood not just as an \nartery for commerce but as a national environmental treasure that is \nhome to living waterfronts that support a variety of community, \neconomic, and nature-based activities. The WRDA reauthorization takes \nan important step in that direction with its provisions for underserved \nharbors.\n  I am also proud that this bill includes a new statewide authorization \nfor the Army Corps to provide assistance to Maryland on environmental \ninfrastructure. We very much will take advantage of this opportunity. \nWe know that we have challenges with the Chesapeake Bay, and this \nenvironmental study assistance will certainly help us in meeting our \nobligations.\n  This authorization will also help communities across my State deal \nwith the impact of aging infrastructure and move forward on the backlog \nof critical repairs and upgrades to water supply, wastewater, and \nstormwater infrastructure.\n  The bill recognizes that because the Army Corps work is in high \ndemand around the country, the Corps needs to be accessible to \ncommunities and engage with them directly on the challenges they face. \nThe Planning Assistance to States Program, which has been so important \nto Maryland, will now include a new authority for the Corps to conduct \nthis outreach to communities.\n  The Army Corps is carrying out its important work on navigation, \nflood risk mitigation, ecosystem restoration, and environmental \ninfrastructure against the backdrop of a worsening climate crisis.\n  This reality is forcing us to act with new urgency to protect our \ncommunities from multiple hazards that our country is already \nexperiencing with increased frequency and severity, including \nconcentrated catastrophic rainfall events, sea level rise, and the \nassociated erosion and flooding that these impacts bring. It is also \nforcing us to prioritize the restoration of ecosystems harmed by \nclimate change that can still play a role in building resilience. All \nof that is incorporated in this bill, and we will be able to have those \ntools that are available.\n  I just want to mention that one example is marshlands, which absorb \ntons of carbon dioxide in the United States each year. They buffer \nwaves and reduce flooding during storms. We had a hearing in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee yesterday--it was a good \nhearing--on how we can get carbon capture. Well, one of the ways we can \nget carbon capture through natural causes is to restore wetlands, which \ntrap carbon, and this bill will allow us to move forward in that \ndirection.\n  Finally, I want to note that, this year, the Army Corps' Baltimore \nDistrict is celebrating its 175th anniversary. I congratulate the \nBaltimore District on this important milestone. The district has played \nan instrumental role in the history of our Nation and the State of \nMaryland, dating back to the construction of Fort McHenry, and I am \nproud of the ongoing partnership of Colonel Pinchasin, the current \nregional director.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I again applaud the \ngreat leadership we have on our committee, the very open way that we do \nbusiness, the way that we listen to each other and are able to get the \npriorities accomplished.\n  To Senator Carper and Senator Capito and Senator Cramer, it is a \npleasure to work with you, and thank you for making this possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin, for his good, hard work with Senator Cramer on \nthe subcommittee. Senator Cardin and I share the Chesapeake Bay. He has \ngot a lot more of it than I do, but we have worked on those issues for \nyears together, and I think that shows his dedication not just to his \nState but to the environment. So I appreciate all of his efforts.\n  I am very pleased to rise today in strong support of the bipartisan \nWater Resources Development Act of 2022. This is the bill we are \nconsidering today. We call it WRDA. Most of us know it as WRDA.\n  Congress authorizes water resource projects and sets national \npolicies for the Civil Works Program and for the U.S. Corps of \nEngineers. The work of the Corps facilitates commerce throughout the \ncountry and internationally. Projects along our inland waterways, which \nare important in my State, and in our ports enable the movement of \ncargo while also bolstering our supply chain. Their support and \npartnership during this process were integral for us to reach a solid \nagreement.\n  So, Mr. Chair, I would like to thank you and your staff, and I am \ngoing to go through our staff list really quickly: Mary Frances Repko, \nJohn Kane, Jordan Baugh, Mayely Boyce, Tyler Hofmann-Reardon, Milo \nGoodell, and Janine Barr from your staff.\n  So thank you all very, very much.\n  Today proves, again, the ability of our EPW Committee to develop \nbipartisan infrastructure legislation that addresses the needs of \nSenators in the communities that we represent. Our colleagues submitted \nmore than 800 policy and project priorities to the committee. We worked \nhard to thoughtfully incorporate a majority of their requests into this \nlegislation, and I think that shows with the vote we got in committee.\n  True to the Corps' tradition, the bill moves forward projects that \nbenefit local communities and the entire country.\n  We know that natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes can \nstrike at any time and have devastating consequences for our \ncommunities. The Corps' work to protect the lives and livelihoods of \nmillions of Americans is furthered by congressional authorization of \nflood and coastal storm risk management projects.\n  Since 2014, Congress has enacted WRDA every 2 years, and I am \nthrilled that we are here again continuing that tradition. I again want \nto thank Chairman Carper for his leadership and dedication to this \ncritical piece of legislation, as well as--and I think I already \nmentioned them, but I will mention them again because Senator Cardin \nand Senator Cramer have been\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nvery integral as the subcommittee chairs.\n  Specifically, the WRDA bill authorizes 30 projects around the \ncountry, including projects for navigation, flood and coastal storm \nrisk management, and ecosystem restoration. One such project is a \ncoastal storm risk management project along the eastern coast of Texas. \nThink of all of the hurricanes and damage that we have heard over the \nyears that have come in on the eastern shore at Galveston and Houston. \nThis will help mitigate the impacts of future hurricanes and ensure \nthat critical port assets can continue to serve our country's shipping \nand supply chain needs as we are moving forward.\n  The bill also directs the Corps to expedite the completion of 24 \npreviously authorized projects, and it authorizes 36 studies that will \ndevelop solutions to water resources challenges that we have ahead.\n  While this bill is very much oriented toward advancing critical \nprojects and studies in our States, it also includes several policy \nchanges that I would like to highlight. At the beginning of this \nprocess, I outlined areas in which I believe changes would be \nbeneficial. I said we needed to reduce the confusion that some \ncommunities experience when they are dealing with the Corps and ensure \nmore effective delivery of our projects--and efficient delivery. So the \nbill bolsters the Agency's technical assistance authorities, \nspecifically the Floodplain Management Services and Planning Assistance \nto States Program--again, one that impacts my State greatly.\n  This bill authorizes the Corps to conduct outreach to ensure that our \ncommunities are knowledgeable of the ways in which the Agency can help \nthem with their water resources needs. It directs the Corps to \ndesignate staff in each district that can do this outreach.\n  The bill makes important improvements to the Tribal Partnership \nProgram and other authorities to assist Indian Tribes. It also expands \nexisting programs and includes new authorities to assist communities \nthat are economically disadvantaged, including those located in rural \nareas.\n  It requires reporting on timelines for the environmental review \nprocess for projects. The bill directs the GAO to conduct a study: a \nreview of projects that are overbudgeted and delayed--find out what is \ngoing on--as well as a review of the Corps' mitigation practices for \nprojects.\n  The bill includes several provisions that improve flexibility with \nregard to financial accounting; for example, the bill allows Federal \nAgencies to provide funding to help satisfy the non-Federal sponsor's \ncontribution for a project or study under certain circumstances. It \nauthorizes, for the first time, a dedicated research and development \naccount for the Corps to spur innovation and provides contracting \nflexibility in undertaking these activities.\n  The bill directs the Corps to support science, technology, \nengineering, and math--STEM--education and recruit individuals for \ncareers at this Agency. The input of non-Federal entities is crucial to \nsuccessfully resolving water resources challenges now and in the \nfuture.\n  This bill establishes a new advisory committee for non-Federal \ninterests to voice their opinions on how the Corps can better meet \ntheir needs.\n  We preserve the integral part of the non-Federal cost share partners \nin the project delivery process by avoiding mandates from Washington, \nDC, and ensuring that the Corps continues to evaluate a full array of \nsolutions during the feasibility study phase.\n  In addition to my role as a ranking member, I represent the great \nState of West Virginia, and I worked to address the needs of my home \nState. Here are just a few highlights before I close.\n  This legislation advances a critical flood control project of the \ncity of Milton, WV. Authorized in the 1990s, this project is longtime \ncoming, and I am proud to have helped move it forward.\n  The bill also supports flood control studies for the Kanawha River \nBasin and the city of Huntington. And it continues to provide \nenvironmental infrastructure assistance to communities throughout the \nState.\n  Finally, the bill will provide additional critical support to \nriverbank stabilizations such as those on the Kanawha River.\n  In closing, there is a lot in this bill--I could go on and on, but I \nwon't--for communities across the country. It is the culmination of a \ntrue bipartisan agreement and represents our shared goal of addressing \nthe Nation's water resources needs.\n  I am very proud of our committee. I am very proud to be here today \nwith you. We are active; we are cooperative; and we are fruitful. We \nget things done. I like that. It is a testament to the values and goals \nthat Chairman Carper and I share, and it is a testament to our personal \nfriendship and our working relationship. Thank you for that.\n  Before I close, I would like to thank my staff as well for all of \ntheir hard work and dedication to seeing that we get this across the \nfinish line: Adam Tomlinson, Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend, \nKatherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, and Haden Miller.\n  I would also like to thank the technical assistance that we received \nfrom the U.S. Corps of Engineers staff: Amy Klein, Dave Wethington, and \ncountless other technical staff.\n  And, then, from Senate legislative counsel, we would like to thank \nDeanna Edwards.\n  I look forward to a rousing vote here in a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I could not improve upon what has already \nbeen said about the work on this important bill. Senator Capito has \narticulated much more eloquently than I all of the priorities that are \nimportant in the bill.\n  I am just going to add my thanks to Chairman Carper and to Ranking \nMember Capito and, of course, to subcommittee Chairman Cardin as well. \nIt has been a great team effort, as is, I think, illustrated in the \nfinal product and the overwhelming vote. Let's keep the team together. \nAnd let's just pass a really big, important WRDA bill.\n  And I emphasize again, we did this through regular order, colleagues. \nWe stayed on the 2-year schedule, colleagues. And when we work \ntogether, we can do good work for the people we serve.\n  With that, I urge a strong vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cramer not just \nfor his words but--I will take my mask off--not just for his words but \nfor his great participation, he and his staff, in this effort.\n  I don't think it has been said in our short time we have been on the \nfloor here this morning: In the subcommittee, we don't just make up \nthis legislation. We have a tradition of reaching out to other Senate \noffices. We reached out to all 100 Senate offices. We ask everybody--\nDemocrat, Republican, a couple of Independents--and say: What are your \npriorities? What would you like to see prioritized, included in this \nlegislation?\n  We received feedback and input from, I think, every single office. \nAnd we have tried to reflect that input in this legislation.\n  So this is very much a community effort. And for everyone who has \nparticipated, thank you for doing so and putting us in a position today \nto vote and, hopefully, in an affirmative way.\n  Before we do vote, I just want to express one more time my very, very \nstrong support for the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. As we \nhave heard before this bill: Affectionately known as WRDA, it is an \nambitious, bipartisan water resources package that ensures the timely \nreauthorization of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer studies and \nprojects. The bill also equips the Corps with critical authorities to \nrestore ecosystems and protect communities from climate-change-\nexacerbated events like flooding and drought.\n  This legislation is a product of tireless commitment to \nbipartisanship and doing the right thing. Senator Capito, Senator \nCardin, Senator Cramer, and myself and our staffs look past the party \ndifferences and find, once more, a path forward on critical \ninfrastructure needs, just as we did last year on the bipartisan \ninfrastructure bill that the President signed into law late last year.\n\n  This is not the first time we have done this, and it won't be the \nlast. This Congress, the Environmental Public Works Committee, has \nconsistently advanced bipartisan legislation on drinking water; \nlegislation on wastewater;\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nlegislation on transportation--roads, highways, bridges--and on \nrecycling just today, just today. All of those bills passed EPW \nunanimously, just like this Army Corps of Engineers bill passed \nunanimously.\n  As EPW chairman, I am quite proud of the committee's work. I just \nwish that everybody in the country who thinks that all we do is fight \naround here and agree on nothing--I wish they had a chance to kind of \ntune in and maybe be a fly on the wall and hear how when you work \ntogether, you can get some amazing stuff done and really important, \nreally important things, as well, for all of our States, for every \ncorner of this country.\n  A word, if I could, about the Army Corps of Engineers. I am a Navy \nguy. I spent something like 23 years Active Reserve Duty. I am the last \nVietnam veteran serving here. But I have huge respect--huge respect--\nfor the Army Corps of Engineers. I like to say: Different uniforms, \nsame team. And in my State and, frankly, all 50 States, they do \nextraordinary work--sometimes without a lot of recognition, without a \nlot of thanks. And I just want to say, we recognize you in Delaware; we \nrecognize you even in the Navy; and we are deeply grateful for the work \nthat you do, the great work you do. We couldn't do a lot of what we do \nwithout your help. And this legislation is needed for the Army Corps to \nmeet their responsibilities and obligations.\n  But all the bills that I mentioned earlier passed committee \nunanimously, as did this bill. And, again, we are so proud of the \ncommittee's work.\n  What a joy it is to work with Senator Capito. And I wish I could say \nthe same thing about her staff. No. I am just joking.\n  Adam, you know we love working with you and your team, and we are \nreally privileged.\n  We were privileged to be led on our side of the staff by Mary Frances \nRepko, who is new at this. She has not worked long for many weeks or \nmonths on the Hill. Actually, she has probably for a quarter of a \ncentury or so, and I think she started at the age of 12. She has done a \nlot, and she still has a lot of gas in the tank.\n  But going back to the Corps--the Corps is the principal steward of \nour Nation's water infrastructure, and it serves both as a facilitator \nand protector of our diverse economy.\n  This bill--WRDA 2022--recognizes that the Corps is an essential part \nof our lives. This bill takes critical steps to better support the \nAgency as it serves all parts of our country. From navigation to \necosystem restoration and flood control, the Corps is the backbone--\nreally, the foundation, if you will, on which our country was built.\n  I would like to reiterate that every provision in this bill is the \nresult of bipartisan work. I can confidently say that WRDA 2022 will \nbenefit all corners of our nation--from Alaska to California to \nKentucky to New York, from Maryland to rural towns and every place in \nbetween.\n  Again, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to staff on the \nDemocratic side, the majority staff, and to Senator Capito's staff on \nthe minority side, the Republican side.\n  Actually, you can walk into a meeting, some of the meetings we have \nwith Senator Capito and myself and our staffs, and if you didn't know \nwho worked for whom, you wouldn't know. You wouldn't know, which I \nthink is an amazing thing, a wonderful thing.\n  With that in mind, again, I want to thank again my staff and Senate \nCapito's staff who worked so hard. I want to recognize, again, Mary \nFrances Repko and Adam Tomlinson for their dedicated leadership on the \nDemocratic side and the Republican side of our committee.\n  I also want to thank Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend, \nKatherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, Haden Miller, Mayely Boyce, Tyler \nHofmann Reardon, Jordan Baugh, Milo Goodell, Janine Barr, and John \nKane--especially John Kane--for their tireless efforts.\n  John, you are a force of nature. And thank you very, very much for \nyour great leadership.\n  I would like to say, again--I just said that, so I am not going to \nsay that again. I also want to thank Amy Klein and David Wethington of \nthe Corps--Amy Klein and David Wethington of the Corps--for their \ncountless hours of technical assistance and support as the bill was \ndeveloped.\n  In closing, I want to encourage all of our colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this excellent bill, because every State stands to benefit \nfrom the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2022, affectionately known as WRDA. Not only is this \nbiennial legislation an ambitious water resources bill, it is also the \nproduct of a tireless commitment to bipartisanship. Earlier this year, \nwe reached out to all 100 Senators to solicit their input for this \nlegislation. We developed this legislation using that feedback, and in \nMay, we advanced this legislation out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee by a vote of 20 to 0, something I am quite proud of as \nEPW chairman.\n  In these times of partisan divide, it is not often we see legislation \nreceive unanimous support. But, as we all know, bipartisan solutions \nare lasting solutions. That is how I think we should approach much of \nour work in the Senate--by reaching across the aisle to find lasting \nsolutions, where possible, to the problems we face as a nation. The \nbill before us today is a result of that partnership.\n  Before I delve into all we accomplish in this bill, let me thank \neveryone who played a role in its development--especially our EPW \ncommittee ranking member, Senator Capito, our Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee chair, Senator Cardin, our subcommittee \nranking member, Senator Cramer, every member of our committee, and the \nmembers of our staffs. I also want to thank the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers for supporting us throughout the drafting process.\n  This legislation continues the 2-year cycle for WRDA. By passing it, \nwe will ensure timely authorization of the Army Corps' studies and \nprojects. This work is critical in supporting our economy, restoring \ncritical ecosystems, and protecting communities from climate change and \nextreme weather events like flooding and drought.\n  When we talk about WRDA, I cannot overstate just how important the \nArmy Corps' work is in the lives of Americans across the country. The \nCorps is the principal steward of our Nation's water infrastructure. \nThat includes our beaches, our waterways, and our flood control \nsystems. Without the enactment of WRDA, our economy could well grind to \na halt.\n  The Corps operates and maintains America's water highway, a 12,000-\nmile-long system of inland waterways with 209 locks that are vital to \ndomestic and international commerce. Each year, more than 500 million \ntons of commodities move through this system, including 60 percent of \nour Nation's agricultural exports. Operating and maintaining this \nextensive network results in an economic benefit of nearly $14 billion \neach year for our country.\n  In addition to managing the waterways that connect our ports to world \ncommerce, the Army Corps of Engineers is also responsible for ensuring \nsafe, reliable, and efficient navigation at our coastal ports. As we \nhave seen over the past 2 years, navigable shipping channels are \nessential to keeping global supply chains moving.\n  More than 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade volume moves through the \n13,000 miles of coastal channels maintained by the Corps, supporting \nover 30 million jobs across the country. Cargo activity at our Nation's \nports supports more than a quarter of the U.S. economy. And, over the \nnext decade, an estimated $66 billion in future investment will be \nneeded to ensure continued domestic job creation and economic growth.\n  Recognizing the economic importance of our Nation's inland shipping \nchannels, WRDA 2022 adjusts the Inland Waterways Trust Fund cost share \nto expedite much needed project improvements.\n  The legislation also addresses the harbor deepening and maintenance \nneeds of commercially significant ports, as well as underserved \ncommunity harbors. While commercially significant ports are vital to \nour Nation's economy, community harbors are similarly important to \nlocal and regional economies.\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n  WRDA 2022 ensures that these community harbors, which provide \nessential fishing, recreation, and navigation services, will continue \nto receive maintenance that will allow for their continued use.\n  As a recovering Governor, I often like to say that it is our \nresponsibility as elected officials to create a nurturing environment \nfor job creation and job preservation. Maintaining our ports and \ncoastal waterways is a cornerstone of that nurturing environment.\n  The Corps is also a leader in flood and storm damage mitigation and \necosystem restoration. In addition to managing over 700 dams and more \nthan 13,000 miles of levees and floodwalls, it restores and nourishes \nthe Nation's dunes and beaches, constructs and maintains wetlands and \nfloodplains, and protects shorelines and riverbanks.\n  In total, the Corps' flood and coastal storm risk management \nactivities, and infrastructure portfolio, provide the nation an \neconomic benefit of nearly $260 billion in damage prevention and \nreduction. This is critical to understand because more than 40 percent \nof our Nation's population lives in coastal counties. If coastal \ncounties were their own nation, they would rank third in the world in \ngross domestic product--beaten out only by China and the United States \nas a whole.\n  This work is especially important for the communities I represent in \nDelaware. Earlier this year, on the Saturday before Mother's Day, a \nnor'easter pummeled beaches up and down the Delmarva Peninsula. When I \ntoured the damage, it was staggering to think that in 2 weeks, these \ncommunities needed to be ready for the first real beach season since \nthe start of the COVID pandemic.\n  While many beaches had experienced severe erosion and destruction, \nthe dune system that the Corps had built worked as designed and \nprotected Delmarva communities from the storm. Homes and buildings \nremained intact. Businesses could still operate. States were prepared \nto handle the storm because of the work that the Army Corps had done. \nNow, we are working with the Corps to rebuild these beaches, which are \nthe lifeblood of our States' economies.\n  Water, as we all know, is essential for life and a critical input \ninto virtually all economic activity. It is hard--in fact, it is \nimpossible--to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, \nwithout the use of water and water-related infrastructure. \nUnfortunately, climate change is fueling extreme weather in the form of \nlonger and stronger noreasters, hurricanes, and droughts. This \nthreatens the Corps' ability to be a good steward of our water \ninfrastructure, as well as that infrastructure's ability to protect and \nsupport our economy.\n  And this is not just a problem for coastal communities. For inland \ncommunities like those along the Missouri River, climate change means \nheavier and more frequent precipitation events, inland flooding, \nriverbank erosion, and the inundation of water treatment systems with \nsediments and contaminants in some areas. For other communities out \nwest, climate change means historic droughts, water shortages, and \ndeeply destructive wildfires.\n  The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 recognizes these \nchallenges posed by climate change. It accounts for the new realities \nthat the Corps faces in carrying out its primary missions and takes \ncritical steps to address these looming concerns. How?\n  First, WRDA 2022 overhauls the Corps' project development \nauthorities, allowing the agency to better address the impacts of \nclimate change. This will make a big difference in States like Arizona, \nwhere we are witnessing the worst drought conditions along the Colorado \nRiver in 12,000 years.\n  Under our legislation, the Corps and local project sponsors will, for \nthe first time, be able to partner and develop cost-shared plans to \naddress drought risk management and water supply conservation during \nthe planning, constructing, and operating of water resources \ndevelopment projects.\n  Communities in coastal States will also be able to develop projects \nthat address their specific climate-related impacts. This means that we \nwill see projects better formulated to combat sea level rise, as well \nas back bay flooding or even sunny day tidal changes instead of just \nstorm surge protection.\n  In addition to overhauling the Corps' project development \nauthorities, WRDA 2022 makes clear that the protection and restoration \nof shorelines and riverbanks from erosion and other damaging forces is \na primary responsibility. It also improves the Corps' ability to make \nshorelines and riverbanks more resilient.\n  In crafting this legislation, we also made equity a top priority. I \nam pleased to report that WRDA 2022 builds on the significant inroads \nmade in WRDA 2020 to rectify historical inequities for Tribal and \ndisadvantaged communities.\n  WRDA 2022 establishes a new Tribal and Disadvantaged Communities \nAdvisory Committee to help the Corps more effectively deliver projects, \nprograms, and other assistance to these communities. It also makes \npermanent the 2020 pilot programs that cover cost shares for \neconomically disadvantaged communities.\n  In addition, this legislation reauthorizes the Corps' Tribal \nPartnership Program and makes a series of targeted improvements to \nincrease opportunities for Tribal communities to partner with the Corps \non essential projects in a more cost-effective way.\n  Finally, WRDA 2022 establishes a new workforce development and STEM \noutreach program at the Corps with a priority to recruit new engineers \nfrom historically disadvantaged communities.\n  As we move to the consideration of the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2022, I am reminded of an old African proverb that goes \nsomething like this: ``If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to \ngo far, travel together.'' On this bill, we can proudly say that we \nhave chosen to travel together.\n  With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to thank my staff \nand Ranking Member Capito's staff who together spent tireless hours \ndrafting and negotiating each provision in this bill.\n  I would like to recognize our staff directors, Mary Frances Repko and \nAdam Tomlinson, for their dedicated leadership.\n  I would also like to thank Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend, \nKatherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, Haden Miller, Mayely Boyce, Tyler \nHofmann-Reardon, Jordan Baugh, Milo Goodell, Janine Barr, and John Kane \nfor their tireless efforts.\n  I like to say that if you walked in a room and saw our staff in \ndiscussions, you would be impressed at how well they work together--\neven when discussing difficult issues.\n  I would also like to thank Amy Klein and David Wethington of the \nCorps for the countless hours of technical assistance and support as \nthis bill was developed.\n  In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Capito and me \nin supporting this excellent bill because every State stands to benefit \nfrom the legislation before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the bill, as amended, is considered read a \nthird time.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (S. 5016) to designate the medical center of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs located in Anchorage, Alaska, as the ``Colonel Mary \nLouise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System'', and for \nother purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 5016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson \n     Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System Act of 2022''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Mary Louise (Milligan) Rasmuson was born April 11, \n     1911, in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n       (2) Mary Louise received a Bachelor of Science degree from \n     the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a Master of \n     Education degree from the University of Pittsburgh.\n       (3) Mary Louise was one of the first two women to receive \n     an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from the Carnegie \n     Institute of Technology.\n       (4) In 1942, Mary Louise joined the Women's Army Auxiliary \n     Corps as a Private and was in the first graduating class.\n       (5) Mary Louise worked up the ranks, and in 1957, President \n     Dwight Eisenhower appointed Mary Louise as the Fifth Director \n     of the Women's Army Corps and she was reappointed to this \n     position by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.\n       (6) In 1962, Colonel Rasmuson retired from the Army.\n       (7) Colonel Rasmuson was recognized for her outstanding \n     service in the Women's Army Corps with the Legion of Merit \n     award with two Oak Leaf Clusters for her work in expanding \n     the roles and duties of women in the Army, as well as her \n     role in integrating Black women in the Women's Army Corps.\n       (8) Colonel Rasmuson became Director of the Women's Army \n     Corps during tumultuous times and is credited with enhancing \n     the image and recruitment of women into the Women's Army \n     Corps during her years as the Director.\n       (9) Colonel Rasmuson expanded opportunities for women to \n     serve in assignments previously reserved only for men, \n     starting with the assignments of 12 enlisted women into the \n     First Missile Master Unit at Fort Meade, Maryland.\n       (10) Colonel Rasmuson was instrumental in enabling women to \n     be promoted above the grade of E-7 into the highest enlisted \n     ranks of the Army, E-8 and E-9.\n       (11) During her time in the Women's Army Corps, Colonel \n     Rasmuson was the guiding force behind the Army opening up the \n     college enlistment option to women under the self-enhancement \n     programs and witnessed the first female enlisted member \n     attend college under those programs.\n       (12) The career of Colonel Rasmuson also laid the \n     groundwork for women to be fully integrated into the United \n     States Army when the Women's Army Corps was disbanded in \n     1978.\n       (13) In 1961, Mary Louise married a prominent leader in \n     Alaska, Elmer E. Rasmuson, and she was the first Director of \n     the Women's Army Corps to be married while serving in that \n     position.\n       (14) After her retirement from military service in 1962, \n     Mary Louise moved to Alaska where she continued her \n     leadership as a veteran in her community in Alaska.\n       (15) Mary Louise served as First Lady of Anchorage after \n     the devastating magnitude 9.2 earthquake in 1964, after her \n     husband, Elmer, was elected as mayor, serving from 1964 to \n     1967.\n       (16) Mary Louise was an advocate of social justice, \n     education, and the arts during her 45 years of work on the \n     Board of the Rasmuson Foundation.\n       (17) Mary Louise served as the Honorary Chair and was a \n     major founder to renovate the Anchorage Veterans Memorial on \n     the Delaney Parkstrip in downtown Anchorage.\n       (18) Mary Louise also contributed to the Army Women's \n     Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the \n     National Museum of the United States Army.\n       (19) Mary Louise was the Chair of the Anchorage Museum \n     Foundation and helped establish the museum in Anchorage, \n     serving as its Chair for 21 years.\n       (20) On July 30, 2012, Mary Louise died at her home in \n     Anchorage, at the age of 101, but her legacy of character and \n     leadership will endure as an example to all who serve in the \n     United States military.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF COLONEL MARY LOUISE RASMUSON CAMPUS OF \n                   THE ALASKA VA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The medical center of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs in Anchorage, Alaska, shall, after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, be known and designated as the \n     ``Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA \n     Healthcare System''.\n       (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the Colonel Mary Louise \n     Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to insert extraneous material on S. 5016.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n\n[[Page H9960]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Colonel Mary Louise \nRasmuson, an Army veteran, a tireless advocate for women \nservicemembers, and a decades-long champion of women's and civil \nrights.\n  The bill before us, S. 5016, would appropriately name VA's medical \ncenter in Anchorage, Alaska, the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of \nthe Alaska VA Healthcare System.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for her work on this bill in the Senate, \nand my colleague, Representative Peltola, for leading this effort in \nthe House. Colonel Rasmuson was born in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, \nin 1911. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in education from the \nWomen's College at Carnegie Mellon University, and later earned a \nmaster's degree in school administration from the University of \nPittsburgh.\n  Soon after, Colonel Rasmuson became one of the first two women ever \nto receive an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree from the Carnegie \nInstitute of Technology, anticipating a long career ahead of breaking \nbarriers for women.\n  In 1942, Colonel Rasmuson enlisted in the World War II effort, \njoining the Women's Army Corps as a private. Thanks to her diligent \nservice, she quickly worked her way up through the ranks and, in 1957, \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower appointed Colonel Rasmuson as the fifth \ndirector of the Women's Army Corps.\n  In her capacity as director, she pushed for the integration of Black \nwomen into the Army, while working to change laws which denied women \npromotion opportunities and service credits. During her tenure, for the \nfirst time, women were authorized for appointments at the highest \nenlisted ranks of the Army, E-8 and E-9.\n  Colonel Rasmuson would be reappointed as director of the Women's Army \nCorps in 1961 by President Kennedy before retiring from the Army in \n1962. For her valuable service as director, she earned the prestigious \nLegion of Medal award with two Oak Leaf clusters, in recognition of her \nbrave contribution to female servicemembers.\n  In retirement, she moved to Alaska with her husband, Elmer Rasmuson, \nserving as first lady of Anchorage from 1964 to 1967 during her \nhusband's mayorship.\n  Afterward, Colonel Rasmuson served for 45 years on the board of the \nRasmuson Foundation, directing more than $200 million in grants to \nAlaskan nonprofit organizations, veterans' memorials, and educational \nservices.\n  On July 30, 2012, Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson passed away at her \nhome in Anchorage, Alaska, at the age of 101. Thanks to her lifelong \nleadership, she will always be remembered for the lasting impact she \nleft on the U.S. Army, pushing it ever-closer to gender equality.\n  Indeed, it was thanks to her impactful work as director of the \nWomen's Army Corps that, in 1978, this segregated branch of the United \nStates Army was disbanded, integrating all female and male units into \none cohesive force.\n  While the fight for gender equality for our servicemembers and \nveterans continues, Colonel Rasmuson's leadership reminds us of the \ngreat strides our country has made toward justice, freedom, and \nequality for all.\n  S. 5016 has letters of support from several veterans service \norganizations, including The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nand Disabled American Veterans.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record these letters of support.\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 2022.\n     Chairman Jon Tester\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Mark Takano\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Jerry Moran\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Mike Bost\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman \n     Takano, and Ranking Member Bost: We, the members of the \n     Alaska delegation, write to recommend renaming the Alaska \n     Veterans Affairs Healthcare System Muldoon Road Campus in \n     Anchorage, Alaska to honor the legacy of Colonel Mary Louise \n     Rasmuson.\n       Colonel Rasmuson was an exception leader throughout her \n     distinguished military career. After retiring, she continued \n     to tirelessly serve Alaska and the veteran community in many \n     remarkable ways.\n       Whereas the VA system only has three clinics named after \n     women and Alaska boasts the most veterans per capita in the \n     nation, we can find no better way to honor Colonel Rasmuson, \n     her family, and most importantly, our veterans in Alaska.\n       Renaming the center after Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson is \n     fitting and deserved recognition for such an exemplary \n     veteran and American hero. Thank you for your consideration \n     of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lisa Murkowski,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                                     Dan Sullivan,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                             Mary Sattler Peltola,\n     Representative for All Alaska.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                         Department of Alaska,\n\n                               Anchorage, Alaska, August 22, 2022.\n       To Alaska's Congressional Delegation: The American Legion, \n     Department of Alaska, fully supports the State of Alaska's \n     Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and Alaska VA \n     Medical Center's Director Mr. Thomas Steinbrunner's request \n     to rename the Alaska VA Medical Center to the Colonel Mary \n     Louise Rasmuson VA Campus.\n       Colonel Rasmuson dedicated her time and energy to her \n     military career and to her Alaska communities.

Mary Louise did so much for Alaska \n     Military and Veterans while she was alive, and even though \n     she is no longer with us, her legacy continues through a \n     trust fund that continues to bring light to our Military and \n     Veterans here in Alaska.\n       The Alaska DAV is proud to be Veterans that stands and \n     recommend this change immediately.\n                                                  Pamela F. Beale,\n                                       Commander, Metro Chapter 7.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I \nurge all my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5016, a bill to \ndesignate the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nlocated in Anchorage, Alaska, as the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson \nCampus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System.\n  Mary Louise Rasmuson was born, as was said earlier, in April 1911 in \nEast Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During World War II, she answered the \nNation's call and enlisted in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps as a \nprivate. She became one of the first women to serve in that role.\n  Having quickly risen through the ranks, President Eisenhower \nappointed Colonel Rasmuson as the Director of the Women's Army Corps.\n  Colonel Rasmuson was instrumental in the integration of Black women \ninto the Women's Army Corps and was awarded the Legion of Merit for \nleadership. At her direction, she also expanded opportunities for women \nto serve in assignments previously reserved only for men. She also \nadvocated for new avenues for women to advance their military careers.\n  After serving for over 20 years in the Army, she retired in July of \n1962 and moved to Alaska, where she continued\n\n[[Page H9961]]\n\nto serve her community as a veteran. Colonel Rasmuson engaged in \nseveral efforts to preserve the veterans' stories in museums and \nmemorials around the country until she passed away in 2012 at the age \nof 101. Now, her story of service will be told for generations.\n  Colonel Rasmuson not only paved the way for successful integration of \nwomen into what is now our U.S. Army, she also was a role model of \ncharacter and outstanding service to our Nation.\n  Naming the VA facility in Alaska in her honor is a fitting tribute.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nAlaska (Mrs. Peltola), my friend and a strong supporter of this piece \nof legislation, which is fitting as someone who has broken barriers \nherself in supporting this legislation of someone who broke barriers \nfor the U.S. military.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5016, the \nColonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System \nAct.\n  Colonel Rasmuson was an inspiration and driving force for advancing \nthe role of women in the military and engaging in critical community \nservice. Her presence was felt in every community she touched, and her \nlegacy has lived on for future generations.\n  In 1942, as the United States engaged in World War II, Mary Louise \nRasmuson wanted to serve her country and joined the Women's Army \nAuxiliary Corps. She was part of their first graduating class and laid \nthe groundwork for millions of women to come.\n  As she continued her military career, Colonel Rasmuson soared through \nthe ranks and took on multiple leadership roles in the Army. In 1957, \nshe was appointed as the fifth director of the Women's Army Corps and \nwas appointed again in 1961 by President Kennedy. Colonel Rasmuson \nretired from the Army in 1962, but her legacy and community impact \nexpanded well beyond these years.\n  Following her military retirement, Mary Louise Rasmuson moved to \nAlaska, where she was a monumental philanthropist and pivotal member of \nthe community. She secured funding for dozens of programs to support \nAlaskans, most notably for the Anchorage Museum.\n  Most importantly, Colonel Rasmuson was a strong leader for veterans, \nespecially female veterans, assisting them in securing their benefits.\n  This bill is a perfect tribute to Mary in many ways. It highlights \nher dedication to veterans in Alaska, philanthropic work, and deep \ncommitment to improving the lives of all Alaskans.\n  This bill would designate the Department of Veterans Affairs medical \ncenter in Anchorage as the Colonel Mary Louise Rasmuson Campus of the \nAlaska VA Healthcare System, a fitting tribute to a woman who gave so \nmuch to the veterans of Alaska.\n  I thank Chairman Takano, Ranking Member Bost, and leadership on both \nsides for scheduling this bill. I also thank Senators Murkowski and \nSullivan for sponsoring and securing its passage in the Senate.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill, as everyone has spoken about how this needs to be, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO.

Madam President, when the Senate considers complex and \nprofound issues of public policy, I am particularly reminded of the \nwisdom of our late friend, Mr. Mike Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming. Not \nlong after I came to the Senate, I noticed how productive that Senator \nEnzi, one of the most conservative Members of the Senate, was working \non the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee with Teddy \nKennedy, the ``liberal lion of the Senate.'' You had one of the most \nconservative Members of the Senate working with one of the most liberal \nMembers of the Senate. But, amazingly, to me, they seemed to get a lot \ndone.\n  So I asked Senator Enzi, I said: How is it that you, a staunch \nconservative, could work so productively with somebody with such \ndifferent views? Senator Enzi told me: It is easy. I call it the 80-20 \nrule.\n  Well, the fact of life is we are not going to agree with everybody \n100 percent of the time. And I sometimes say I don't agree with my wife \n100 percent of the time, but she is always right.\n  But, seriously, if we are going to get things done here in the U.S. \nSenate for the benefit of the American people, we have to understand \nnobody is going to get everything they want. And I think for purposes \nof simplicity, an illustration of Senator Enzi's comments about the 80-\n20 rule are very helpful.\n  I have tried to employ that strategy many times since those days, and \nI hope we can apply that wisdom and strategy again dealing with this \nrecent string of shootings, including Uvalde, TX.\n  Now this debate evokes strong emotions and strong opinions from \npeople across the political spectrum, and it is an understatement to \nsay that there are serious differences of opinion.\n  I start with the premise that I took an oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution of the United States, and I\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nhave no intention of violating that oath. That is where I start. Part \nof the Constitution is the amendments, including the first 10 which are \nthe Bill of Rights that includes the Second Amendment, which provides a \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms for law-abiding Americans. I \nhave no intention of violating my oath, and I have no intention of \nundermining the rights of law-abiding gun owners in America because it \nis a constitutional right.\n  It is no secret that when it comes to the culture in America, there \nare very different views ranging from, let's say, Connecticut, where \nSenator Murphy comes from, to places like Texas, where guns are \ncommonplace but people know how to use them and they use them \nresponsibly and they are not a threat to public safety.\n  There are those who would like to restrict the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners because that is their view--they strongly hold that view, \nbut I have been clear that is a nonstarter for me.\n  But to Senator Enzi's wise advice, rather than focus on the 20 \npercent we can't agree on, I have been trying to explore common ground \nwith our colleagues on a bipartisan basis. These were devastating \ntragedies. We all agree with that. We all agree that no child should \never fear for his or her safety while sitting in a classroom.\n  I think we even all agree that there is a mental health epidemic in \nAmerica today, and that is a piece of the puzzle. To me the shootings \nare a symptom of a larger problem, which is the failure of our mental \nhealth system in America, and it manifests itself in many different \nways. Now, people suffering from mental health challenges, by and \nlarge, they are not violent, but a subset of them threaten their own \nlives with suicide. Some of them, even a subset of others, not only \ncommit suicide by attacking a known armed police contingent, but they \nalso engage in homicides, too, which is what happened with Salvador \nRamos in Uvalde, TX.\n\n  I think there is a consensus in America that criminals and people \nexperiencing severe mental health crises should not have access to \nguns. It is not just my opinion; it is actually the law. That is what \nthe National Instant Criminal Background Check System is supposed to \nvet for--to make sure that people who have criminal records, people who \nhave been institutionalized for mental health problems, people who are \ndishonorably discharged, people who are under a protective order, \npeople who have committed felonies, people who have committed domestic \nviolence, those are all people who now, if you went to buy a firearm \nand underwent a national instant criminal background check, you would \nnot be able to legally purchase or possess a firearm because that is \nthe law of the land and has been a long time.\n  With that in mind, Senator Murphy from Connecticut, Senator Tillis \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Sinema from Arizona, and I have been \nlooking at these various factors and tried to come up with a targeted \nbill that might have prevented some of these tragedies. To me, that is \nthe best way to look at this, is to say: If this had been in place, is \nit less likely that this tragedy would have occurred? Stated another \nway, If we do this, is there a chance or a probability that we could \nsave lives in the future? To me, that should be our focus.\n  Instead of wasting time talking about what we don't agree on, I think \nit is productive for us to focus on this subset of issues where I \nbelieve there is room for a consensus because, of course, that is the \nonly way to make progress and to get a result.\n  When the Constitution was written, it created three branches of \ngovernment; but in particular, the legislative and the executive \nbranch, with two branches of the Congress. They are very different in \ntheir nature. They made it difficult to pass legislation. It is hard. \nWe do it, but it is hard. And it is hard because it takes consensus, \nand consensus sometimes takes time, particularly on issues that evoke \nsuch strong views and opinions and reflect, frankly, the diversity of \nthis country.\n  I am glad to say, on this topic, we are making steady progress. It is \nearly in the process, but I am optimistic where things stand right now. \nWhat am I optimistic about? I am optimistic that we could pass a bill \nin the Senate, it can pass the House, and it will get a signature by \nPresident Biden. It will become law of the land.\n  What is the test of that legislation? It is, to me, not whether it \nmeets your ideological standard of what the bill should look like, but \nit is simply this: Will it save lives? If it will, it is worth all of \nour best efforts.\n  As I said, there is broad agreement about the mental health \nchallenges, not only in our schools, but in our society at large and \nhow that manifests itself. Sixty percent of the gun deaths in America \nare suicides. Don't we want to try to prevent those suicides? I think \nso. That is why the mental health issue is so important, among other \nreasons. And then, obviously, the school safety issues. We need to try \nto figure out ways to make our schools harder to get into for people \nlike Salvador Ramos.\n  Unfortunately, the mental health challenges of young, disaffected, \nand alienated boys is a profile that is all too familiar. It is \nreflected in the shooter in Uvalde. It is reflected in the shooter in \nSandy Hook, Adam Lanza. They came from much different places in terms \nof their socioeconomics, but in terms of their alienation and their \ndeveloping mental illness and their willingness to not only take their \nown life but other people's lives, unfortunately, it paints an eerily \nsimilar picture.\n  The shooter in Uvalde was isolated and bullied at school. He had a \nrecord of cutting his face--self-mutilation--and abusing and torturing \nanimals, and he was known for fighting and threatening his fellow \nstudents with everything from assault to rape. He was a ticking time \nbomb, and many people--not all the people but many people in this small \ncommunity of 15,000 people knew it. Certainly, his mother knew it. \nUnfortunately, his mother was a drug user, and he was living with his \ngrandmother. But this is a young man who shot his own grandmother \nbecause she wanted him to go back to school because, of course, he had \nbeen out of the classroom because of COVID-19 restrictions. Frankly, \nthat isolation just made his mental illness that much worse.\n  As I said, the shooter at Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza, experienced what \nwas later described as ``severe and deteriorating'' mental health \nproblems that went untreated, not because his parents didn't try--they \ndid--but when he was prescribed medication to help him manage his \nmental illness, he refused to take it, and his mom finally gave up, \nexhausted, as you can imagine. It was a period of 3 years that he \ndidn't see any mental health provider at all, sitting in his room, \nplaying video games, killing people online virtually, becoming \nincreasingly desensitized, and spiraling down that psychiatric, \npsychological, and emotional drain.\n  We need to equip all of our young people in America with the \nresources and the assistance they need in order to manage their \nemotional and mental health struggles. I think that is part of what we \nneed to do.\n  School security, as I said, was also a glaring issue at Uvalde. The \nshooter was able to enter Robb Elementary School through a door that \nwasn't even locked. That is a problem. School districts need to be \nprepared for the worst-case scenario. They need to prepare for the \nworst and hope for the best. That means evaluating physical security, \nreviewing current protocols, developing best practices, and potentially \nadding or expanding the number of school resource officers. Those are \nlaw enforcement officers on campus.\n  I think there is a lot of common ground on things we can agree on \nhere--safer schools, better mental health resources, and coming up with \nadditional assistance that will harden our schools and provide greater \ndeterrence and protections for our students.\n  The Senators whom I have been talking to--including the group of four \nbut even the larger group today at noon--we have been talking about \nother things we might do to keep individuals who are already prohibited \nby law because they have a criminal background or they have mental \nhealth adjudications and problems.\n  How do we keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those who are \nundergoing mental health crises? That is an area of common ground. This \nis not about creating new restrictions on\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nlaw-abiding citizens; it is about ensuring the system we already have \nin place works as intended.\n  One idea we have discussed is, because this young man in Uvalde \nturned 18 and because there was no look back at his juvenile record, he \npassed a background check. It is as if he was born on his 18th birthday \nand nothing that happened before was important. That is obviously a \nproblem. So we are looking at taking steps to encourage States to \nupload juvenile records into the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System. This is standard practice in some but not most States, \nand it is easy to see why it is important. If we are uploading \ninformation about adults' mental health adjudications but we don't have \naccess to juveniles' mental health adjudications, to me, that is a \nproblem. If a 17-year-old, for example, is convicted of aggravated \nassault, the record should show up in his background check if he tries \nto purchase a gun when he turns 18.\n  I think this is a commonsense way to make sure the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check databases are complete and they are accurate. \nThat is not about expanding the system; that is about making sure the \nsystem we have actually works.\n  I want to make sure that we are committed to providing due process \nprotections for citizens in all circumstances. Again, this is part of \nour Constitution, due process of law--the right to appear, the right to \ncontest a decision by the government and to produce evidence and to \ncross-examine witnesses. That is an essential aspect of due process. \nWhen you talk about depriving somebody of a constitutional right, it is \neven more important.\n  The goal here is to make a law; it is not to make a political \nstatement. As I said, I am encouraged by the progress we are making, \nbut I don't think artificial deadlines are useful. The majority leader, \nSenator Schumer, has threatened to schedule votes if an agreement isn't \nreached by a certain time. I don't think that is particularly helpful.\n  Again, my goal and I think most Senators' goal here is to come up \nwith a bill that can pass; otherwise, we might as well move on to other \ntopics. But I sense a feeling of urgency and a desire to actually get \nthings done. Around here, if you know people have the will, there is a \nway, and I believe there is a collective bipartisan will. So far, \neverybody, I believe, has been working in good faith. We all understand \nthe differences that we have regionally and culturally when it comes to \nthings like the Second Amendment. We understand the different politics \nin different States. That is the genius of the Senate that brings us \nall together. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it possible for us \nto try to find some common ground.\n  The most common cry you hear today when it comes to incidents like \nUvalde is to do something. I think we agree with that, but what that \nsomething is is not easy, but it is important, and we need to try. \nAgain, I am optimistic because of the progress we have made so far that \nwe will do something here that is important that will save lives. To \nme, that is the goal. And I think all 100 Senators would agree, if we \ncan achieve that goal, then our efforts will have been worthwhile.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hickenlooper). The clerk will call roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-06-22"}

Mr. President, 28 days ago, an 18-year-old young man \nopened fire on students at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX. He \nmurdered 21 people--19 children and 2 teachers. In the process, he \neffectively committed suicide as well.\n  This was an attack that was so cruel, so brutal, and inhumane that it \nhas brought much of our Nation to its knees in mourning. Since the \nshooting, my office has received--as I am sure many other Members of \nCongress have--I have received tens of thousands of calls and letters \nand emails with a singular message: Do something.\n  Do something. Not do nothing, but do something. Texans are disgusted \nand outraged by what happened at Robb Elementary, and they want \nCongress to take appropriate action to prevent the loss of more \ninnocent lives.\n  I don't want us to pass a bill for the purpose of checking a box. I \nwant to make sure we actually do something useful, something that is \ncapable of becoming a law, something that will have the potential to \nsave lives.\n  I am happy to report as a result of the hard work of a number of \nSenators in this Chamber that we have made some serious progress. In \nparticular, over the last few weeks, Mr. Murphy, the Senator from \nConnecticut; Ms. Sinema, the Senator from Arizona; Mr. Tillis, the \nSenator from North Carolina; and I have searched high and low for \ncommon ground.\n  Now, there are some people who would say, What is the use? Why try? \nWe know this is an issue that divides much of the country, depending on \nwhere you live, and maybe even divides people living in the same \nhousehold. But I think we have found some areas where there is space \nfor compromise. And we have also found that there are some redlines and \nno middle ground. We have talked; we have debated; we have disagreed; \nand, finally, we have reached an agreement among the four of us. But, \nobviously, this is not something that will become law or fail to become \nlaw because of a small group of Senators.\n  The truth is we had a larger group of 20 Senators--10 Republicans and \n10 Democrats--come forward and sign on to an agreed set of principles, \nand I believe as Senators see the text that supports those principles, \nthey will see we have tried our best to be true as to what we said \nthose agreed principles should be.\n  So soon, very soon--not soon enough for me--but very soon, we will \nsee the text of bipartisan legislation that will help keep our children \nand our communities safer.\n  We know there is no such thing as a perfect piece of legislation. We \nare imperfect human beings. But we have to try, and I believe this bill \nis a step in the right direction.\n  One of the pillars of this legislation is support for community-based \nmental health care. Following the violent attacks, we have all heard \nabout missed signs, and the fact is the New York Times recently \nprofiled the type of young man: typically alienated, isolated, not \nreceiving any sort of support or medical or psychiatric care, certainly \nnot complying with their doctors' orders when it comes to taking their \nmedication that allows them to manage their mental illness challenges.\n  We know that this profile is one that Salvador Ramos fit, the shooter \nin Uvalde. He was a deeply troubled young man. He was isolated. He was \nbullied in school. He cut himself because he said he liked the way it \nmade him look. It made him look tough. He had a history of fighting, of \nassaulting fellow students, of threatening sexual assault of young \nwomen, and torturing and killing animals. It is a familiar profile.\n  This man, this young man, I think was crying out for help. But he got \nno help, notwithstanding the best efforts of people around him. He shot \nhis own grandmother before he went to Robb Elementary School because \nshe wanted\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nhim to go back to the classroom after being out of the classroom for 2 \nyears because of COVID mitigation practices.\n  So our goal with this legislation is to try to help people in crisis \nget treatment before they reach a point like Salvador Ramos.\n  Now, I want to be clear: Not everybody who is suffering a mental \nhealth crisis is a threat to themselves and others. Matter of fact, the \nopposite is true. Many people suffer in silence with their parents, \ntheir families, their siblings, trying to help them to no avail. But \nthere is a small subset of people like Salvador Ramos who are a danger \nto themselves and others if they don't get the kind of help they need.\n  So the provision of the bill which represents the single largest \ninvestment in community-based mental health treatment in American \nhistory is drawn from bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator \nStabenow and Senator Blunt. I think there are eight demonstration \nprojects around the country. We want to make this kind of access to \ncommunity-based mental health care available all across the country, \nand our bill will help to do that.\n  It expands high-quality mental health and addiction services \nnationwide through the expansion of certified community behavioral \nhealth clinics.\n  Many of these providers already operate in communities across the \ncountry, but our legislation expands the networks of clinics to deliver \neven stronger and more fulsome support to our communities.\n  We also include provisions to expand support of care in our schools \nbecause it is at school that many of our young people will be \nidentified as needing support.\n  Teachers actually spend more time than parents, typically, with our \nschool-aged children; and the supported services that will be part of \nthis bill will help identify students that need that help so that \nintervention can come as early as possible.\n  As the Presiding Officer probably knows, 60 percent of gun deaths in \nAmerica are suicides--suicides. We not only want to try our best to do \nthings that will hopefully stop the Salvador Ramoses in the future from \nhurting other people, we want to try to help them and keep them from \nhurting themselves as well.\n  So I believe this huge investment in America's mental health delivery \nsystem is an investment in safer and healthier communities.\n  Another pillar of the legislation is school safety. The Uvalde \nshooter was able to enter Robb Elementary School through a door that \nwas not locked when it should have been. That is an obvious \nvulnerability. Schools need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario, \nwhich means evaluating physical security measures, reviewing current \nprotocol, adopting best practices, which are broadly available through \npublications and studies by the Secret Service and other law \nenforcement agencies. And they also need to be able to add or expand \nthe number of school resource officers as appropriate.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again: No parent should have \nto send their child to school fearful for their child's safety, and no \nchild should have to go to school and be afraid for their safety.\n  All of our students and teachers and the administrators and others in \nour schools deserve to feel safe, and parents deserve peace of mind, \nand that is what I hope these additional resources will provide.\n  Now, the final range portion of this bill beyond mental health and \nschool safety involves a range of provisions to prevent these sort of \nviolent attacks from occurring in the future.\n  Again, I believe that law-abiding citizens are not the problem. I \ndon't believe law-abiding citizens are a threat to public health, and \nthis bill honors that commitment.\n  So unless a person is convicted of a crime or is adjudicated mentally \nill, their ability to purchase a firearm will not be impacted by this \nlegislation.\n  Now, some have suggested provisions that I believe would infringe on \nSecond Amendment rights and really not get to the root of the problem.\n  For example, there is no particular ban on a type of gun or no \nmandatory waiting periods, no background checks of intrafamily or \nfriend-to-friend transfer, none of these are included in the \nlegislation. And some of our colleagues clearly would like to see that. \nBut, again, that is because law-abiding gun owners are not the problem.\n  What we are trying to do is prevent dangerous individuals from \nunleashing violence on their communities. And one way of achieving that \ngoal is through more robust crisis intervention programs.\n  Now, that is a broad term that describes a range of initiatives that \naim to reduce violence, protect the public, and connect individuals in \ncrisis with the help they need.\n\n  It could include something called assisted outpatient treatment, \nwhich allows courts to order people with mental health challenges to \nreceive outpatient treatment to ensure they receive the care they \nneeded, and the court will hold them accountable to make sure they make \nthe doctors' appointments and take the medications they need in order \nto remain productive.\n  But beyond AOTs--or assisted outpatient treatment--there are very \neffective regimes like mental health courts, like I saw in Dallas, TX, \nnot that long ago.\n  Now, one of the things that encourages compliance is the fact that \nyou have a judge, somebody wearing a black robe, saying: You will do \nthis. And if that is what it takes, that is fine with me. But there are \nalso drug courts, veterans' courts, and the like which aim to treat the \nroot cause, not the symptom. And across the country, there are hundreds \nof mental health and veterans' treatment courts and thousands of drug \ncourt programs that have delivered incredible results.\n  I have been clear at the outset that I am interested in providing law \nenforcement-related grants to all 50 States to put forward a range of \ncrisis intervention programs that the State deems best to help reduce \nsuicide and violence.\n  Now, some of our colleagues wanted to focus this money solely on the \n19 States that have passed some form of red flag law, and, frankly, \nthat is a choice that is up to the State. But we are not introducing a \nnational red flag law, but we are providing the availability of law \nenforcement-related grants to crisis intervention programs, whether you \nadopted a red flag program or not. Perhaps you have chosen something \ndifferent. Well, this grant program will get every State funding that \nimplements programs that they themselves have adopted to stop \nindividuals in crisis from reaching the point of violence or self-harm.\n  If any State wants to pass a law, obviously, under our Constitution, \nthey have plenary authority to pass whatever crisis intervention laws \nthey choose to do so. But one of the things that we have agreed upon is \nthey have to have robust due process protections because we are talking \nabout a constitutional right.\n  So if the new law does not include due process protections, it will \nnot be eligible for these grants, no matter what form that crisis \nintervention program takes.\n  Our bill also provides increased protection for domestic violence \nvictims. It shouldn't matter whether a person is married to their \nabuser, if the abuser is convicted of domestic violence, and many \npeople have what I would call nontraditional relationships, whether \nthey are living together, they have a child together, or whether they \njust have a long-term romantic or intimate relationship. Eighty-six \npercent of gun-owning households support that sort of protection for \ndomestic violence victims, where, too often, a gun is involved.\n  Again, this doesn't limit law-abiding gun owners' rights unless \nsomebody is convicted of domestic abuse under their State laws. Their \ngun rights will not be impacted.\n  Again, this portion of the bill includes critical due process \nprotections which, as we all know, is part of our Constitution. You \nshall not be deprived of your rights without due process of law.\n  One new feature that we proposed is that those who are convicted of \nnonspousal misdemeanor domestic abuse--not felony but misdemeanor \ndomestic violence--will have an opportunity after 5 years to have their \nSecond Amendment rights restored, but they have to have a clean record. \nAnd this is an incentive, in fact, I think, for people\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\nwho have made a mistake and have committed domestic violence and \nreceived a misdemeanor conviction to straighten up their act and to not \nrepeat it.\n  Our bill also strengthens the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System, known as NICS, to ensure it is more fulsome and accurate.\n  In Uvalde, this young man, Salvador Ramos, turned 18. He went in and \npassed a background check. It is like he was born yesterday because \nthere was no way for the National Instant Criminal Background checks \nsystem to look back on any mental health adjudications or criminal \nconvictions, which would have barred him from purchasing a firearm had \nit occurred as an adult.\n  If a 17-year-old is convicted of a violent crime or adjudicated as \nmentally incompetent, that information should show up in the background \ncheck system if he tries to purchase a firearm when he turns 18.\n  Eighty-seven percent of gun-owning households in America support \nmaking juvenile records available in the background check system, and \nthis legislation will make that possible.\n  Now, the States will control what information they are willing to \nshare, but our legislation provides an incentive for States to upload \nthe records that reflect on the suitability of an individual to \npurchase a firearm, allow them to upload juvenile records into the \nNational Instant Criminal Background System to ensure that firearms are \nnot falling into the hands of those under 21 who would be prohibited \nfrom purchasing that gun if they were an adult when it happened.\n  So I know this bill is not going to please everyone. Some think it \ngoes too far; others think it doesn't go far enough, and I get it. But \nthe nature of compromise and the nature of actually wanting to get a \nresult requires that everybody try to find common ground where we can, \nand that is particularly hard in a 50-50 U.S. Senate.\n  But I believe the same people who are telling us to do something are \nsending us a clear message to do what we can to keep our children and \ncommunities safe. I am confident this legislation moves us in a \npositive direction.\n  I want to thank all of our colleagues who have worked so hard in this \nprocess that has gotten us this far. My understanding is that the text \nwill be released essentially at any moment, although the principles \nupon which that text is written have been public for quite a while now.\n  This legislation is the product of good-faith, bipartisan \nnegotiations. It includes bills and ideas offered by colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, and it makes changes that are supported by vast \nmajorities of Americans. And I think, most importantly, it has the real \npotential to become a law and to create real changes in communities \nacross this country--safer, healthier communities; stronger, more \nsecure schools; saving lives. That is what we are all about.\n  So I am eager to discuss more details with our colleagues as they \nreview the text in the coming days, and I hope we can continue to show \nthe same sort of good faith and the openness to other ideas that have \nbrought us to this point as we debate and we vote on this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-06-22"}

Madam President, I rise to express the urgent need to \npass the Women's Health Protection Act and put an end to the constant \nattacks that have chipped away at women's constitutional rights in this \ncountry. Now more than ever, it is vital to codify reproductive rights \nand protect other hard-won civil rights as they face renewed threats.\n  Last week, POLITICO published Supreme Court Associate Justice Alito's\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\ndraft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, which, while not \nfinal, would strike down Roe v. Wade. This would have an immediate and \ndevastating consequence for the health and well-being of tens of \nmillions of women of reproductive age across the Nation. Women in low-\nincome families who could not overcome the financial and logical \nbarriers to travel to States with abortion access will suffer the most, \nincreasing existing health disparities.\n  While this draft opinion is a reminder of what is at stake, we have \nseen the erosion of reproductive rights for decades. Despite the clear \nconstitutional rights the Supreme Court established almost 50 years ago \nin the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, each year, legislatures across \nthe country have passed harmful abortion restrictions in an effort to \nimpede a woman's fundamental right to make the best informed healthcare \ndecisions for herself and her family. This goes against what I believe \nto be one of the fundamental responsibilities of the Court, which is to \nexpand rights, not restrict them.\n  Implementing the Bill of Rights, we have seen the Federal courts over \na period of time protect Americans against the abuse of power, \nincluding the power exercised by our government. Should this opinion go \ninto effect, this would be the first time in memory that the Court \nwould act to take away the constitutional rights of Americans. It would \nalso be the first time in our country's history when women now would \nhave fewer rights than their mothers.\n  The reasoning used in this draft decision could also be used to \nundermine other dearly held civil rights in the future. Justice Alito's \nleaked draft opinion laid out a roadmap to overturn other landmark \ndecisions that expanded rights, including Obergefell v. Hodges, which \naffirmed marriage equality.\n  Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all testified under oath \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court precedents \nshould stand--a bedrock principle of jurisprudence known as stare \ndecisis--but they clearly arrived with an agenda to overturn Roe, and \nnow, they are making that a reality.\n  Senate Republicans and former President Donald Trump bear \nresponsibility for nominating and confirming Justices far outside of \nthe legal mainstream and damaging our confirmation process and the \npublic's faith in the Supreme Court as an impartial arbiter of our \nNation's laws.\n  Senate Republicans deliberately stole the seat that President Barack \nObama nominated Merrick Garland to fill, and they delayed even having a \nhearing for 1 year, effectively shrinking the size of the Supreme \nCourt. Senate Republicans then turned around and rushed the \nconfirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett after the death of Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg, even though early voting had already begun in the \n2020 Presidential elections.\n  Overturning Roe goes against public opinion. A recent poll of the \nWashington Post-ABC showed that 70 percent of Americans believe that \nthe Court should uphold Roe and that decisions regarding abortion \nshould be left to a woman and her doctor.\n  Now more than ever, it is essential for the Senate to pass the \nWomen's Health Protection Act, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. \nThe legislation would protect the right to abortion free from medically \nunnecessary restrictions and create a statutory right for providers to \nprovide and patients to receive care. This would codify Roe v. Wade and \nprevent States from continuing to enact restrictions on reproductive \nfreedoms.\n  Despite the opinion just being a draft and abortion still being a \nconstitutional right, States are already seizing on the momentum of \nthis draft opinion and moving to limit a woman's constitutional right. \nSince the leak of this draft opinion, legislatures around the country \nare rushing to criminalize abortion and outlaw contraception.\n  Just last week, the Louisiana State Legislature advanced a bill that \nwould classify abortion as homicide. This adds to the over half of our \nStates that have already passed laws to restrict and ban abortion \naccess. There are more than one dozen States with anti-abortion laws \nset to take effect immediately if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. \nWade.\n  The Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, stated:\n\n       If the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative \n     bodies--not only at the state level but at the federal \n     level--certainly could legislate in that area.\n\n  Thanks to five unelected, activist Justices on the Supreme Court, \nwomen are facing the prospect of a Federal, nationwide ban on abortion \nservices. We go back to those days where abortions were performed \nillegally in back alleys. We can't let that happen in this country.\n  While many States, including my home State of Maryland, have acted to \nexpand abortion care, we cannot rely on a patchwork of State laws to \nprotect a basic constitutional right. The right to choose is \nfundamental and a decision that a woman should make in consultation \nwith a doctor or other healthcare provider free of political \ninterference from Federal, State, or local government.\n  I urge President Biden and the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Department of Justice, and other Federal Agencies to use \ntheir power and to act swiftly to safeguard the reproductive rights of \nAmericans.\n  There is no denying that this is a bleak moment. We know the battle \nfor reproductive rights has been an ongoing struggle with previous \nsetbacks. We saw this just a few months ago following the anti-choice, \npro-vigilante law that the Texas Legislature passed which threatens \nproviders with jail time and fines for administering what is still \nfederally and constitutionally protected medical care for women.\n  We cannot wait any longer. We must do everything in our power to \nensure access to reproductive services now. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and we will have \na chance to do that starting tomorrow.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast supporter of \nreproductive rights, and this will not change. Regardless of the \noutcome of tomorrow's vote or the Supreme Court's final decision, I \nwill continue to do everything within my power to ensure that women can \nhave access to the care they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I also rise to speak about the need to \npass the Women's Health Protection Act. Certainly, the Senator from \nMaryland outlined a very strong argument as to why this fundamental \nprotection, this fundamental right, needs to be protected.\n  We know right now that we may see the Supreme Court come out with a \ndecision to basically end Roe v. Wade and, in the process, end a \nfundamental right that women in this country have had available to them \nfor 50 years.\n  We can hear all the arguments--and my colleagues will present an \nawful lot of arguments tonight and tomorrow--as to why we need to pass \nthis act, but for me, this is personal, a personal experience that I \nhad, and it is an experience that, unfortunately, many, many families \nhave had. The fact is, as I have shared this story, I have been really \noverwhelmed by people reaching out to me and saying that they, too, \nhave a very similar story and how my talking about it brought out their \nwillingness to share their experience as well. In addition to that, \nthey understand how important it is that we protect Roe v. Wade and we \nprotect the right for women to make critical decisions for themselves, \nalong with their doctor, and not have politics interfere with those \ndecisions.\n  My story involves my first wife. When we were married, she was \npregnant with a child whom we very much wanted. We were looking forward \nto having a second child. In the fourth month, towards the end of the \nfourth month, her water broke--clearly a very dangerous situation.\n  She went to go see her physician. Her physician examined her and \nsaid: With this water breaking, the amniotic fluid has now left the \nuterus. There is no way a baby can survive in this situation.\n  They examined her. There was a very faint heartbeat.\n  He said: There is a faint heartbeat here, but there is no way this \nbaby can survive.\n  He said: What I think will happen is you are going to have a \nmiscarriage. So\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\ngo home tonight, and you will have a miscarriage, and come in and see \nme tomorrow.\n  Well, you can imagine the anguish, the horrible evening, and the \ndespair that she was in and I was in. It was a long, long night.\n  The next morning, nothing happened. She went back to the physician--\nwe went back to the physician. He examined her again and said: I am \nreally surprised. I don't know why you didn't miscarry because it is \nclear that there is no way this baby can survive in this situation. The \namniotic fluid is gone; the cushion is gone.\n  He said: I don't think I can do anything because there is still a \nfaint heartbeat here. I don't know why there is still a faint \nheartbeat. So go home again tonight. I think tonight is going to be the \nnight you have a miscarriage.\n  We went back again. It didn't happen--another horrible night--\nhorrible. The mental anguish is intense, and families who have gone \nthrough this know exactly what I am talking about.\n\n  We went the next day, and, again, he examined her. He said: I can't \nunderstand this, but this is going on. I am really worried that there \nis going to be an infection here. There isn't the protection there. You \ncould go into septic shock. Your health is definitely endangered here. \nThe baby can't survive. Without the amniotic fluid, the cushion, the \nbaby could lose its limbs.\n  There were horrible, horrible, nightmarish kinds of thoughts in our \nminds.\n  He said: I am going to go to the hospital, and I am going to say, \neven though there is a faint heartbeat, this is a medical necessity, \nthat we have to do a D&C abortion here to protect your health and \npotentially your life if we don't take care of this. So I will go to \nthe hospital. Go home, and I will call you and let you know when I can \nbring you in.\n  Well, he called. I will never forget the voicemail that was left. He \nsaid: I am really sorry to say this. I went to the hospital board. I \nexplained the medical necessity here, what you are going through, how \nwe have to take care of this because it could clearly be a serious \nsituation if you go into septic shock.\n  And the board said: No. As long as there is a faint heartbeat, you \ncan't perform the procedure.\n  Then he said: There is no reason for this decision from the hospital \nboard. It is not based on sound medicine. It is not based on medical \npractice. It is not based on what is best for your health. This is \nbased on politics. Plain and simple, this is politics.\n  He goes: I am ashamed that this happened, and I am embarrassed I have \nto call you and tell you I can't do it because the hospital will not \ngrant me privileges to do it.\n  He said: My advice to you is find a doctor now, immediately, that can \ntake care of this procedure.\n  Well, you can imagine how scary that is, how frightening that is; and \nwho do we call in that situation? We were fortunate in the fact that we \nhad a friend who was a hospital administrator at another hospital. He \ngot us in to see the gynecologist, OB-GYN at the hospital to examine \nher. We went there.\n  He examined her and said: Oh, my gosh, I have to do this procedure \nnow. There is no more time. This is getting incredibly dangerous. We \nhave to do the D&C abortion.\n  He said: You are about to go--the infection is starting. It is going \nto get worse. If I don't do this quickly, you are going to lose your \nuterus. If we don't deal with it quickly, you could very well lose your \nlife with the infection that could occur here.\n  He immediately performed the procedure.\n  Just think of that. One, if we didn't have the opportunity to see \nanother doctor who was able to perform it and understood the severity \nof it, my wife at the time, former wife, could have easily lost a \nuterus, could have had significant health impacts, and could have lost \nher life.\n  It just kept ringing in my mind what that doctor said: This is about \npolitics. This is not about good medical practice. This is not about \ncaring about someone's health and caring about their life; it was about \npolitics. And that is why we have to protect Roe v. Wade.\n  We have to protect the right for women to control their bodies, to \ncontrol their reproductive health. It cannot be a decision made by \npoliticians here in this body or other places. This is a real situation \nthat families face. As I mentioned, there was an outpouring of folks \nwho have come to me who had similar situations.\n  I think about Michigan right now. Michigan has a law on the books \nthat was written in 1931 that says all abortion is prohibited in our \nState. It doesn't matter whether or not it involves the health of the \nmother, it doesn't matter if it is the life of the mother, it doesn't \nmatter if a woman is the victim of rape or incest--it is just simply \nnot allowed. I think that is unconscionable. That is what will happen. \nIt is a real-life situation that could happen if the Court decides to \ngo forward and reverse Roe v. Wade. Situations like what my former wife \nwent through and families all across America would not be able to have \nthat kind of option.\n  If you think about the no exception for rape or incest, you will have \na 17-year-old girl in Michigan who is raped. She will have no options. \nI know a majority of people in the United States believe that is \nunacceptable. I know a majority of people in the United States believe \nthat women have the right to make these most personal, these most \nintimate decisions themselves, with the advice of their physician or \nwhoever else that they want to consult.\n  This is not about politics. This is not about the opinions of folks \nwho think that they know better. Let's preserve the right of women to \ndo what they think is best.\n  That is why we have to pass the Women's Health Protection Act and why \nI would urge all my colleagues to search their heart and listen to the \nstories that people will tell them and understand that the right thing \nto do is to protect reproductive freedoms and rights in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, first, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Michigan, for coming to the floor to share \nhis own powerful and personal story and the stories of his constituents \nabout why so many of us are here on the Senate floor this evening, and \nit is because 8 days ago, our country received a terrible wake-up call. \nA leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States \nindicated that a majority of five Justices may be on the verge of \noverturning the constitutional protections of reproductive freedom set \nforth in Roe v. Wade.\n  We don't know if this draft opinion will be the final decision, but \nwe do know there is a very high chance that the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States will soon blow up 50 years of precedent and strip women \nof their constitutional right to make choices about their own body and \ntheir own self-determination.\n  And while the content of this opinion is shocking, it is not totally \nsurprising. This is the premeditated outcome of years--years--of \nplotting and planning by the rightwing legal movement and the \nRepublican Party.\n  Candidate Donald Trump promised the Nation he would handpick Justices \nwho would overturn Roe v. Wade. On the campaign trail, he even claimed \nthat Roe would be overturned ``immediately'' once he assumed office. \nAnd he stated on national television that women who receive abortions \nshould be punished. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans made up \ntheir own rules and then broke their own rules in order to play their \npart in this scheme.\n  First, Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, on the grounds that it \nwas a Presidential election year.\n  Four years later, Senate Republicans rushed through one of President \nTrump's own Supreme Court nominees just weeks before the 2020 election.\n  And in between, Senate Republicans carved out an exception to the \nSenate filibuster rule so they could push through all three of Trump's \nanti-choice Supreme Court picks: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy \nConey Barrett.\n  Each of these nominees raised their right hand before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and swore under oath that they respected the weight \nof judicial precedent. In fact, when Brett Kavanaugh was asked about \nRoe v.\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nWade, he pointed to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which affirmed the \ncore holding in Roe establishing a constitutional right to abortion, \nand he called the decision in Casey ``precedent on precedent,'' a \ndouble precedent.\n  But let's be very clear, this draft opinion has no respect for \njudicial precedent. If the draft holds, all three of President Trump's \nnominees to the Supreme Court, along with some others already on the \nBench, will have deliberately deceived and defrauded the American \npublic.\n  Rightwing ideologues set out to stack the Court with Justices ready \nand willing to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  Now, this rightwing establishment, this machinery, is on the verge of \nachieving their goal, even though their win will be a horrible loss for \nthe reputation of the Supreme Court, a horrible loss for the integrity \nof our Constitution, and most of all, a horrible loss for the American \npeople.\n  More than half of the women and girls of reproductive age in our \ncountry live in States that would likely ban or severely restrict \nabortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\n  Thirteen States have so-called trigger laws that will kick into \neffect automatically the day Roe is overturned. Nine States have passed \nlaws that were struck down in the past because they violated the \nprotections of Roe, but those laws could come back if Roe v. Wade is \noverturned.\n  Many of these laws we are talking about are extreme. One trigger law \nin Kentucky would ban all abortions at any point in pregnancy, with no \nexceptions for rape, no exceptions for incest, or a situation in which \na child could be born with a fatal birth defect.\n\n  Another trigger law in Idaho would make providing an abortion at any \npoint in pregnancy and under almost any circumstances a felony crime \npunishable by 5 years in prison. A Texas law that is on the books right \nnow would put doctors in jail or fine them up to $10,000 for \nprescribing pills for medication abortions through telehealth or the \nmail for women who are more than 7 weeks pregnant.\n  And a law that has been on the books since 1931 in Michigan would \nsnap back into effect, making nearly all abortions at any point in \npregnancy a felony. And women who undergo medication abortions would be \nmade felons, even in the case of rape and incest.\n  Just last week, State legislators in the Louisiana House advanced a \nbill through committee that would allow women who obtain abortions at \nany time in pregnancy to be prosecuted for murder--for murder.\n  Experts say that this extreme law could also be used to restrict \nemergency contraception and in vitro fertilization, which is a critical \nprocess that helps customers with infertility build their families.\n  Like many of our colleagues, I have been hearing from my \nconstituents, my constituents in the State of Maryland, who have \nlearned just how dangerous this situation is for women and families \nacross the country. One constituent named Connie shared her story of \ntaking emergency contraception after she was attacked and raped by a \nstranger at the age of 18.\n  She told me about the importance of being able to make that choice \nabout her body and her future instead of potentially becoming pregnant \nbecause of a rape. Today, Connie is a social worker, a therapist, and \nhas a wonderful son.\n  I have received other testimonials from constituents across the State \nof Maryland who have shared their stories and expressed their deep \nconcern and fear about the Court striking down Roe v. Wade.\n  If Roe was overturned, women living in States where safe and legal \nabortion is banned will have to travel away from their homes, away from \ntheir communities, away from their families simply to exercise control \nover their own bodies.\n  Those who lack the money or the time will either be forced to carry \nan unwanted pregnancy to term or find somebody performing abortions in \nthe shadows in their States, a throwback to the dangerous back-alley \nabortions.\n  In 1965, 8 years before the Roe v. Wade decision, illegal abortion \naccounted for 17 percent--17 percent--of all deaths attributed to \npregnancy and childbirth. That past could soon be our present.\n  So, you see, this Supreme Court decision doesn't just turn back the \nclock on precedent, it turns back the clock on public health as it \nstrips women of their reproductive freedoms.\n  And in a world where Roe has been overturned, as you drive across our \ngreat country, your rights will change from State to State as you cross \neach State border. That is the result of taking away a constitutional \nright, and that is why polling shows the great majority of the American \npeople do not want the Supreme Court to take away the rights under Roe \nv. Wade.\n  Now, I am proud to represent a State that has codified a woman's \nright to reproductive choice. In fact, during my very first campaign \nfor public office, the right to reproductive choice was the defining \nissue in my election to the Maryland General Assembly. It was another \ntime when there was great fear that a Supreme Court might overturn Roe \nv. Wade.\n  And so I ran on the pro-choice ticket, and after I was sworn in, in a \nmatter of months, my colleagues and I passed a bill in 1991 codifying \nRoe v. Wade as a matter of Maryland State law.\n  But here is the thing, laws like the one we have in Maryland, laws \nlike the one we passed back in 1991, will be on the chopping block if \nthis decades-long, rightwing project continues to go according to plan \nbecause the Republicans' ultimate objective isn't just to overturn Roe \nv. Wade; it is to enact a Federal law passed in this Senate and in the \nHouse banning abortion nationwide.\n  Last week, Leader McConnell acknowledged that a national ban on \nabortion was a real possibility during an interview with USA TODAY. \nThat should sound alarm bells all over America.\n  This has been a two-step process. Step No. 1, strike down the \nconstitutional protections of Roe v. Wade that prohibit elected \nofficials, whether it is State legislatures or in Congress, from \nenacting laws that prohibit or restrict unnecessarily the right to \nchoose. That is step No. 1. It seems we are on the verge of that \nhappening.\n  Once you clear the way, step No. 2, enact a Federal law in Congress \nbanning abortion everywhere in the country, and we have seen exactly \nhow extreme those laws can be from the State examples I cited earlier. \nThat could happen here if this Republican, rightwing project sees its \nlogical end; that Federal law would supersede Maryland's law. If \nCongress passed that law and it was enacted, State laws like those in \nMaryland protecting the right to choose in Maryland would be knocked \noff the books. That is true of other State laws, statutes, that protect \na woman's right to choose.\n  No woman in America would be safe to obtain a safe and legal abortion \nif such a national law were enacted.\n  Now, everyone should also understand another huge danger posed by the \ndraft. Its flawed logic not only would dismantle the right to an \nabortion, it could also be used to strip away other rights protected by \nthe Constitution.\n  I have read Justice Alito's draft opinion. I have read all 98 pages \nof it.\n  In this opinion, Justice Alito tries to distinguish this case on \nabortion from other cases involving other individual rights. Alito \nclaims that this case is special because it involves abortion and the \nState's interest in protecting life, while other cases do not. Well, \nthat is obvious on its face, but it misses the bigger danger in Alito's \nopinion.\n  Because it doesn't change the fact that Justice Alito's reasoning for \ndismantling the right to obtain an abortion can be used to dismantle \nmany other rights that we currently take for granted as well. Justice \nAlito claims that, even as you look at the entire Constitution, you \ncannot find a right to choose for women; that you cannot derive that \nfrom the Constitution.\n  In fact, on page 5 of the draft opinion, Justice Alito writes:\n\n       The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no \n     such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional \n     provision.\n\n  And if we follow Justice Alito's flawed logic, the same could be said \nof a host of other rights that are not specifically named in the \nConstitution. The Constitution doesn't have the word ``contraception'' \nin it. The Constitution doesn't talk about consenting adults engaged in \nsexual relations.\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\n  Look, this is the thing: Over time, the Supreme Court has recognized \ncomponents of liberty through a close analysis of the Bill of Rights \nand the 14th Amendment, and that includes the right to use \ncontraception, the right of consenting adults to have sexual relations \nwith who they choose, and the right to marry who you love.\n  These are rights the American people don't want elected officials to \ntake away, whether they are State legislatures or Members of the Senate \nor the House. But they are all at peril too if the logic of Alito's \nreasoning is played out. And the terrible irony--the terrible irony--\nhere is those who most claim to oppose government regulations of any \nkind are now the ones rushing to regulate the most intimate, personal, \nand private aspects of American life. They say they don't want \ngovernment having any role in their life--get out of my way--except for \nwhen it comes to them taking away this right and planning to pass laws \nthat would ban abortion nationally, and as I said, open the door to \ngoing after other liberties as well.\n  So those are the stakes that we are facing as we gather here this \nevening in anticipation of tomorrow's vote. And that is why we are \ntaking this vote tomorrow. That is why we need to pass the Women's \nHealth Protection Act, but even if we fall short this time, having a \nvote now is important. It is important to the country. Democracy \nrequires accountability, and it is important that the American people \nknow where each of the Senators stands on this issue. It is a \nfundamental question.\n  So as we move into November toward the midterm elections, the \nAmerican people will be watching closely how Members of this body vote \non this fundamental constitutional question. And they will look to see \nwho voted to strip away constitutional rights and who rose to protect \nthem. And I believe that the majority of this country--the overwhelming \nmajority of this country--wants to stand up to protect fundamental \nliberties in the Constitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I will probably get in trouble with \nsomebody for saying this, but the question of when life begins, the \ndeeper question of what defines life, which biological entities are \nalive or possess independent existence versus which biological entities \nare simply part of something else that is alive--man, those are really \nhard questions.\n  I heard my colleague Senator Daines on the floor earlier tonight \ntalking passionately about his belief that life begins at conception \nand that humans have an obligation to defend a day-old fetus equally to \nour obligation to defend the life of someone who has been born.\n  Now, I disagree. I believe that life begins at birth. I believe that \nour legal obligation towards a born human is different than our legal \nobligation toward an unborn fetus. But on that narrow question of when \nlife begins, I don't cast any particular judgment on Senator Daines for \nbelieving what he believes. His belief system is shared by millions of \nAmericans--not the majority of Americans, but a significant share.\n  This disagreement that he and I have over when legally protected life \nbegins, though, is as significant and as important a disagreement as \nexists--right--because it is about the most foundational questions in \nhuman existence: What is life? Who decides whether a woman bears a \nchild? Who has control over that woman's body? Who has control over the \nmost sacred and critical function of a human being, the act of giving \nbirth? It just doesn't get any more important than that set of \nquestions.\n  And given this fundamental disagreement, given the weightiness of \nthese questions, given the large number of Americans who sit on either \nside of these questions, I come to one simple conclusion: No \ngovernment, no group of politicians, should make this decision for \nanyone else. This decision about whether to abort a pregnancy, so \nmorally complicated, so socially divisive, should and must be left to \nindividuals--in this case, to women--to decide.\n\n  Over the course of history, millions have died in fights over another \nweighty moral issue--the question of whether God exists, and if a God \nexists, exactly what form that being takes and what it requires of \nhumans. Disputes over religion have eradicated entire civilizations.\n  What does this have to do with Roe v. Wade?\n  Well, our Founding Fathers decided that there were some topics that \nwere so personal, so subject to disagreement and controversy, that \ngovernment should just be barred from registering judgment.\n  That is part of the reason why our civilization has not been plagued \nby wars between religious groups--a reality that continues to paralyze \nsocieties to this day in other parts of the world--because we keep \ngovernment out of the question of which God is the right God. That is \nup to every American to decide for themselves, even though many \nAmericans believe that the consequence of observing or following the \nwrong God is serious--eternal damnation, for some. The stakes are huge \nwhen it comes to religion, but government sits on the sidelines.\n  To me, that is an imperfect but instructive corollary to the debate \nover choice and abortion. The decision about whether to have an \nabortion is so personal, and the lack of consensus in the country on \nthe question is so unavoidable, as to make government intervention just \nas illegitimate as it would be if government tried to dictate to \nsomeone which religion they should follow.\n  Now, that is not the exact route that the Supreme Court traveled to \nget to the Roe decision, but it helps me understand why, from 1973 \nuntil today, the decision about whether or not to have an abortion has \nbeen a constitutional right of the individual, not the constitutional \nright of the government to decide.\n  Frankly, it has always been really hard for me to square how \nRepublicans, who so readily evangelize about small government, about \nthe importance of putting families and their decision-making processes \nfirst, about the evil of public sector overreach, are so enthusiastic \nabout the government micromanaging personal decisions about pregnancy \nor marriage or adoption.\n  Small government is great, I guess, for corporations, but it is not \nso great when it comes to the most intimate decisions that families \nmake.\n  And as I have said on this floor before, it is also hard to take \nseriously Republicans' passionate pleas for this body to defend the \nexistence of an unborn fetus when they seem to care so little about \nmany of the existential threats that are posed to every American after \nthey are born.\n  Today, this day, over 100 Americans are going to die from gunshot \nwounds, from murders, and suicides. And whether my Republican \ncolleagues agree with me or not that stricter gun laws is part of the \nsolution to this uniquely American epidemic that plagues those that are \nborn, I don't know that I have ever heard a Republican speech dedicated \nto this crisis on the floor of the Senate. I have heard dozens \ndedicated to the cause of those before birth. It seems that after \nbirth, life matters a little bit less to some people in this body.\n  So that is what I think. And as I said, I will probably get into some \nhot water for admitting that I understand the arguments that people \nlike Senator Daines make. I don't agree with his views, but I \nunderstand them. And my hope is, is that as we begin this debate over \nthe future of reproductive choice and health in this country, as this \ndebate heats up--because it is not going away. We are taking a vote \ntomorrow, but this is a debate that is going to consume this Nation if \nthe Alito opinion becomes law, which I believe it will.\n  My hope is that we are honest about the complexity of this debate, \nbut the Republicans are equally honest in the claims that they make.\n  Let me just briefly tell you what I mean.\n  Today, I heard Republican Senators making a whole bunch of claims \nthat are just so ungrounded in truth as to diminish the quality of what \nshould be a very important debate on a very weighty subject.\n  For instance, I heard Senators make the claim that the protesters who \nwere protesting outside or near Supreme Court Justices' homes \nthreatened violence against those Justices. That was\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nan explicit claim made by people who came down to this floor who might \nhave heard it on some unreputable website, but it is not true.\n  You can object to protesters being outside of public officials' \nhomes. It has happened to all of us, by the way, but don't make up \nthreats of violence just because it makes for a better story.\n  I heard one Senator say that the Women's Health Protection Act, for \nwhich I will proudly vote tomorrow, allows for garage abortions. That \nis not true. That is just plainly not true.\n  Every State requires that abortions be performed in licensed \nhealthcare facilities and nothing in the bill changes it. Don't say \nthat just because it makes a better story.\n  Many Republicans claim that the bill we are taking up tomorrow allows \nabortions up to the date of birth. That is not true either.\n  The Women's Health Protection Act does codify Roe v. Wade, but Roe \nonly protects a woman's right to have an abortion without restriction \nuntil viability and then afterward protects for the woman's health or \nrisk of death. The bill simply does not expand the circumstances under \nwhich an abortion can be performed beyond what currently exists in case \nlaw.\n  So I am going to be honest with my colleagues about the admitted \ncomplexities--the political, moral complexities of this debate. But I \nexpect opponents of the bill that we are debating tomorrow to be \nequally honest in the arguments they make as well.\n  So I will have a lot more to say about this topic as we begin what I \nthink is a debate that will consume this Nation, rightfully, over the \ncourse of the coming weeks and months, but for today I will leave it \nthere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-22"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Officer \n     Support Act of 2022''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Every day, public safety officers, including police \n     officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and \n     others, work to maintain the safety, health, and well-being \n     of the communities they serve.\n       (2) This means public safety officers are routinely called \n     to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic situations, \n     often putting their own lives in danger.\n       (3) This work not only puts public safety officers at-risk \n     for experiencing harm, serious injury, and cumulative and \n     acute trauma, but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher \n     risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when \n     compared to individuals without such experiences.\n       (4) Psychological evidence indicates that law enforcement \n     officers experience significant job-related stressors and \n     exposures that may confer increased risk for mental health \n     morbidities (such as post-traumatic stress disorder and \n     suicidal thoughts, ideation, intents, and behaviors) and \n     hastened mortality.\n       (5) Public safety officers often do not have the resources \n     or support they need, leaving them at higher risk for long-\n     term mental health consequences.\n       (6) Whereas, although the Department of Defense already \n     considers servicemember suicides to be line-of-duty deaths \n     and provides Federal support to eligible surviving families, \n     the Federal Government does not recognize public safety \n     officer suicides as deaths in the line of duty.\n       (7) In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 claims \n     under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program under \n     subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but \n     not one of them for the more than 240 public safety officers \n     who died by suicide that year.\n       (8) Public safety officers who have died or are disabled as \n     a result of suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder do not \n     qualify for the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, \n     despite the fact that public safety officers are more likely \n     to die by suicide than from any other line-of-duty cause of \n     death.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER DEATH BENEFITS FOR POST-\n                   TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ACUTE STRESS \n                   DISORDER, OR TRAUMA AND STRESS RELATED \n                   DISORDERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1201 of title I of the Omnibus \n     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(o) Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress \n     Disorder, or Trauma and Stress Related Disorders.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(A) Mass casualty event.--The term `mass casualty event' \n     means an incident resulting in casualties to not fewer than 3 \n     victims, including--\n       ``(i) an incident that exceeds the normal resources for \n     emergency response available\n\n[[Page H5121]]\n\n     in the jurisdiction where the incident takes place;

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Tennessee?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022 is another \nbipartisan bill that would expand eligibility for public safety \nofficers' benefits to include stress and trauma-related injuries and \ndeath by suicide for law enforcement officers and their families.\n  According to research from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, public safety officers are 25 times more \nlikely to develop acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, or other mental health conditions than the general public. \nThey have a tough job.\n  Studies have shown that law enforcement officers could experience \nmore traumatic events in 6 months than the average person will \nexperience in a lifetime.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, known as PSOB, provides \ndeath and education benefits to survivors of fallen law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, and other first responders, as well as \ndisability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in the line of \nduty.\n  Currently, this law excludes from eligibility families of officers \nwho die by suicide and does not deem PTSD and other trauma-related \ndisorders to be line-of-duty injuries.\n  This limitation not only fails to recognize that mental health is \nphysical health, but it also prevents the Federal Government from \nproviding support to officers who put their safety and well-being on \nthe line every day for the communities they serve.\n\n[[Page H5122]]\n\n  Former Representative Patrick Kennedy passed a bill to make mental \nhealth and physical health parity. He worked with Senator Ted Kennedy \nto get that done. Why law enforcement wasn't included was a mistake. We \nare rectifying that mistake today.\n  The Public Safety Officer Support Act would right past wrongs and \nensure that families of police officers and first responders receive \ncritical financial assistance as they grieve the loss of their loved \nones.\n  It would also ensure that officers who are disabled as a result of \ntraumatic events receive the support and care that they need.\n  This legislation also brings this program into alignment with the \nprovisions of Federal military death benefits for the families of \nmilitary servicemembers who die by suicide.\n  The need for this worthy and overdue change is even more apparent as \nwe continue to grieve the tragic loss of four police officers who died \nby suicide after responding to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on \nJanuary 6, 2021.\n  They tried to defend us; they did defend us; and they, unfortunately, \ndied by suicide as aftermath effects of January 6.\n  In addition to expanding eligibility for death and disability \nbenefits to officers and their families, this bill will require the GAO \nto study benefits provided under the expansion.\n  This report will help us better understand the prevalence of \ntraumatic events that law enforcement officers, first responders, and \nother public safety officers face and the need to further support their \nmental health needs.\n  I thank Representatives Trone and Reschenthaler for introducing this \nbipartisan legislation and for their continued support for public \nsafety officers serving communities across the country.\n  This bill is broadly supported by both mental health and law \nenforcement groups, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a week we set aside \nto honor the brave men and women who tirelessly work to protect us and \nkeep our communities safe.\n  Unfortunately, their jobs are becoming more and more difficult, more \nand more stressful, and as a result, they need our support now more \nthan ever.\n  Over the last 2 years, violent crime in this Nation has soared. \nNationally, we saw a 30 percent increase in murders from 2019 to 2020, \nwhich is the largest increase during a single year in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  That troubling trend continues in 2021 with FBI data indicating that \nhomicides rose another 5 percent in the Nation's 22 largest cities over \nthe already inflated levels of 2020.\n  Overall, in those 22 cities, homicides are up 44 percent since 2019. \nThink of that--44 percent. Not surprisingly, these disturbing increases \nhave accompanied calls in many cities, including in my hometown of \nCincinnati, to defund the police. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, that is \nthe last thing that we should be doing during a violent crime surge.\n  That is why the legislation that we are considering today is a \nwelcome bipartisan step in the right direction.\n  Law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, \nand corrections officers are frequently called to respond to dangerous \nand often traumatic situations. As a result, these officers are at a \ngreater risk of developing stress and trauma-related disorders.\n  Studies show that public safety officers are 25 times more likely to \ndevelop PTSD compared to the general public. Tragically, more public \nsafety officers die by suicide every year than those who lose their \nlives in the line of duty.\n  Yet, trauma-related disorders are not covered by the primary Federal \ndisability benefits program for police officers, and that is the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits Program, or PSOB, which is run by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The PSOB program currently provides death and education benefits to \nthe family members of public safety officers who die in the line of \nduty and also offers disability benefits to public safety officers who \nbecome totally and permanently disabled.\n  However, the PSOB program does not currently offer death benefits to \npublic safety officers who tragically take their lives as a result of \nPTSD, acute stress disorder, or other stress and trauma-related \ndisorders.\n  This bill, H.R. 6943, the Public Safety Officer Support Act, \naddresses this oversight. This bipartisan legislation recognizes just \nhow stressful and difficult being a police officer is nowadays. It \nmakes sure that those officers who have experienced traumatic events on \nthe job, and are struggling as a result, receive the support they need \nand deserve.\n  The men and women in law enforcement need to know that they have our \nfull support and that they will not be punished or stigmatized for \nhuman emotions.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \ncommonsense, compassionate proposal, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Trone), the sponsor of this legislation and a gentleman \naware of law enforcement's importance.\n  Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass \nour bill, the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022, so we keep \ntackling mental health stigma across this country.\n  It has been almost 3 years since Montgomery County Officer T.J. Bomba \npassed away from suicide. He was 38 years old and left behind a wife \nand two sons.\n  In the immediate aftermath, we brought together Officer Bomba's \ncolleagues and the head of NIMH, Dr. Joshua Gordon, and others to chart \na course of action. We discussed access to care, the stigma surrounding \nmental health, and how we could be advocates for change.\n  The roundtable produced two calls to action: increasing peer \ncounseling support opportunities for mental health and providing parity \nand benefits for mental health conditions.\n  I made a promise that day to do everything I could to turn these \nideas into law. Six months ago, we accomplished one of our goals when I \nstood alongside Officer Bomba's wife and two sons as President Biden \nsigned the first of our two bills into law.\n  The COPS Counseling Act increased access to peer support and will \nhelp fight stigma and improve access to mental health services. Today, \nI stand here and applaud the passage of our second bill, the Public \nSafety Officer Support Act of 2022.\n  According to research from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, public safety officers are 25 times more \nlikely to develop acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, or other mental health conditions than our general public, \nand the conditions often go untreated due to the stigma of mental \nhealth.\n  As it stands, mental health is excluded from the PSOB program. For \nofficers killed in the line of duty, the family is eligible to receive \nbenefits. However, when an officer dies by suicide that is directly \ntied to their job, the family is unable to seek death benefits.\n  This bill will address the issue of stigma and provide the overdue \nparity between physical and mental injuries.\n  Officers that are totally disabled as a result of their service will \nhave access to disability benefits. The families of officers who pass \naway from service-linked suicide will have access to death benefits.\n  This approach has been endorsed by numerous mental health \norganizations, including the American Foundation for Suicide \nPrevention.\n  With the help of the public safety officer community, mental health \nexperts, and my colleagues in Congress, I am proud to bring this piece \nof legislation before the House.\n  I thank everyone who joined the roundtable in 2019. We have taken a \ntragedy and turned it into actionable solutions.\n  I thank all the stakeholders who have worked hard to bring this \nlegislation to the House floor. I appreciate their hard work. I thank, \nCongressman Reschenthaler, for co-leading this bill and for helping us \ngive it strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H5123]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. Craig), former ace Commercial Appeal reporter and now \nCongresswoman from the State of Minnesota.\n  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, Cory Slifko was a father of two, a husband, \nand an accomplished veteran of the South St. Paul Police Department. He \nspent 20 years on the force, eventually working his way up to serve as \na sergeant.\n  But Cory also spent 20 years witnessing the unthinkable and \nunimaginable and was ultimately diagnosed with PTSD. On November 5, \n2019, Cory lost his life to completed suicide, leaving behind his wife, \nKatie, and their children.\n  Now, there is not a doubt in my mind that Cory's death occurred as a \nresult of his service in the line of duty. But today, Katie's family \nhas not been able to access the benefits that Cory earned in service to \nour community.\n  It is vital that these programs don't just protect our law \nenforcement officers from physical harm but also from mental injuries \nthey endure in service to our communities.\n  We can change that today. It is time we right this wrong and offer \nsome long-overdue support to Katie, who has honored Cory through her \nadvocacy. I urge all of you to join me in voting ``yes'' on this bill.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want everyone to vote in favor of this \nlegislation and not to go to the extraordinary efforts of having to \nhave the yeas and nays, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6943, the \nbipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act, which would expand the \nPublic Safety Officer Benefits Program to include death benefits for \nthe families of officers who die by suicide, and disability benefits \nfor officers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other \ntrauma related disorders.\n  During Police Week, as we honor the men and women of law enforcement \nagencies who serve across the country, we must fully consider the \nsacrifices officers make and the risks they take to keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  Officers who dedicate their careers to our safety do so at the \nexpense of spending long hours away from their families, while \nsubjecting themselves to traumatic events, and in too many instances, \nmaking the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The Public Safety Officer Benefits program is an important initiative \nwithin the Department of Justice that provides financial support to \nofficers, who are injured while serving their communities in the line \nof duty, and to families of officers killed in the line of duty.\n  In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 PSOB claims, but not \na single claim for the over 240 public safety officers who died by \nsuicide.\n  Unfortunately, the PSOB program does not currently cover injury or \ndeath caused by trauma and/or mental illness, although public safety \nofficers are disproportionately exposed to traumatic events.\n  Research shows that law enforcement officers are called to the scene \nof roughly 140 traumatic incidents over the course of their careers.\n  The resulting rates of PTSD and depression among police officers and \nfirefighters are unsurprisingly five times higher than among the \ncivilian population.\n  While we have known for some time that law enforcement officers are \nmore likely to die by suicide than by traffic accidents and shootings \ncombined, officer suicides have increased over the last two years.\n  Sadly, several examples come to mind, including Amanda Crowder, a \nHarris County Deputy with the Harris County Sheriff's Office in \nHouston, who died in January after shooting herself; two deputies in \nSt. Lucie County, Florida, who both died by suicide days apart, leaving \nbehind their one-month-old son; and four police officers, of the \nCapitol Police and Washington Metropolitan Police Departments, who died \nby suicide after fighting valiantly to protect members of Congress and \npreserve the rule of law on January 6, 2021.\n  The families of the officers who died by suicide following the \nJanuary 6th attack are likely barred from receiving any benefit from \nthe PSOB program under current law.\n  The failure to provide PSOB benefits to deserving officers and their \nfamilies under such circumstances is a deeply troubling limitation on \nfederal support for first responders and their families that must be \nrectified.\n  And it is drastically different from the United States' military \npolicy, where suicides are presumed to be line-of-duty deaths caused by \npost-traumatic stress, brain injuries, and other deployment hazards.\n  Now is the time for the Federal government to similarly support \npublic safety officers suffering from trauma-related injuries and their \nfamilies.\n  Expansion of the PSOB program would provide crucial financial support \nto officers and families grieving the devastating loss of a loved one, \nfollowing a line of duty injury caused by trauma.\n  H.R. 6943 would correct a historic wrong by recognizing the impact of \nPTSD and other stress disorders on our public safety officers and \nexpanding the eligibility of the PSOB program to include trauma-related \ninjuries and death by suicide.\n  I thank Representatives David Trone and Guy Reschenthaler for \nintroducing this thoughtful, bipartisan legislation and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 6943, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-22"}

My answer was a simple \nword: ``no.''\n  Less than 4 years ago, the senior Senator from Illinois said nuking \nthe legislative filibuster ``would be the end of the Senate as it was \noriginally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers.'' \nNow, he wants the Senate to end on his watch.\n  The last time Senate Democrats were in the minority, 32 of them \nsigned a letter demanding the legislative filibuster stay in place. \nNow, many of them say they want to break this institution. The excuses \nput forward for this behavior are entirely fake. The supposed \njustifications are simply false. The Senate Democratic leaders are \ntrying to use a big lie to bully and berate their own Members into \nbreaking their word, breaking the rules, and breaking the Senate.\n  We are going to spend all week sounding the alarm on the radical \ntakeovers that some Democrats want to pull off. They want to silence \nmillions of Americans and take over the Senate so they can take over \nelections so they can take over America.\n  Leading Democrats say they want to break the Senate because of the \nsinister anti-voting plot that is sweeping America. Of course, this is \ntotally fake. It does not exist. The current control of Congress and \nthe White House were decided in 2020 by the highest turnout in 120 \nyears. Ninety-four percent of voters said voting was easy. More \nAmericans say current voting laws are too lax than say they are too \nrestrictive.\n\n  Confronted by the facts, the Democratic leader says they are, of \ncourse, irrelevant. He says the entire nuclear push is occasioned by \nwhat a few States did in 2021. This is utter nonsense. The Senator from \nNew York has been publicly laying groundwork to nuke the Senate rules \nsince back in 2019, before the 2020 election. More than a year before \nthe 2020 election, the Democratic leader was openly flirting with \nnuking the Senate rules if he got the power so he would be able to ram \nthrough bigger changes. Now, none of this was occasioned by what State \nlegislatures did in 2021. This is actually a yearslong quest for power \nin search of a pretext.\n  Their hysterical attack on State laws are fake as well. The State of \nGeorgia passed a voting law providing for more in-person early voting \nthan New York provides. It allows for no-excuse absentee voting, which \nNew York prohibits. If there was not a voting crisis in Democrat-run \nNew York 6 months ago, there is no crisis in Georgia now. If Georgia is \na banana republic today, then New York has been and still is a banana \nrepublic. There is zero logic here, zero consistency.\n  In the State of Texas, Democrats are hysterical because the State \nrolled back some unusual COVID-specific exceptions to their prior \nprocedures, such as universal drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. \nSo if the bar for voting rights now requires the possibility of voting \nin person at 3 a.m., how many blue States in America meet that bar? \nNeither of these things existed in Texas before 2020, and neither \nwidely exists in blue States.\n  Every hysterical claim that our democracy is in crisis rings hollow. \nMore Americans today say that President Biden's election was \nlegitimate--now listen to this--than said the same thing about the \nprior President in late 2017. More Americans today say that President \nBiden's election was legitimate than said the same about the prior \nPresident in late 2017. Yet Democrats are trying to use their fake \nhysteria to justify breaking Senate rules so they can seize control of \nelections in all 50 States. That is what they are up to.\n  Historically, the Senate has taken up elections legislation on a \ncareful, bipartisan basis. We have made sure not to trample on the \nrights of voters and the proper roles of local officials.\n  In 2002, we passed the Help America Vote Act by a vote of 92 to 2--92 \nto 2. Chris Dodd and I authored that bill. Interestingly enough, the \nonly dissenting votes came from then-Senator Hillary Clinton and the \ncurrent Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. Ninety-two to two.\n  Well, that is how you pass election reform if there are actual issues \nthat need tackling. You do it carefully; you do it thoughtfully; \nbipartisan committee work; regular order. Our colleagues aren't doing \nanything like that. They are trying to ram through a sweeping, partisan \nlegislation that they first drafted and introduced in its first \niteration back in 2019.\n  Democrats say they are concerned about efforts to disempower the \nappropriate local elections officials. Well, it is actually their bills \nthat would disempower local officials, by Washington Democrats \nappointing themselves the entire country's board of elections on \nsteroids.\n  Democrats say they are concerned about overturning election results. \nWell, it is their bills that would overturn election results, \noverruling the commonsense voting laws that citizens across the country \npick for their own States.\n  A case in point: The Democrats' latest bill would force the entire \ncountry to adopt two practices--same-day registration and no-excuse \nabsentee voting--that the citizens of New York State had as ballot \nmeasures last November. Deep-blue New York rejected them both. So you \nhave to ask yourself, why are Washington Democrats refusing to accept \nthe decision of New York voters? Why are they trying to set aside these \nelection results and overturn the people's will?\n  Our Democratic colleagues also talked about a so-called voting rights \nbill. This is a bill to turn the partisan Attorney General into a \nnational elections czar. The Attorney General would no longer have to \nsue States to win in court; he could end up doing an end run around the \nlegal system and push States around without having to persuade a judge \nfirst. I am sure our Democratic colleagues would have reacted well if \nRepublicans had tried to break Senate rules so that Bill Barr could \nmicromanage elections in blue States. I am sure that would have gone \nswimmingly on their side of the aisle.\n  But, ultimately, the issues at stake this week run even deeper than \nthis fake hysteria, even deeper than voting laws. Breaking the Senate \nitself and nuking the filibuster would cause a massive political power \noutage for many millions of American citizens, for entire States.\n  So the filibuster is not just about what bills are blocked; it is \nalso the sole feature that gives millions of Americans any voice at all \nin the legislation that does pass whenever there is one-party control. \nAnnual appropriations, government funding bills, the NDAA, rescue \npackages like the CARES Act--all of them could be done on a one-party \nbasis, thereby eliminating the influence of every State in America \nrepresented by a Member of the minority.\n  For decades, both Senators and citizens have been able to take for \ngranted that everybody gets a voice, even when they don't have divided \ngovernment. If this unique feature of the Senate is blown up, millions \nand millions of Americans' voices will cease to be heard in this \nChamber--a radical Senate takeover, for a radical elections takeover, \nfor a radical takeover of our Nation's future.\n\n  What the Democratic leader wants to do would not protect our \ndemocracy or our system of government. It would destroy a key feature \nof American Government forever, and the Senators on both sides know it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I listened carefully to the Republican \nleader's statement about the institutions of the Senate, the traditions \nof the\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nSenate, the rules of the Senate, the precedents of the Senate, and why \nwe are dutybound to follow them, but I couldn't get this image out of \nmy mind as he spoke: the image of that news that came to us one day \nthat Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had tragically passed away.\n  And we all remember what happened next. It was the same Republican \nleader who sent the word out to his Republican Members: Don't even \nentertain the possibility that President Obama is going to fill this \nvacancy on the Supreme Court. We are going to keep this vacancy open in \nthe hopes that we can elect a Republican President to fill it.\n  Now, that was 8 months at least, maybe 10 months, before the \nelection. And it was the first time in the history of the United States \nthat a Republican leader of the Senate used his power to browbeat his \nmembers not even to meet with Merrick Garland, the President's nominee, \nPresident Obama's nominee. They wouldn't even entertain an office \nmeeting with him to discuss it. It was out of the question. The Supreme \nCourt was going to have 8 members, period, and not one more because \nthere was an election coming and a Republican opportunity in that \nelection. And so that is what happened. You remember it well, and I do \ntoo.\n  So when I hear about preserving the sanctity of traditions in the \nSenate, I can't help but remember that vacant seat on the Supreme Court \nfor almost a year. I cannot help but remember that in the last year of \nObama's Presidency that he was denied the opportunity which other \nPresidents routinely were given to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \nThat was the reality.\n  And now there is a question of the future of the filibuster, and I \nwill concede that the filibuster has been part of the profile in the \nSenate for a long, long time--for many decades. But what the Senate \nRepublican leader fails to note is that the use of the filibuster is \nout of control.\n  We now have filibusters threatened on everything in sight. It was by \ndesign, not by accident. And it was by design to slow down the business \nof the Senate and stop the production of the Senate, and that is why \nday after weary day this Chamber is empty. Nothing is happening because \na filibuster is usually looming over the body.\n  And for those who want to restore the Senate to an actual legislative \nbody with actual debate and amendments on the floor, we are being told \nby the Republican leader that we are somehow denying the basic \nbirthright of the Senate, and we know that is wrong. We know that the \nSenate, as many of us remember, has changed dramatically.\n  It was 25 years ago that I came to the Senate. We voted a lot. We \nactually had 12 appropriations bills come to the floor of the Senate \nevery year--every year--under an open process where any amendment could \nbe offered and debated and voted on, and ultimately that appropriations \nbill would go into conference with the House and end up doing what it \nwas supposed to do, funding our government.\n\n  I can't remember the last time that happened. I think it has been 10 \nyears now since the subcommittees for appropriations did their normal \nbusiness with the budget resolution and prepared these bills. It is \ngone. Why? Why is it gone? Wasn't it the tradition of the Senate that \nyou consider those bills? It is gone because of abuse of the \nfilibuster.\n  Any amendment that is offered is threatened with a 60-vote \nrequirement and things grind to a halt. And you know the net result of \nit? We have something called an omnibus. All the spending bills are \nmerged into one massive piece of legislation. Let the staff write it. \nLet the Members look over their shoulder and see if there is anything \nin there of interest, and we pass it year after year after year.\n  Is that another fine tradition of the Senate that we want to protect? \nI hope not.\n  Let me say a word about voting, if I can. For as long as we have had \nthis Nation, there has always been a basic question as to who will \nchoose the leaders.\n  Our Founding Fathers showed a lot of wisdom, but they missed it when \nit came to voting--at least by this century's standards because they \ndenied the vote to African Americans who, by and large, were slaves in \nthat culture, and they denied the vote to women. And they said that \nbasically propertied individuals were the ones who would choose the \nleaders of our country.\n  We have a different view of America's democracy today, and many of us \nbelieve that every eligible person in this country should be given an \nopportunity to vote that is not a hardship.\n  So in the 2020 election, we had a record turnout. There were many of \nus who felt we should build on that to have an even larger turnout in \nthe next election--let the people speak, let the people vote.\n  And in about 20 different State legislatures controlled by the \nRepublicans, exactly the opposite was decided. They decided that they \nwould restrict opportunities to vote. Too many darn people voted in \nthat 2020 election, and the results weren't what some of the Republican \nlegislatures and Governors expected. So they decided they wanted to \nchange it--reduce the opportunity for early voting, reduce the \nopportunities for registration, reduce the opportunity for same-day \nregistration.\n  They argued that some States have them and some don't. Well, the \nbottom line, as we see it on the Democratic side, is if we are going to \nopen opportunity for people across the country who are eligible to vote \nwithout hardship, then we ought to do it across the board, and that is \nwhy we support legislation--Federal legislation ordained and envisioned \nby our Constitution to establish standards that will make it easier to \nvote.\n  The Senator from Kentucky likes to come to the floor and say, well, \nNew York doesn't have all those good things. He may be right. But why \nshouldn't they? As far as I am concerned, Illinois, New York, Hawaii, \nall States should be governed by standards and give people an \nadditional opportunity to vote.\n  I would rather come down on the side of a larger turnout of the \nelectorate and let democracy speak than the alternative, which is being \nsuggested by the Republican leader. They want to selectively make it \ndifficult for some people to come and vote. I don't. I think they are \nwrong.\n  Time and again, the Senate Republican leader came to the floor and \ncalled things fake. I guess we are now into that characterization and \ncan thank President Trump for leading us down that path. What is not \nfake is this. Throughout the history of the United States, the \nopportunity to vote has been denied, primarily to people of color and \nthe poor, year after year, in an effort to try to ensure that election \nresults turned out a certain way.\n  For the longest time, my Democratic Party was guilty of that sin. I \nreadily confess it because history makes it clear, but now that mantle \nhas been passed to the party of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party, \nwhich is now trying to restrict the right to vote across the Nation.\n  When you heard that in Georgia you couldn't provide water or food to \npeople waiting in line, it probably struck most Americans as odd. Why \nwould they say that?\n  Well, visualize, if you will, the lines of voters, and you will find, \nif your memory is the same as mine, that largely they were minority \nvoters who were standing in line for hours to vote--hours to vote.\n  And so the Georgia State Legislature and others have said, if you \ngive them water or food, you have violated the law. Let them stand in \nline without any support.\n  Really? Is that what it has come down to? The fear that if you give a \ncup of water to someone waiting in line to vote, you are buying their \nvote? I just can't believe the thinking that leads to that. But we know \nbehind it were a lot of situations where machinery and voting places \nwere limited to minority populations.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-01-23"}

Every proposal included in this \npackage is bipartisan.\n  Some have said: Well, COVID is over, and the restaurants are back. I \nsee them sort of full.\n  That may be true for some restaurants, but for just about every \nrestaurant, there is a shortage of labor, and many are only opening at \nlimited times. Most of the restaurants I speak to are either closed \ncertain days, don't serve lunches, or whatever, because they can't find \nlabor.\n  Let's not forget that many of the restaurants, particularly the \nsmaller ones, the nonchain ones, had to borrow during COVID, borrow \nlarge amounts of money. They need to repay that money, and they can't \ndo it based on their limited incomes that are occurring right now. If \nthey don't get the money to pay it back, the lenders are going to \nforeclose and close restaurants that are already back on the road to \nprospering and recovering. That makes no sense.\n  We must pass this legislation. I hope we will get a good number of \nour Republican colleagues to join Senator Wicker in supporting this. \nTwo years into this crisis, the idea that restaurant owners have all \nrecovered could not be further from the truth.\n  Restaurants are part of the fabric of every Main Street and every \ntight-knit neighborhood. It is where friends run into each other on the \nweekends, grab a drink after work, have lunch after church. The same \ncan be applied to minor league teams and local gyms and businesses that \nsupport theaters. These are places where Americans have always come \ntogether.\n\n  I was proud to champion the $28 billion restaurant relief in the \nAmerican Rescue Plan, but these establishments, as I mentioned, still \nneed our help. Tomorrow, there should be a strong bipartisan show of \nsupport to help these businesses.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-22"}

Mr. President, I listened to the Republican minority \nleader, Senator McConnell, speak on the floor this morning. I have to \ntell you, on the issue of immigration, there are several things which \nhe said which are not accurate and that I would like to clarify for the \nRecord.\n  First, this morning, Senator McConnell said:\n\n       Orderly, legal immigration is part of what makes America \n     strong. Anarchy and open borders make us weak.\n\n  I don't know of any rational person who would disagree with that \ncomment.\n  But I think, for the record, we should make clear that, 8 years ago, \nwhen we considered comprehensive immigration reform--a bipartisan \nbill--on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the Senator from Kentucky voted \nagainst it. There were 14 Republican Senators who voted for this \nmeasure. It passed the Senate. It was the product of a bipartisan \nCommission--a self-appointed committee, really--the so-called Gang of \n8. I want to recount the names of those who were on that committee who \nproduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill. I was on the \ncommittee with Chuck Schumer, Senator Bob Menendez, and the Senator \nfrom the Presiding Officer's home State of Colorado, Senator Michael \nBennet. On the Republican side, it was led by Senator John McCain, \nSenator Lindsey Graham, Senator Marco Rubio, and then-Senator from \nArizona Jeff Flake.\n  We worked for months. We put in all of the effort that was expected \nof us to address an issue which had not been addressed by Congress for \n25 years, which was to try to upgrade our immigration system--to do \nwhat Senator McConnell says needs to be done: orderly, legal \nimmigration. That was what the bill sought to achieve. There were 14 \nRepublicans who joined us in voting for it. Senator McConnell did not, \nand we have not had another measure since then.\n  The bill we passed in the Senate was sent over to the Republican-\ncontrolled House of Representatives. They refused to even consider it \nin committee or on the floor or to bring it to a vote. We missed an \nopportunity, and it was an opportunity on many different levels. It \nwould have finally addressed the issue of legal immigration in America, \nwhich is a critically important measure.\n  Throughout our history, without exception, year in and year out, \nlegal immigrants have come to this country.\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\nThere have been some terrible laws passed by Congress in relation to \nthose having been allowed in this country. The reality is we have \nacknowledged from the beginning of America as we know it that \nimmigrants have been a part of our present and are a part of our \nfuture, and now we face the same reality again without the benefit of \nhaving an update in the laws, which the Republican leader voted \nagainst.\n  I recall specifically the work of Senator Bennet from Colorado. He \ndid a remarkable thing, something that people didn't think was really \npossible. He managed to bring together all of the interest groups on \nthe issue of legal immigration for those working in agriculture. He \nmanaged to find an agreement among all of these groups as to the humane \nand sensible treatment of these individuals. If that would have passed, \nit would have changed the circumstances we have today--circumstances \nwherein we do not have nearly enough legal immigrants to work in the \nagricultural sector of America. It is estimated that one out of two--50 \npercent--of all of the ag workers today are undocumented. We still eat \nthe food that they pick and harvest, and we still take advantage of \ntheir hard work in the meat processing plants. Yet the reality is that \nwe know, in our heart of hearts, that they are not being treated in a \nsensible, reasonable, humane way.\n  Senator Bennet, time and again, has shown leadership on this issue as \nhe did with the Gang of 8. Once again, we find ourselves, because the \nbill failed in the previous Congress, without a guiding law on \nstandards of immigration.\n\n  There were other things said by Senator McConnell this morning which \nI want to make reference to as well, particularly as to the busing of \nthose currently in the United States, as new, legally recognized \nimmigrants, to various cities around the United States.\n  Governors from the States of Texas, Arizona, and Florida have been \nbusing those who have been crossing the border and who are legally \nrecognized to stay here until further hearing to communities like New \nYork, Washington, Chicago, and even to Martha's Vineyard in \nMassachusetts. The thing that we have got to keep in mind is that these \nGovernors do not call local officials first. They don't even contact \nthe Governors of these States where they are sending these people. So \nthey arrive, helter-skelter, in unpredictable numbers and conditions, \nand the local officials are expected to take care of them.\n  Listen to what Senator McConnell had to say in describing what I have \njust told you.\n  He said:\n\n       Out of desperation, a few Governors along our southern \n     border are now giving some Democrat-run States and cities \n     just a tiny, tiny taste of what border communities have been \n     enduring literally for years.\n\n  What he is trying to say to us is this is an act of political spite. \nIt is a political stunt by these Governors. And what are they using to \nmake their point? Innocent people--here legally in the United States--\nwho are being shipped off, many times, with deception and promises that \nwill never be kept in terms of opportunities for them in these various \nplaces.\n  Senator McConnell went on to say:\n\n       All those cities combined have had months to accept between \n     them approximately 1 day's share of our Nation's illegal \n     immigration.\n\n  Immigrants--about four dozen--were given secure transportation, \naccording to Senator McConnell, ``to the wealthy, liberal destination \nof Martha's Vineyard, filled with millionaires' mansions''--so-called \nsanctuary destinations.\n  Do you see the point that is being made here? These people are being \nbused without any warning as to where they are going to end up--where \ntheir final destinations may be--simply to make the political point \nthat the Democrats have to be reminded of the Republicans' position on \nimmigration. We are doing this at the expense of many innocent people, \nand we are doing this in a dangerous fashion.\n  I will tell you that I visited the Salvation Army center in Chicago, \nIL, about 10 days ago, and I met with these families and individuals. \nLittle children are involved in this calculation.\n  Why is it that whenever the Republicans want to make a point on \nimmigration, it always ends up being the children who are the pawns, \nwhether they are kids in cages or forcefully removing children from \ntheir parents or in this case, busing them off with their parents to \ncommunities they have never heard of? Why does it always involve \nfamilies with small children? You would think there would be more \nsensitivity on the Republican side to that reality.\n  Then Senator McConnell made a statement which I want to correct. He \nsaid the Biden administration has been flying and busing illegal \nimmigrants around the country on a regular basis. This is not true. We \nchecked again this morning with the Biden administration. They are not \nexercising that right.\n  What we have going on are the transfers of those who are not in legal \nstatus back and forth between various facilities and the transfers of \nunaccompanied children, with escorts, to places like Chicago and other \ncities where, for decades, they have been cared for until their legal \nstatus is resolved. But this statement that the Biden administration is \nguilty of busing people back and forth is not true at all. I think the \nrecord should be clarified, and I hope the Senator from Kentucky will \ndo so when he receives the first opportunity.\n  The Biden administration has said: We have the authority to do it, \nbut we have not exercised it and will not unless we confer with \nCongress and also notify local officials as to whether anyone will be \nmoved.\n  Now, there are circumstances and have been in the past that I know of \npersonally on the border of Texas and Mexico where people had come and \nbeen released. They found they had credible fear. They asserted it. \nThey have legal status, and they want to go to a specific location \nwhere they have friends and family. In those cases, there is help given \nto them to reach those destinations. But it is not the current \nsituation where the Governors of Florida, Texas, and Arizona are \ndeceiving these people onto these buses and sending them to places they \nhave never heard of and not letting those who are in their destinations \neven know what it coming.\n  What is the right thing to do? The right thing to do is what we did 8 \nyears ago: a bipartisan approach to fixing the immigration system. \nInstead of exploiting it for political purposes, let's fix it.\n  We have done that. We passed legislation on a bipartisan basis even \nin this evenly divided Senate. The CHIPS bill--this important \nsemiconductor chip production bill--was a bipartisan bill. The \ninfrastructure bill--the biggest highway program in the history of the \nUnited States since Dwight Eisenhower--was a bipartisan bill. The gun \nsafety bill--a controversial issue, just as controversial as \nimmigration--we passed that on a bipartisan basis. We can do it, but we \nhave to stop exploiting these people who are here with children. We \nhave to do it by stopping exploiting this issue and work together on a \nbipartisan basis, with give on both sides. That is how we can reach a \nbipartisan solution.\n  I am ready to do that. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we would \nstart as soon as we have Republicans of good will willing to sit down \nwith Democrats and work together. But continuing to exploit these \npeople and the children and these families is just plain wrong. It is \nnot consistent with American values. It doesn't reflect well on our \nNation.\n  I hope that the people who are inspired to do this--the Governors in \nFlorida, Texas, and Arizona--will think twice about these kids and \ntheir families before they try it again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-10-01"}

Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague \nfrom the State of Washington, Senator Cantwell, for her passion for \npeople and the rights of people to vote, and her willingness to \nactually go through the details of the groups outside of this Congress \nthat feel so strongly about this, including businesses, as pointed out, \nthat understand that you can't do business overseas--having just come \nback from Ukraine, from which I just arrived an hour ago--and uphold \ndemocracies overseas, if we are allowing our democracy to go to \nshambles by allowing voter suppression laws to pass, as they have in \nnumerous States across the country.\n  Just this week, we marked the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and, today, we are considering legislation that goes to the \nvery heartbeat of the democracy--the freedom to vote--that so many have \nfought and died for.\n  We are here because a flood of State laws to roll back voting has \nsurged up since the 2020 elections, when in the 2020 elections, in the \nmiddle of a pandemic, more Americans cast a ballot than ever before. \nThey were willing to take those risks, and the laws were changed in red \nStates and blue States and purple States to allow them to do that.\n  But now what do we see? A rollback. A rollback in the Presiding \nOfficer's great State of Wisconsin. We see rollbacks attempted across \nthe Nation in places like Montana, with same-day registration in place \nfor 15 years. And 8,000 people took avail of it in the last election to \neither change their address or register that way.\n  So then what happens? Well, say the Republican legislature in Montana \nsays: Why don't we get rid of something we have had in place for 15 \nyears? Why don't we do that?\n  Guess what that creates, my friends. Maximum confusion and ultimate \nvoter suppression.\n  With that core freedom of voting now at stake, it is on us to stand \nup and to take up the torch that Dr. King and so many brave Americans \ncarried decades ago and acted to preserve the foundational right of our \ndemocracy. And while that may sound like an ambitious task, it is one \nwithin our reach. By passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, we \ncan meet these challenges and turn back the tide.\n\n  Today, I want to address a topic that has loomed large over this \nhistoric debate, and that has to do with the very rules of this \nChamber.\n  This week, every Member of the Senate will have a chance to cast a \nvote that will determine if this is a legislative body that will rise \nto meet a test. The test is participation and voting. The test is \nactually being able to take on the issues of our day.\n  It won't be the first time. Indeed, four times already this Congress, \nour Republican colleagues have blocked us from even considering \nlegislation to protect the freedom to vote. But we are here again this \nweek. We are here because, to quote Ella Baker, a granddaughter of \nslaves from Virginia who worked alongside some of the great leaders of \nthe civil rights movement, ``We who believe in freedom cannot rest.''\n  So while much has been made of our colleagues who have not committed \nto join us in this effort to change the Senate rules, we must remain \nsteadfast in the truth that the right to vote in this country is not \nnegotiable. We must forge ahead.\n  I want to start by responding to some of the points that have been \nraised as reasons not to move forward with legislation at this \nwatershed moment, as reasons not to do what it takes when it comes to \nprotecting this most sacred of rights--the right to vote.\n  Some have argued that allowing voting rights legislation to pass the \nSenate without clearing a 60-vote threshold would be a mistake that \nwould open the door to somehow leading to wild swings in Federal \npolicy. I am trying to imagine this place ever being involved in such a \nthing given how slowly we go and how many people understandably want to \nmake sure we are careful in how we pass laws, but that is one of the \nthings that have been raised for why we need some kind of a 60-vote \nthreshold, which, of course, is not in the Constitution. The words \n``filibuster'' and ``cloture'' are not in the Constitution. In fact, \nlegislatures across this land, some of which do very good things, do \nnot use a 60-vote threshold. In fact, democracies across the world do \nnot use a 60-vote threshold.\n  The truth is this: We have tried for months to persuade our \nRepublican colleagues to join us in supporting legislation, to work \nwith us, to debate it,\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nbut what they do is they throw a wrench into the process and then \nbasically walk out that door and go home. We don't have that debate \nthat allows us to have amendments and allows us to ultimately have a \nvote on the bill. It is cut off from a vote.\n  When you look at the past when it comes to voting rights, it has been \nbipartisan not even that long ago. But this time--this time--even \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, something that has been law of the \nland and supported on a bipartisan basis, as the President of the \nUnited States pointed out when he was in Atlanta--this time, no. Only \none Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, was willing even to allow \nthe John Lewis bill to come up for a vote.\n  But if our colleagues across the aisle will not work with us, it does \nnot mean--it cannot mean--that we should simply give up. A simple look \nat history makes that clear.\n  As Representative Clyburn has noted in recent weeks, there have been \nmoments in our history when this most fundamental of rights has not \nbeen extended or defended on a bipartisan basis; that is, the right to \nhave these bills come up. He pointed to the 15th Amendment. That, as he \nsaid, was a single-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote. \nThat fact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.\n  I would also say to my colleagues that the real threat facing our \ncountry isn't too much legislation; it is the gridlock and the \nstalemate in which this Chamber is stuck.\n  A number of us were just in Ukraine standing up for democracy, \nstanding up for the right of people across the world to be able to \ndebate issues and make decisions on the most pressing issues of this \ntime. Now we are back here in this Chamber, and we have to have that \nopportunity as well.\n  This misses another key point in the arguments made against changing \nthe rules. When politicians actually have to vote on stuff, voters can \nhold them accountable for these votes.\n  We know that the policies in the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act \nenjoy strong support among the American people. They have been adopted \nin red, blue, and purple States.\n  Look at places like Utah, where for years there has been mail-in \nballoting. Yet, in other States, sadly, it is really hard to do. In \nother States, you have to get a notary just to get an application or \nyou have to get a witness just to get an application even if you have \nCOVID and you are in a hospital. Yet, in many States--red, blue, \npurple--this is in place.\n  We believe--those of us who support the Freedom to Vote Act--that in \nkeeping with the Constitution that says Congress can make or alter the \nlaws regarding Federal elections, that this should be the law of the \nland. It is constitutionally supported, and Americans, no matter what \ntheir ZIP Code, should have the right to vote in a safe way that is \nbest for them.\n\n  Arguing that Senate rules are more important than the right to vote \nignores the very history of this Nation. As Senator Angus King has \nreminded us, in 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge introduced a bill to ensure \nAfrican Americans in the South were not disenfranchised. The bill was \npassed in the House but was blocked by the Senate with a filibuster. \nLodge argued that the Senate should get rid of the filibuster, saying:\n\n       To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and \n     never vote is imbecile.\n\n  I think that kind of says it all quite directly.\n  The Senate chose not to change its rules, and due to repeated \nfilibusters in the years that followed, Congress couldn't pass \nlegislation to enforce the 15th Amendment until nearly 70 years later \nthrough the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n  We have also heard that allowing one party to insist on virtually \nunlimited debate so that you can't vote is an essential part of the \nSenate, but experts from both parties have said this isn't true.\n  Marty Gold, a respected expert on Senate rules who worked for \nRepublican Leader Howard Baker and was staff director of the Senate \nRules Committee, has written:\n\n       The possibility that a minority of Senators could hold \n     unlimited debate on a topic against the majority's will was \n     unknown [in] the first Senate.\n\n  Those are his words.\n  Others have argued that requiring a supermajority, as this filibuster \ndoes now, to pass legislation was an intentional effort to foster \ncompromise, but, again, the historical record simply doesn't back that \nup.\n  The Constitutional Convention heard but did not adopt a proposal to \nrequire a supermajority for legislation. The Framers explicitly decided \nto reserve supermajority requirements for things like constitutional \namendments, treaties, and impeachment.\n  To quote one of them, Benjamin Franklin wrote that a system where \n``the minority overpowers the majority'' would be ``contrary to the \ncommon practice of assemblies in all countries and ages.''\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison:\n\n       It is my principle that the will of the majority should \n     always prevail.\n\n  James Madison was a fierce defender of minority rights, but in 1834, \neven he wrote:\n\n       The vital Principle of Republican Government is . . . the \n     will of the majority.''\n\n  Listening to those words, does it really seem like the Framers of our \nConstitution envisioned a system where a minority of Senators could \nstand in the way of legislation and stop it altogether--stop the vote, \nstop the consideration, throw a wrench into the process, take it off \nthe rails--and then just walk out the door and go home? That is not \nwhat they envisioned.\n  I also want to be clear. Updating the Senate rules to meet the needs \nof this moment isn't some radical break with past precedence. \nThroughout the Senate's history, when faced with unrelenting \nobstruction from the minority, the majority has, in fact, changed the \nSenate rules to allow matters to conclude, to be voted on, not to hang \nin abeyance in perpetuity. In fact, since it was first established in \n1917, the cloture rule has been revised multiple times to make it \neasier to end debate and to force a vote.\n  Now, for friends watching at home, this is what it means: A cloture \nmotion is what allows Senators to bring something to a vote, and under \nthe current rules, it takes 60 Senators to open debate or to pass a \nbill.\n  Here are some examples of how the cloture rule has changed over time:\n  In 1949, cloture was extended to cover all issues pending before the \nSenate, not just bills.\n  In 1975, the vote threshold for cloture was reduced to three-fifths \nof all Senators.\n  In 1979, total postcloture debate was limited to 100 hours, and then \nit was limited again to 30 hours in 1986.\n  In the past decade, the cloture rule has been further reduced for \nvarious kinds of nominees, most recently by our Republican colleagues \nacross the aisle. This isn't something from 100 years ago. This isn't \nsomething from before we had cars and people were arriving here on \nhorseback. This just happened.\n  In addition to changes to the cloture rule itself, the Senate has put \nin place exceptions to the rule. In fact, over time, the Senate has \nestablished over 160 processes and statutes that allow a final vote \nwithout requiring 60 votes for cloture to end debate; in other words, \nyou get to a vote without the 60 votes.\n  As a result, we have expedited procedures, including--get this--\nreconciliation to pass spending and tax legislation; the Congressional \nReview Act to block regulations; disapproval of arms sales. I guess \nsomeone decided that was OK to do for less than 60 votes. Even \napproving compensation plans for commercial space accidents doesn't \nrequire 60 votes, my friends.\n\n  But while the 60-vote threshold was carved up 160 times so Senators \ncould pass things like tax cuts under President Trump, block \nregulations, and confirm Supreme Court Justices, when it comes to \nvoting rights, we are told that tradition and comity mean that we \nshould hug it tight--this old rule--throw voters under the Senate \ndesks, and go home.\n  It is no wonder that our Republican colleagues support for the 60-\nvote threshold rings hollow when their priorities, such as tax cuts and \na Supreme Court nominee, can be passed with a simple majority.\n  Time and time again, the majority in the U.S. Senate has had to \nchange the\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nrules to help pass major legislation. As Senator Merkley has noted time \nand time again, bills we have passed after the majority has modified \nthe rules include the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1977; funding for the \nSelective Service System in 1980; deficit reduction legislation in \n1985; a moratorium on listing new species under the Endangered Species \nAct in 1995; and a change made by the majority in 1996 to the \nreconciliation process, which paved the way for the 2001 and 2003 Bush \ntax cuts and the 2017 Trump tax cuts. When circumstances change, \nSenators have changed the rules time and time again.\n  All of this history clearly shows that the Senate rules are not \nchiseled in stone. That is probably a good thing because the people out \nthere need us to do our jobs. And maybe that is more important than \nsome archaic rule that someone is now abusing. They are not an outside \nforce, these rules, over which we have no control. They are our rules--\nthe Senators' rules, yes, but also the people's rules--written and \nchanged over the years by Senators representing the people of this \ncountry, just like the ones sitting in this Chamber today.\n  As we move forward, I want to make clear that I agree with my \ncolleagues who have said that we must keep the history of this \ninstitution in mind. By the way, I just gave you the history of this \ninstitution--160 carve-outs; time and time again when the rules have \nchanged. That is the true history of this institution.\n  History plainly allows for just this type of action that our \ndemocracy now demands. If we acknowledge the stakes when it comes to \nprotecting the freedom to vote, the cornerstone of our democracy, and \nwe acknowledge the history of the rules of this body, I am left with a \nsimple conclusion: We must update, change, and improve our rules to \nrestore the Senate and meet the moment of our times.\n  Our Nation was founded on the ideals of democracy, and we have seen \nfor ourselves in this building how we can't afford to take that for \ngranted. I certainly saw that this weekend in Ukraine. We cannot afford \nto take any democracy for granted.\n  The world is watching us--watching to see how America is taking on \nthe challenges of the 21st century, including the threats to our \ndemocracy. Around the globe, there are those who see weakness as an \nopportunity. They see weakness in our democracy as an opportunity for \nthem. Those who are hoping that gridlock and paralysis are the defining \nfeatures of America--they are out there, and you can imagine what world \nleaders I am thinking of right now.\n  To put it simply, if we are going to effectively compete with the \nrest of the world, we need a Senate that can do more than just respond \nto crises. We are pretty good at that--tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, \ntsunamis, financial crises, pandemics. OK. We respond to that. But what \nabout the long-term challenges that slowly but surely are eroding this \ndemocracy with voter suppression? There is so much at stake here. We \nmust get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of Senator Portman, the Senate recess until 6:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-01-23"}

Mr. President, I know we are expecting a vote soon \nhere, and I know that our colleagues know that we will have two votes--\none on a nominee and the second one on a motion to proceed to what has \nbeen known as the Innovation and Competition Act. I just wanted to say, \nbecause I know there have been a few people out here on the floor--and \nI won't spend a lot of time now--that, hopefully, we will proceed on \nthe motion to proceed and that we will have a much larger discussion.\n  I do want to clarify that today's vote is really about whether we are \ngoing to stop shipping jobs overseas and instead invest in American \nR&D. If we invest in American R&D, then we will see the plant, like is \nbeing talked about in Ohio, get built instead of getting immediately \nbuilt in Europe. We will see other companies make investments in States \nlike Texas and Arizona and Idaho and in many other parts of the United \nStates. We will help build an ecosystem here in the United States of \ntechnology and next-generation development.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for a bill that makes an investment \nand competes with the next-generation semiconductors so that we can go \neven faster with innovation than we are currently doing because so much \nof that development is happening overseas. It is happening in Taiwan, \nand it is happening in Korea. They have had ``game on'' for a while. \nThey have had ``game on'' and have literally taken a page out of what \nthe United States has done to attract and keep industry here. \nInnovation is in the DNA of Americans, and if we want to create the \neconomy of the future, we need to invest in the R&D of today. That \nmeans passing this next motion to proceed, getting on the bill, and \npassing as much of it as we can today. That way, we can be assured that \nwe are not going to lose out in this round of investment that is, yes, \nvery challenging on a global basis.\n  We should be really realistic. We have a chip shortage today, and it \nis costing our economy, and it is increasing inflation. We know that \nthere is going to be a chip demand that is going to be threefold from \nwhere we are today in the very near future. That means, if we don't \nstart building here, we are not going to catch up. More importantly is \nthe national security element of making sure that the United States is \nmaking the most advanced semiconductors.\n  So today's vote is to say to our colleagues that we believe in the \nR&D ecosystem of the United States--we believe in the NSF; we believe \nin our universities; we believe in the DOE--and that we believe that we \ncan do translational science and help our manufacturing base be more \ncompetitive whether it is autos or airplanes or other aspects of the \ntech sector.\n  This underlying bill invests in 10 key technology areas that we need \nto make investments in, and it makes sure that we in the United States \nof America are saying: We want to see that innovation here. We want to \nsee these in tech hubs and in tech centers. We want our universities to \ntranslate that science faster and keep our patents and make sure that \nwe are, obviously, continuing to lead the world in innovation. If we \nfail to do this, I guarantee you that more jobs are going to go \noverseas.\n  American R&D can create the hub of innovation that we would like to \nsee for the future. We have done it many times over. We just need to \nproceed to make sure that we are aware of the competition that exists \naround the globe. The United States is up to it; it is capable of \ncompeting; and this institution is also capable of making decisions and \nproceeding by working together. Trust me. That is what people are \nlooking at around the world. Whether they are in Europe or Asia, they \nwant to know whether we know how to get things done.\n  Let's show them that American innovation is here to stay; that it is \nthe top of the game; and that we can compete with anyone given the \nright investments in STEM, job training, education, and in taking that \necosystem that is so unique and making an investment in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-28"}

DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY OF UNTRUSTED \n                   COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act \n     of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(s) Disclosure of Certain Activities Related to Untrusted \n     Telecommunications Equipment.--\n\n[[Page H7991]]\n\n       ``(1) In general.--Each issuer required to file an annual \n     or quarterly report under subsection (a) shall disclose in \n     that report the information required in paragraph (2) if, \n     during the period covered by the report, the issuer or any \n     affiliate of the issuer used or contracted to use covered \n     telecommunications equipment or services.\n       ``(2) Information required.--If an issuer or affiliate of \n     the issuer has engaged in an activity described in paragraph \n     (1), the issuer shall disclose such activity, including a \n     detailed description of--\n       ``(A) whether the covered telecommunications equipment or \n     services are being used in a mobile network run by the \n     issuer, and whether those equipment or services were used in \n     the core or periphery of the network;\n       ``(B) whether the covered telecommunications equipment or \n     services were used for cloud computing or data storage;\n       ``(C) whether any covered telecommunications equipment or \n     services were replaced with other vendors; and\n       ``(D) whether the issuer is currently engaging in \n     negotiations or planning to contract to use additional \n     covered telecommunications equipment or services.\n       ``(3) Notice of disclosures.--If an issuer reports under \n     paragraph (1) that the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer \n     has knowingly engaged in any activity described in that \n     paragraph, the issuer shall separately file with the \n     Commission, concurrently with the annual or quarterly report \n     under subsection (a), a notice that the disclosure of that \n     activity has been included in that annual or quarterly report \n     that identifies the issuer and contains the information \n     required by paragraph (2).\n       ``(4) Public disclosure of information.--Upon receiving a \n     notice under paragraph (3) that an annual or quarterly report \n     includes a disclosure of an activity described in paragraph \n     (1), the Commission shall promptly--\n       ``(A) transmit the report to--\n       ``(i) the President;\n       ``(ii) the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Energy and \n     Commerce, and Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       ``(iii) the Committees on Foreign Relations, Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, and Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate; and\n       ``(B) make the information provided in the disclosure and \n     the notice available to the public by posting the information \n     on the Internet website of the Commission.\n       ``(5) Covered telecommunications equipment or service \n     defined.--In this subsection, the term `covered \n     telecommunications equipment or service' has the meaning \n     given to the term `covered communications equipment or \n     service' in section 9 of the Secure and Trusted \n     Communications Network Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 1608).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect with respect to reports required to be \n     filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Covered telecommunications equipment or service; \n     untrusted telecommunications equipment or service.--The terms \n     ``covered telecommunications equipment or service'' and \n     ``untrusted telecommunications equipment or service'' have \n     the meaning given to the term ``covered communications \n     equipment or service'' in section 9 of the Secure and Trusted \n     Communications Network Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 1608).\n       (2) Trusted telecommunications equipment or service.--The \n     term ``trusted telecommunications equipment or service'' \n     means any telecommunications equipment or service that is not \n     a covered telecommunications equipment or service.\n\n Urging the European Union to Designate Hizballah in Its Entirety as a \n                         Terrorist Organization\n\n                              H. Res. 558\n\n       Whereas, in April 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against \n     the United States Embassy in Beirut killed 63 people;\n       Whereas, in October 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against \n     the United States Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed \n     241 American and 58 French servicemembers supporting the \n     Multinational Force peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas, in July 2012, a Hizballah terror attack, carried \n     out by an operative with dual Lebanese-French citizenship, in \n     Burgas, Bulgaria, killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bulgarian;\n       Whereas, in March 2013, a Swedish-Lebanese Hizballah \n     operative in Cyprus was convicted of planning terror attacks \n     against Israeli tourists;\n       Whereas, in June 2015, a Hizballah operative was sentenced \n     to 6 years in prison after he stockpiled more than 8 tons of \n     ammonium nitrate in Cyprus;\n       Whereas the Hizballah International Financing Prevention \n     Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) and the Hizballah \n     International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018 \n     (Public Law 115-272) broadened financial sector sanctions \n     against Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to \n     refrain from supporting the terrorist group;\n       Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of the Treasury \n     imposed sanctions on Abdullah Safi-Al-Din, Hizballah's \n     representative to Iran, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah \n     financier, and blacklisted 5 of Bazzi's companies, including \n     Belgian energy services conglomerate Global Trading Group NV;\n       Whereas, in October 2018, French police raided the Islamic \n     Zahra Centre on suspicion of supporting Hizballah, freezing \n     the organization's funds, and seizing illegal weapons;\n       Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former leaders of the Zahra \n     Centre France were arrested on suspicion of continuing to run \n     the association;\n       Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of the Treasury \n     designated 2 Hizballah-backed members of Lebanese Parliament, \n     Amin Sherri and Muhammad Hasan Ra'd, and Hizballah security \n     official Wafiq Safa, stating that Hizballah uses its \n     operatives in parliament to advance its violent activities;\n       Whereas, as of April 2020, Germany believed there to be \n     1,050 people with suspected links to Hizballah in the \n     country;\n       Whereas Europol's June 2020 European Union Terrorism \n     Situation and Trend Report outlined that Hizballah is \n     ``suspected of trafficking diamonds and drugs and of money \n     laundering via the trade in second-hand cars'', and the \n     report also stated that ``investigations face the difficulty \n     of demonstrating that the funds collected are channeled to \n     the military wing of the organization'';\n       Whereas United States-led Project Cassandra and Operation \n     Cedar exposed the criminal-business wing of Hizballah, the \n     Business Affairs Component (BAC) of Hezbollah's External \n     Security Organization;\n       Whereas, during Project Cassandra, Hizballah elements \n     involved in drug trafficking were arrested in the United \n     States, South America, and several European countries, \n     including France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy;\n       Whereas Hizballah's criminal activity in Europe is run by \n     the BAC, which reports to the External Security Organisation, \n     also known as Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Organization, \n     and Abdallah Safieddine, Hizballah's representative in Iran, \n     is also involved in this activity;\n       Whereas, in August 2020, United Nations Secretary General \n     Guterres called on Lebanon to disarm Hizballah, citing the \n     terror group's persistent violation of Resolution 1701 \n     (2006);\n       Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of Hizballah, harboring, \n     financing, training, and arming the group;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury and Department of \n     State estimate that Iran provides as much as $700,000,000 per \n     year to Hizballah in the form of financial and logistical \n     support, weapons, and training;\n       Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately \n     150,000 missiles and rockets, many of which can reach deep \n     into Israel;\n       Whereas Hizballah fighters have been supporting the Assad \n     regime in Syria, often leading operations in the conflict \n     which has left more than 500,000 dead;\n       Whereas Hizballah's destabilizing actions in Syria have \n     contributed to a migrant crisis that has brought over 700,000 \n     refugees to Europe;\n       Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for militias \n     in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region and \n     perpetuating violence in those countries;\n       Whereas Hizballah activities continue to plague Lebanon \n     with profound economic and political instability and \n     violence;\n       Whereas, in August 2020, at least 220 people died and \n     thousands more were injured when a massive stockpile of \n     ammonium nitrate exploded in Beirut's port;\n       Whereas Hizballah's cross border illicit arms and drugs \n     trafficking undermines the Lebanese Armed Forces, the \n     legitimate security establishment of the country as outlined \n     in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006);\n       Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy Secretary \n     General Naim Qassem stated that ``[Hizballah does not] have a \n     military wing and a political one . . . Every element of \n     Hizballah, from commanders to members as well as our various \n     capabilities, are in the service of the resistance'';\n       Whereas the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the \n     Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia, \n     and Kosovo, among others, have designated Hizballah in its \n     entirety as a terror organization;\n       Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council \n     formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a terrorist \n     organization, and the League of Arab States shortly \n     thereafter adopted the same designation;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury has diligently added \n     persons and entities to the list of Specially Designated \n     Global Terrorists who have provided material support to the \n     Hizballah terrorist organization, thereby hampering its \n     financing and logistical capabilities;\n       Whereas the European Union, in July 2013, designated \n     Hizballah's so-called ``military wing'', but not the \n     organization as a whole, as a terrorist organization;\n       Whereas, despite restrictions put on Hizballah since the \n     designation of its military wing, the group continues to \n     conduct illicit narcotrafficking, money laundering, and \n     weapons trafficking throughout Europe and the world; and\n       Whereas the House of Representatives has previously called \n     on the European Union to fully designate Hizballah as a \n     terrorist organization, passing House Resolution 359 in \n     October 2017: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) applauds and expresses support for the continued, \n     increased cooperation between\n\n[[Page H7992]]\n\n     the United States and the European Union (EU) in thwarting \n     Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities;\n       (2) supports transcontinental efforts within Europe to \n     share intelligence information among police and security \n     services to facilitate greater cooperation in tracking, \n     apprehending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign fighters, \n     and potential offenders;\n       (3) encourages the European Union to implement sanctions \n     against Hizballah-affiliated terrorists in tandem with the \n     United States;\n       (4) recommends greater civil society engagement in both the \n     United States and Europe to underscore Hizballah's malign \n     regional influence; and\n       (5) urges the European Union to designate Hizballah in its \n     entirety as a terrorist organization and increase pressure on \n     the group, including through--\n       (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation between \n     European Union members in combating Hizballah;\n       (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active \n     supporters of Hizballah;\n       (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, including those \n     masquerading as charities; and\n       (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of \n     Hizballah.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 2 of House Resolution \n1361, the ordering of the yeas and nays on postponed motions to suspend \nthe rules with respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all \nsuch motions are considered as withdrawn.\n  The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Maryland \n(Mr. Hoyer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bills and \nagree to the resolution.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Invasion War Crimes \n     Deterrence and Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and \n     unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine that commenced on \n     February 24, 2022, the military of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation under the direction of President Vladimir \n     Putin has committed war crimes that include--\n       (A) the deliberate targeting of civilians and injuring or \n     killing of noncombatants;\n       (B) the deliberate targeting and attacking of hospitals, \n     schools, and other non-military buildings dedicated to \n     religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, such as the \n     bombing of a theater in Mariupol that served as a shelter for \n     noncombatants and had the word ``children'' written clearly \n     in the Russian language outside;\n       (C) the indiscriminate bombardment of undefended dwellings \n     and buildings;\n       (D) the wanton destruction of property not justified by \n     military necessity;\n       (E) unlawful civilian deportations;\n       (F) the taking of hostages; and\n       (G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse;\n       (2) the use of chemical weapons by the Government of the \n     Russian Federation in Ukraine would constitute a war crime, \n     and engaging in any military preparations to use chemical \n     weapons or to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain chemical \n     weapons is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, to \n     which the Russian Federation is a signatory;\n       (3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of committing acts of \n     aggression, systematic abuses of human rights, and acts that \n     constitute war crimes or other atrocities both at home and \n     abroad, and the brutality and scale of these actions, \n     including in the Russian Federation republic of Chechnya, \n     Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, demonstrate the extent to which \n     his regime is willing to flout international norms and values \n     in the pursuit of its objectives;\n       (4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanctioned the use of \n     chemical weapons at home and abroad, including in the \n     poisonings of Russian spy turned double agent Sergei Skripal \n     and his daughter Yulia and leading Russian opposition figure \n     Aleksey Navalny, and aided and abetted the use of chemical \n     weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and\n       (5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian Federation \n     initiated its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine \n     which resulted in its illegal occupation of Crimea, the \n     unrecognized declaration of independence by the so-called \n     ``Donetsk People's Republic'' and ``Luhansk People's \n     Republic'' by Russia-backed proxies, and numerous human \n     rights violations and deaths of civilians in Ukraine.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and \n     information related to war crimes and other atrocities \n     committed during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine \n     that began on February 24, 2022, for use in appropriate \n     domestic, foreign, and international courts and tribunals \n     prosecuting those responsible for such crimes;\n       (2) to help deter the commission of war crimes and other \n     atrocities in Ukraine by publicizing to the maximum possible \n     extent, including among Russian and other foreign military \n     commanders and troops in Ukraine, efforts to identify and \n     prosecute those responsible for the commission of war crimes \n     during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that began \n     on February 24, 2022; and\n       (3) to continue efforts to identify, deter, and pursue \n     accountability for war crimes and other atrocities committed \n     around the world and by other perpetrators, and to leverage \n     international cooperation and best practices in this regard \n     with respect to the current situation in Ukraine.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Daniel Anderl Judicial \n     Security and Privacy Act of 2021''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Members of the Federal judiciary perform the important \n     function of interpreting the Constitution of the United \n     States and administering justice in a fair and impartial \n     manner.\n       (2) In recent years, partially as a result of the rise in \n     the use of social media and online access to information, \n     members of the Federal judiciary have been exposed to an \n     increased number of personal threats in connection to their \n     role. The ease of access to free or inexpensive sources of \n     covered information has considerably lowered the effort \n     required for malicious actors to discover where individuals \n     live and where they spend leisure hours and to find \n     information about their family members. Such threats have \n     included calling a judge a traitor with references to mass \n     shootings and serial killings, a murder attempt on a justice \n     of the Supreme Court of the United States, calling for an \n     ``angry mob'' to gather outside a home of a judge and, in \n     reference to a judge on the court of appeals of the United \n     States, stating how easy it would be to ``get them''.\n       (3) Between 2015 and 2019, threats and other inappropriate \n     communications against Federal judges and other judiciary \n     personnel increased from 926 in 2015 to approximately 4,449 \n     in 2019.\n       (4) Over the past decade, several members of the Federal \n     judiciary have experienced acts of violence against \n     themselves or a family member in connection to their Federal \n     judiciary role, including the murder in 2005 of the family of \n     Joan Lefkow, a judge for the United States District Court for \n     the Northern District of Illinois.\n       (5) On Sunday July 19, 2020, an assailant went to the home \n     of Esther Salas, a judge for the United States District Court \n     for the District of New Jersey, impersonating a package \n     delivery driver, opening fire upon arrival, and killing \n     Daniel Anderl, the 20-year-old only son of Judge Salas, and \n     seriously wounding Mark Anderl, her husband.\n       (6) In the aftermath of the recent tragedy that occurred to \n     Judge Salas and in response to the continuous rise of threats \n     against members of the Federal judiciary, there is an \n     immediate need for enhanced security procedures and increased \n     availability of tools to protect Federal judges and their \n     families.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to improve the \n     safety and security of Federal judges, including senior, \n     recalled, or retired Federal judges, and their immediate \n     family members to ensure Federal judges are able to \n     administer justice fairly without fear of personal reprisal \n     from individuals affected by the decisions they make in the \n     course of carrying out their public duties.\n\n     SEC. __03.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to carry out certain activities to improve recycling \nand composting programs in the United States, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, alongside \nthe Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, and the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mrs. Capito, the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act.\n  This bill is the result of true collaboration and reflects a \nsubstantial amount of bipartisan effort to address our Nation's \nrecycling and composting challenges. This bill aims to improve the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's ability to gather data on our \nNation's recycling systems and explore opportunities for implementing a \nnational composting strategy.\n  The availability of good data is one of the major challenges facing \nthe public and private sector as they work make investments to improve \nour recycling systems. Upgrading recycling infrastructure, expanding \nrecycling services, and increasing recycling education will all benefit \nfrom the availability of better data.\n  Specifically, this bill will create a comprehensive database of all \ncurbside recycling and composting programs nationwide. It will also \nassess the materials those programs collect and their rates of \ncontamination. The bill will also look at barriers communities and \nindividuals face when trying to access recycling and composting \nservices.\n  In addition to that, the bill will ask the EPA to study the end \nmarket sale of recyclable and compostable materials. It also directs \nthe EPA to develop a way to measure how otherwise recyclable materials \nare being lost from the circular market. The reports from both of these \nstudies will be immeasurably helpful to stakeholders, communities, and \nlocal and State governments.\n  As part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress \nprovided unprecedented levels of funding for recycling infrastructure \nand educational programs. The bill I am introducing today represents \nour next step in building on these efforts--to turn the challenges of \nrecycling and composting into opportunities to reduce planet-warming \nemissions and create good-paying jobs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 674\n\n       Whereas, after World War II, the infrastructure, factories, \n     and cities of Europe were in ruins and the people of Europe \n     were in danger of famine and destitution;\n       Whereas, in a commencement address on June 5, 1947, at \n     Harvard University, then-Secretary of State George C. \n     Marshall proposed the framework of the Economic Recovery \n     Program (commonly known as the ``Marshall Plan'');\n       Whereas, in his address, Secretary Marshall declared that \n     the Marshall Plan would be successful only with ``foresight, \n     and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the \n     vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our \n     country'';\n       Whereas a bipartisan coalition of Congress overwhelmingly \n     approved the Marshall Plan through the passage of the \n     Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, which was signed by \n     President Harry Truman on April 3, 1948;\n       Whereas, in that Act, Congress acknowledged that the \n     ``intimate economic and other relationships between the \n     United States and the nations of Europe'' and recognized that \n     peace and general welfare on the European continent are in \n     the national interest of the United States;\n       Whereas the Marshall Plan helped rebuild a battered Europe, \n     restore peace and political stability, and reinforce \n     democracy across the continent;\n       Whereas, under the Marshall Plan, the United States \n     extended an offer of aid to all countries in Europe, without \n     prejudice, including to the then-Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics;\n       Whereas the Marshall Pan served as the foundation for \n     transatlantic engagement and cooperation, which led to the \n     establishment of the Organization for Economic Cooperation \n     and Development (OECD) and the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas continued Euro-Atlantic integration and cooperation \n     are key to the protection of peace and transatlantic values;\n       Whereas the brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by \n     Vladimir Putin, launched on February 24, 2022, threatens the \n     peace and principles at the core of the transatlantic \n     community;\n       Whereas continued transatlantic cooperation is vital to \n     holding Vladimir Putin to account for his war of choice \n     against the Ukrainian people, and supporting Ukraine as it \n     defends its sovereignty and territorial integrity amidst \n     unconscionable war crimes committed by the Armed Forces of \n     the Russian Federation;\n       Whereas the United States, in cooperation with its allies \n     and partners, is committed to helping rebuild and protect the \n     democratic Government of Ukraine;\n       Whereas direct investment in the United States by European \n     countries exceeds trillions of dollars annually, which is a \n     direct result of the prosperous economy in Europe that was \n     aided by investments of the United States; and\n       Whereas the German Marshall Fund of the United States, \n     which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2022, was \n     established with a gift from Germany to express appreciation \n     for the support the United States provided to Europe in the \n     aftermath of World War II: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Economic \n     Recovery Program (commonly known as the ``Marshall Plan'');\n       (2) recognizes the role of the Marshall Plan in founding a \n     transatlantic community committed to the preservation of \n     peace, prosperity, and democracy;\n       (3) reaffirms that cooperation with allies and partners in \n     the transatlantic community to protect shared values and \n     principles is in the national interest of the United States; \n     and\n       (4) congratulates the German Marshall Fund of the United \n     States on its 50th anniversary and expresses appreciation for \n     its work to champion cooperation between the United States \n     and allies and partners in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-06-22"}

Mr. President, President Biden's proposal for fiscal \n2023 was a massive real-dollar increase for liberal domestic spending \nand a significant real-dollar cut for our national defense. Thanks to \nthe tireless work from Senator Shelby and a number of\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\nour colleagues, the Government funding bill that we will be taking up \nthis week does exactly--exactly the reverse of what the Biden \nadministration asked for. This bill will significantly grow the \nbaseline for defense and significantly cut the baseline for nondefense, \nnonveterans, after inflation, a big real-dollar increase in the defense \nbaseline, and a big real-dollar cut for the nondefense, nonveterans \nbaseline. This is an impressive outcome for the Republican negotiators; \nand, more importantly, it is the outcome that our country actually \nneeds to keep helping Ukraine and our other friends, to keep out-\ninnovating and out-competing Russia and China and to keep our brave men \nand women in uniform equipped with the best training tools and \ntechnologies the world has ever seen.\n  The administration's original version for the Federal budget--\nstarving defense while shoveling cash into miscellaneous domestic \nspending--was so out of whack that Democrats in Congress actually \njoined us in rejecting it.\n  Then there was some discussion that Democrats might only agree to \nmake sufficient investments in our Armed Forces if they got to jack up \ndomestic spending even higher as compensation. Of course, that didn't \nmake any sense either. The Commander in Chief's own political party \ndoes not get to take our troops hostage in order to demand even more \nunrelated goodies.\n  The Republicans' position all along was quite simple: Defending \nAmerica and out-competing our rivals is a fundamental governing duty. \nIt is the basic business that we are supposed to take care of, not \nsomething for which Democrats get special rewards. And that is \nprecisely what is finally happening. Compared to where the negotiators \nstarted, we transferred huge sums of money away from Democrats' \nspending wish list, toward our national defense and Armed Forces, but \nwithout allowing the overall cost of the package to go any higher.\n  There is no question that an omnibus spending bill less than 1 week \nbefore Christmas is not the right way to run the appropriations process \nor the Senate Chamber. Things should be done differently--more \nresponsibly, with more foresight and more planning.\n  And when Republicans controlled the majority, things were, in fact, \ndone differently--more responsibly, with more foresight. When \nRepublicans last controlled both chambers, we worked to conduct a more \nnormal appropriations process. The subcommittees were more empowered to \ndo their work. We worked to break things into multiple bills and move \nminibuses across the Senate floor before the 11th hour.\n  Instead, as Republicans spent this whole year calling on the \nDemocratic leader to prioritize his basic responsibilities like \ngovernment funding and the NDAA, this majority spent literally month \nafter month chasing shiny objects while procrastinating on core duties.\n  So I share many of my colleagues' dissatisfaction with the \ndysfunctional Democratic-run process that has brought us here. But, \nunfortunately, as we stand here today, going back in time and forcing \nDemocrats to spend the last 11 months running the Senate more \nresponsibly is certainly not an option. From where we stand today, \nthere are literally two options before us: No. 1, we can pass this \nbill, give our servicemembers and commanders the resources they need, \nflip the President's broken budget request on its head and actually cut \nbaseline, nondefense, nonveterans spending in real dollars while we are \nat it; or we can fail to pass this bill and give our Armed Forces \nconfusion and uncertainty while the Chinese Communist Party continues \nto help their military commanders pour money into new research and new \nweapons.\n  Between the two actual options before us, this is not a close call. \nThe Senate should pass this bill.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-12-24"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Countering Economic \n     Coercion Act of 2022''.\n\n     SEC. 1282. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The following is the sense of Congress:\n       (1) Foreign adversaries are increasingly using economic \n     coercion to pressure, punish, and influence United States \n     allies and partners.\n       (2) Economic coercion causes economic harm to United States \n     allies and partners and creates malign influence on the \n     sovereign political actions of such allies and partners.\n       (3) Economic coercion of United States allies and partners \n     has negative effects on the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (4) Economic coercion is often characterized by--\n       (A) arbitrary and discriminatory actions that seek to \n     interfere with sovereign actions, violate international trade \n     rules, and run counter to the rules-based international \n     order;\n       (B) capricious and non-transparent actions taken without \n     due process afforded;\n       (C) intimidation or threats of punitive actions; and\n       (D) informal actions that take place without explicit \n     government action.\n       (5) Recent acts of economic coercion have included \n     instances in which foreign adversaries have--\n       (A) acted in a capricious and non-transparent manner to \n     prevent or dissuade consumers from purchasing imports from a \n     foreign trading partner;\n       (B) enacted discriminatory administrative fees or technical \n     barriers to trade in goods and services in response to \n     sovereign political actions taken by a foreign trading \n     partner;\n       (C) arbitrarily restricted market access or otherwise \n     limited the import of goods or services from a foreign \n     trading partner;\n       (D) arbitrarily restricted investment in or export of goods \n     or services to a foreign trading partner; and\n       (E) acted in a non-transparent manner to manipulate a \n     private entity with the intent of causing economic harm to or \n     influencing sovereign political actions of a foreign trading \n     partner.\n       (6) Existing mechanisms for trade dispute resolution and \n     international arbitration are inadequate for responding to \n     economic coercion in a timely and effective manner as foreign \n     adversaries exploit plausible deniability and lengthy \n     processes to evade accountability.\n       (7) The United States should provide material support to \n     foreign trading partners affected by economic coercion.\n       (8) Supporting foreign trading partners affected by \n     economic coercion can lead to opportunities for United States \n     businesses, investors, and workers to reach new markets and \n     customers.\n       (9) Responding to economic coercion will be most effective \n     when the United States provides relief to affected foreign \n     trading partners in coordination with allies and like-minded \n     countries.\n       (10) Such coordination will further demonstrate broad \n     resolve against economic coercion.\n\n     SEC. 1283.

Mr. President, I feel like the Senator from West \nVirginia right now.\n  I am very glad that we are going to be passing these two recycling \nbills.\n  I will just briefly say I am the cosponsor of the bipartisan \nRecycling and Infrastructure Accessibility Act. Sometimes the simplest \nthings that we can do have such great impacts, and I think that is what \nwe are going to see here today.\n  In rural America, we don't have the accessibility to recycling and \nthe infrastructure that we need, and that is the point of my bill. It \nhelps us, obviously, protect our environment, supports jobs, and it \nhelps our municipalities and others be able to sustain these.\n  This is a pilot program that would give Federal support for recycling \ninfrastructure projects, such as transfer stations and dropoff \nfacilities. That is the difficulty; you can't have one in every small \ntown. You need to have a spoke-and-hub sort of system, and that is what \nthis is looking at.\n  I will speed it up here. I want to thank all the different \norganizations and groups that have helped: The National Water Resources \nAssociation, the Plastics Industry Association, the American Beverage \nAssociation, our associated staffs, and particularly the chair of the \nfull committee. He has been just a champion here in working on the \nrecycling bills. He is the main sponsor of the Recycling Composting \nAccountability Act, of which I am also a cosponsor.\n  These will fill great and important data gaps. These are recycling \nbills that were reported out by voice votes so we have unanimous \nconsent by our committee. I am glad that our colleagues have agreed to \npass them.\n\n\n                                S. 3742\n\n  So I will move on and say, as if in legislative session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 357, S. 3742.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3742) to establish a pilot grant program to \n     improve recycling accessibility, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read \na third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3742) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 3742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Recycling Infrastructure and \n     Accessibility Act of 2022''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       (B) loads the recyclable material onto tractor trailers, \n     railcars, or barges for transport to a distant materials \n     recovery facility or another recycling-related facility.\n       (9) Underserved community.--The term ``underserved \n     community'' means a community, including an unincorporated \n     area, without access to full recycling services because--\n       (A) transportation, distance, or other reasons render \n     utilization of available processing capacity at an existing \n     materials recovery facility cost prohibitive; or\n       (B) the processing capacity of an existing materials \n     recovery facility is insufficient to manage the volume of \n     recyclable materials produced by that community.\n       (b) Establishment.--Not later than 18 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall establish a \n     pilot grant program, to be known as the ``Recycling \n     Infrastructure and Accessibility Program'', to award grants, \n     on a competitive basis, to eligible entities to improve \n     recycling accessibility in a community or communities within \n     the same geographic area.\n       (c) Goal.--The goal of the pilot grant program is to fund \n     eligible projects that will significantly improve \n     accessibility to recycling systems through investments in \n     infrastructure in underserved communities through the use of \n     a hub-and-spoke model for recycling infrastructure \n     development.\n       (d) Applications.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     the pilot grant program, an eligible entity shall submit to \n     the Administrator an application at such time, in such \n     manner, and containing such information as the Administrator \n     may require.\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\n       (e) Considerations.--In selecting eligible entities to \n     receive a grant under the pilot grant program, the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (1) whether the community or communities in which the \n     eligible entity is seeking to carry out a proposed project \n     has curbside recycling;\n       (2) whether the proposed project of the eligible entity \n     will improve accessibility to recycling services in a single \n     underserved community or multiple underserved communities; \n     and\n       (3) if the eligible entity is a public-private partnership, \n     the financial health of the private entity seeking to enter \n     into that public-private partnership.\n       (f) Priority.--In selecting eligible entities to receive a \n     grant under the pilot grant program, the Administrator shall \n     give priority to eligible entities seeking to carry out a \n     proposed project in a community in which there is not more \n     than 1 materials recovery facility within a 75-mile radius of \n     that community.\n       (g) Use of Funds.--An eligible entity awarded a grant under \n     the pilot grant program may use the grant funds for projects \n     to improve recycling accessibility in communities, including \n     in underserved communities, by--\n       (1) increasing the number of transfer stations;\n       (2) expanding curbside recycling collection programs where \n     appropriate; and\n       (3) leveraging public-private partnerships to reduce the \n     costs associated with collecting and transporting recyclable \n     materials in underserved communities.\n       (h) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--An eligible entity \n     awarded a grant under the pilot grant program may not use the \n     grant funds for projects relating to recycling education \n     programs.\n       (i) Minimum and Maximum Grant Amount.--A grant awarded to \n     an eligible entity under the pilot grant program shall be in \n     an amount--\n       (1) not less than $500,000; and\n       (2) not more than $15,000,000.\n       (j) Set-Aside.--The Administrator shall set aside not less \n     than 70 percent of the amounts made available to carry out \n     the pilot grant program for each fiscal year to award grants \n     to eligible entities to carry out a proposed project or \n     program in a single underserved community or multiple \n     underserved communities.\n       (k) Federal Share.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Federal \n     share of the cost of a project or program carried out by an \n     eligible entity using grant funds shall be not more than 90 \n     percent.\n       (2) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive the Federal share \n     requirement under paragraph (1) if the Administrator \n     determines that an eligible entity would experience \n     significant financial hardship as a result of that \n     requirement.\n       (l) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date on which \n     the first grant is awarded under the pilot grant program, the \n     Administrator shall submit to Congress a report describing \n     the implementation of the pilot grant program, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a list of eligible entities that have received a grant \n     under the pilot grant program;\n       (2) the actions taken by each eligible entity that received \n     a grant under the pilot grant program to improve recycling \n     accessibility with grant funds; and\n       (3) to the extent information is available, a description \n     of how grant funds received under the pilot grant program \n     improved recycling rates in each community in which a project \n     or program was carried out under the pilot grant program.\n       (m) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Administrator to carry out the pilot grant program such \n     sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2023 \n     through 2027, to remain available until expended.\n       (2) Administrative costs and technical assistance.--Of the \n     amounts made available under paragraph (1), the Administrator \n     may use up to 5 percent--\n       (A) for administrative costs relating to carrying out the \n     pilot grant program; and\n       (B) to provide technical assistance to eligible entities \n     applying for a grant under the pilot grant program.\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Boozman, who is a \ncharter member of the Senate Recycling Caucus, be recognized to speak \non behalf of these measures, which he has played a key role on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mr. Chairman \nand Ranking Member Capito, for your leadership in that this area.\n  As has been said and should be said many times more, we appreciate \nthe great work of our staffs in getting this done.\n  The other thing that is so important is the answers to our problems \nneed to come from the ground up. Through the Recycling Caucus and \nhearings, and the list goes on and on, this is where those answers were \ngenerated--from the people who are out fighting the battles.\n  We talk a lot about the lack of bipartisanship and things. This is a \ngreat example of people working together for the common good up here.\n  It is great for the environment in the sense that recycling is not \njust gathering. We don't want to have a situation continuing, like we \ndo now, where so much of that that is gathered actually winds up in the \nlandfill eventually.\n  Conservation is the low-hanging fruit. You know, it makes all the \nsense in the world to reuse things. It creates a situation where we \nlessen the dependence on landfills, things like that. And then, again, \nin this age of globalization and things, we really do need to use the \nresources that we have and then continue to use the resources as we go \nforward.\n  So we are talking about jobs. We are talking about the environment. \nAnd, for that reason, I very much support and appreciate, as I said, \nthe leadership of the chairman and the ranking member for their great \neffort in pushing this forward.\n  And, with that, I yield the floor to Senator Cardin--Mr. Chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I just want to say again my thanks to--I \nthink I am pretty rabid on recycling, but this fellow from Arkansas is \nright there with me. I appreciate very much both your leadership and \nSenator Capito's.\n  I think we are going to shift gears here. We just passed two very \nsignificant recycling bills for our country. This is something that I \nam thrilled about, and I know Senator Capito is as well. And we are \ngoing to shift gears and take some time to consider other important \nlegislation: the Water Resources Development Act.\n  Senator Cardin, who chairs the subcommittee, has jurisdiction on the \nwater resources bill.

Under the previous order, the time until 5 \np.m. is equally divided.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise to discuss helping our \nservicemembers exposed to toxic burn pits.\n  For days now, servicemembers and their families have been camping \noutside this very building in desperation. They are pleading with us, \nthey are begging us to pass this bill. They have been out there all \nweekend in 90-degree heat, sheltering themselves from thunderstorms, as \nwell as oppressive humidity. I have been down there to visit them three \ntimes now, and I can tell you, they are exhausted. They miss their \nfamilies. They want to go home, but they will not. They will not go \nhome until the job is done because the suffering they are enduring now \npales in comparison to the suffering they, their fellow veterans, or \ntheir fellow family members experience every day because of the \ninjuries sustained because of the exposure to the toxins released at \nthese burn pits.\n  Last week, before it became clear that the PACT Act would fail, these \nfamilies came to DC ready to celebrate. The mother-in-law of SFC Heath \nRobinson, who died because of burn pits, came with Heath's daughter \nBrielle, who was excited to finally celebrate her father's legacy \nfinally coming to fruition. Instead, we had to explain to a crying 9-\nyear-old girl why this would not be happening, why the Senate had \nfailed them.\n  So I don't want anyone to just listen to me rattle off a bunch of \nstatistics or facts about burn pits; I want you to listen to these \npeople, the families, people who are literally giving every ounce of \ntheir being in service to this country, people with families, people \nwith kids, people who are willing to upend their lives at the very \nmoment's notice to fight for the values that make us who we are. \nInstead, when their lungs were filled with toxins, the government \nturned its back on them when they needed us the most. We made a promise \nto them to care for them when they came home, and that promise has been \nbroken.\n  Failure to pass this bill again is not just some small \ndisappointment, something that can be easily brushed off or \ndisregarded; failure to pass this bill quite literally for many is a \ndeath sentence because every single day, every hour, every minute they \ndon't get the healthcare they need to save their lives is just another \nminute lost to the diseases that are devouring them. It is another \nminute they won't have to be with their loved ones, to hug their \nchildren; another minute they don't get to be with their loved ones to \nkiss them goodbye; another minute they cannot do the things they love \nto do. So we don't have time to wait another week, another month; we \nhave to do this now.\n  This is what is at stake with this bill. It is the lives of the men \nand women who went to combat for this country over the last many \ndecades and unfortunately have been so riddled with disease because of \nthat exposure that they need our help. They need the VA to cover their \nhealthcare. That is what this bill does. This is what they deserve.\n  I hope that this Chamber can come back together again where it was \nbefore last week to do the right thing, to stand by those who stood by \nus, to stand by those who went into the breach, to stand by those who \nare now suffering and dying because it is a debt that we owe them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, late tonight, the Senate will vote on \nmy amendment No. 5185 to the PACT Act, and as my colleague from New \nYork was just saying, it is time that we deal with the issues of toxic \nexposure. As a member of the VA Committee, this is something I have \nworked on for the last few years.\n  Tennessee has a large population of veterans, and we have talked a \ngood bit about this issue and how they receive their care.\n  One of the concerns that we had discussed in committee, in our \nhearings--we have discussed it with our VSOs, and we have discussed \nthis issue as we have talked with veterans who have come to us and to \nour meetings--is their frustration with having access to the queue but \nnot getting access to the care. I think we have to look at this and \nsay: Those are very different.\n  Now, I join our veterans in being frustrated with the fact that there \nis access to the queue to get on that wait list but not getting that \ncare. So the amendment I am offering is not political. It is not \ncontroversial. It is a simple but much needed improvement to the PACT \nAct that will allow toxic-exposed veterans to gain access to community \ncare to ensure they have a speedy process to care.\n\n  The amendment is critical to the success of this program, and we all \nwant the program to be successful, but what we know is that the VA is \nnot capable of implementing the PACT Act as it is written. They have \nneither the infrastructure nor the personnel to do that.\n  What we have learned is that the VA cannot deliver what is promised \nbecause it does not have the capacity to handle the increased cases. \nSecretary McDonough said as much in testimony submitted to the VA \nCommittee in March of this year.\n  Right now, the claims backlog at the VA sits at 168,000 cases. The \nPACT Act as written will increase that backlog by more than 1 million \ncases.\n  Right now in Tennessee, this is the practical effect of this in \nTennessee:\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nVeterans who come to me are telling me they are waiting about 100 days \nfor a primary care appointment at the VA. For many of our veterans, \nthat is just step 1--getting that primary care appointment so they get \non the list. So after they call, they are waiting 100 days to get that \nfirst appointment, and then they get a referral to someone else, a \nspecialist.\n  Now, for our veterans in Tennessee, once they get that referral, it \nis 39 days to get to mental health care, 44 days to get to a dental \nappointment, 33 days if they are trying to see a cardiologist, 28 days \nto see a gynecologist, and 30 days to get to someone who can help them \nwith pain. That is the amount of wait. To me, that is unacceptable, \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that many, if not most, \nof these veterans who have toxic exposure are deteriorating rapidly. \nThey do not have time to wait while the VA decides how they are going \nto implement this. They deserve access to care as quickly as they can \npossibly get it.\n  We are so close to getting these veterans the care they deserve, but \nif the PACT Act is going to work for veterans, we need to step up and \ngive them access to community care. My amendment will open up that \naccess. It will make that an option so they don't have to struggle \nthrough waiting in the queue. They can go to a physician in their \ncommunity for that primary care appointment so that they can get this \nprocess started. This will help them to avoid the long wait times and \nthe arbitrary hurdles, and it will let them seek that care in the \ncommunity if they can get it faster than making that trip to the VA.\n  As I said, this is not controversial. There is no political scandal \non it. It is a simple fix that will ensure that this promise that we \nare going to make in the PACT Act will be made to every single veteran \nwho has experienced toxic exposure so that we are certain that the PACT \nAct does not end up as a false promise or a false hope.\n  These veterans have given so much. They have served honorably. It is \nimperative that we provide them not access to the queue but access to \nthe care they have earned.\n  Thank you. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the amendment when it \ncomes up for a vote later this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we absolutely must take care of those who \nwere harmed in service to our country. I have supported several bills \nto take care of our veterans. In February of this year, I supported a \nbill that passed the Senate called the Health Care for Burn Pit \nVeterans Act, which extends the eligibility period for combat veterans \nwho served after 9/11 and were exposed to toxic substances so they are \nable to receive care at the VA. I have also supported the VA MISSION \nAct, the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act, the TEAM Caregivers \nAct, and the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, all of \nwhich expand care for veterans. When the war in Afghanistan came to a \nclose, I proposed using those funds saved by ending the war to give a \n$2,500 bonus to all members of the military who served in the Global \nWar on Terrorism.\n  We must take care of our veterans and keep our country strong. This \nbill puts our economy, though, at risk by creating presumptions of \nservice connection for the most common of ailments. For example, this \nlegislation creates a presumption of service connection for Vietnam \nveterans for hypertension, but according to the CDC, 50 percent of men \nand 44 percent of women in the United States have hypertension. More \nthan 60 percent of people over the age of 60 have hypertension. In \ntotal, the CDC estimates that 116 million Americans have hypertension. \nThe legislation also creates a presumption of service connection for \nGlobal War on Terror veterans for asthma. The CDC estimates that 1 in \n12 people has asthma, which is approximately 25 million Americans.\n  This bill would cost hundreds of billions of dollars at a time when \nthe national debt is climbing over $30 trillion and inflation is at a \n40-year high. But the Federal debt was created by Congress and not our \nvets, and those who serve in the armed services should not be the ones \nto pay the cost for government mismanagement. That is why I propose \nthat we pay for this bill by establishing a 10-year moratorium on \nforeign aid disbursed by USAID, except for Israel. USAID is riddled \nwith waste, and those dollars could be better put to use to help to \ntake care of our veterans' healthcare.\n  Just this year, USAID unveiled a $50 million Visit Tunisia program to \nencourage more tourism in Tunisia although Tunisia is already one of \nthe most visited countries in Africa.\n  In 2016, USAID started a program to help the Afghan Government help \nfarmers as it cut checks to NGOs to fund Afghan farmers.\n  The program paid for 72 farmers to receive drip irrigation, pipes, \nwheelbarrow, 2,000-liter water tank, and a 5-kilowatt generator for a \ncost of $87.9 million. Whether the systems are still in function or \nwere actually built is another question.\n  USAID spent over $37 million to assist the Filipino Government to get \nroughly 3 million Filipinos back to school. Maybe we ought to do the \nsame in America.\n  USAID devoted 20 million to teach the Laotians the Laotian language.\n  In another instance, USAID allocated up to $150,000 to send 10 \nKoreans to Washington, DC, for 2 weeks to learn about climate change \nactivism. That is a great use of our money.\n  Wouldn't Congress rather spend the money on our veterans? Wouldn't it \nmake more sense to spend taxpayer dollars on veterans who have risked \nit all for their country than on encouraging travel to Tunisia?\n  That is why I seek my colleagues' support for my amendment that would \nhelp pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in this bill. Our \nveterans should come first.\n  I ask your support for my amendment on this pay-for amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 5184\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House message to \naccompany S. 3373 with amendment No. 5184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] moves to concur in the \n     House amendment to S. 3373 with an amendment numbered 5184.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask that the reading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To offset the increased spending authorized by this Act by \n  temporarily prohibiting the expenditure of any Federal funds by the \nUnited States Agency for International Development other than spending \n                              for Israel.)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. OFFSET THROUGH TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN FOREIGN \n                   ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       During the 10-year period beginning on October 1, 2022, no \n     Federal funds may be expended by the United States Agency for \n     International Development other than funds that have been \n     appropriated for Israel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                                S. 3373\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the PACT Act, on which \nwe will be voting for several amendments and then we will have a final \npassage vote later this evening.\n  This could have been resolved months ago, as I suggested it would be, \nbut finally we have gotten to the point where we can resolve this.\n  And I have to say we are witnessing a very old Washington trick \nplaying out on what might be an unprecedented scale.\n  And what is that trick?\n  That trick is you take a very sympathetic group of Americans--it \ncould be children with rare diseases; it could be victims of crime; it \ncould be veterans who are suffering an illness after having been \nexposed to toxic chemicals while serving our country--you take this \nsympathetic group, craft legislation to address their problems, and \nthen sneak in something that is completely unrelated that could never \npass on its own and dare anyone to stand up and say a word about that \nbecause we all know, if you raise a concern about the unrelated \nprovision, people in this Chamber and outside will stand up and make up \nall kinds of fabrications and falsehoods.\n  They will enlist some pseudo celebrities, they will get their \naccomplices\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nin the media to propagate the dishonest charge that: Oh, those mean \nRepublicans don't care about those sympathetic figures. That is what \nhas been going on here for some time now.\n  It is in the PACT Act. We have an exceptionally sympathetic, \noverwhelmingly popular group of Americans--and rightly so. They are \nveterans who put on the uniform, served overseas, took huge risks, and \nalong the way were exposed to toxic chemicals that have resulted or \ncould have resulted in their illness.\n  There is overwhelming consensus to provide the resources to at least \ncover their healthcare costs and provide them with disability benefits \nbecause of their service to our country.\n  In fact, the cause is so popular that the $280 billion of new \nspending contemplated by this bill is completely unoffset. It is \nmandatory spending. It is like OCO, and there is nobody I know of--\ncertainly not myself--who is asking that it be offset. It is like, this \nis what we need to do and people acknowledge this and we agree on it.\n  But that is not where the PACT Act ends. That is not all there is to \nthe PACT Act. It also includes the old Washington trick. And the form \nthe trick takes in this bill is a complicated change to budget rules \nthat allows current spending--by which I mean spending that is going to \nhappen under existing law unrelated to the PACT Act, that spending that \nis routine already--to be basically shifted off the books, so to speak, \nin such a way that is designed to make it easier for future Congresses \nto spend a whole lot more money on completely unrelated programs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this clever little \ndevice will result--could result in up to maybe even a little more than \n$400 billion of additional spending over the next 10 years; again, \ntotally outside of the veteran space, totally outside.\n  Now, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs is my friend \nJon Tester, a guy I know and like. He pretty much essentially \nacknowledged that yes, the legislation could be exploited this way. But \nhe said: But you should have faith. You should have confidence and \ntrust in your colleagues, future Congresses, that we wouldn't do a \nthing like that.\n  Seriously? I am supposed to trust this and future Congresses not to \ngo on a spending spree--seriously? That is unbelievable. And, by the \nway, if I should have that trust, then why did they design this feature \nprecisely so they could go on a spending spree?\n  This isn't the first time this has happened. A good example is the \nCHIPS program. That is an acronym for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. It was created in 1997. It is a very popular program. It is \nmandatory spending, completely unoffset. It is a very good cause. That \nis why.\n  In 2009, Congress started providing more funding than was necessary \nto fund the program--much more than would actually be spent on the kids \nthat qualified for it. Congress did this very knowingly and started \ndoing it annually. Why, you might ask, would Congress provide more \nfunding than the program requires? Because the amount by which this \nfunding exceeds what gets spent can be spent on other programs.\n  It is a trick. It is a budget trick that allows for more spending in \nunrelated areas.\n  The Crime Victims Fund has a very similar dynamic. Criminal penalties \ngo into a fund that is supposed to go to victims of crime, but they set \nup the rules so that, in any given year, if we spend less than the \namount of money that went into this fund, they can pretend those are \nbudget savings and then spend the money somewhere else.\n  So my point is that we have seen this before. It is being played out \nagain, but I don't think we have ever seen it on this scale--$400 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  We have budgets and we have budget rules for reasons. They are meant \nto try to provide some guardrails on spending. Now, Congress can always \ndisregard them. Any Congress can always disregard budget rules for a \ngood reason or a bad reason. If there are 60 votes, the budget rules \ncan be waived.\n  By the way, there are five budget points of order against this bill. \nI am not aware that anyone has raised a single one. We are not going to \nhave a vote on any one, and that is because people say the new spending \nfor these veterans is so important that we are going to waive the \nbudget rules that this bill breaks, and I think that is the right thing \nto do. But to think that the appropriations process is going to be a \nsufficient check on the abuse of this gimmick that is in this bill is \nvery unrealistic.\n  You know, the Senate can always vote against a future spending bill \nthat would take advantage of this. All right, so this is one of the \narguments we have heard: Well, yes, you can always vote against this if \nCongress were to exploit this gimmick and start spending these $400 \nbillion.\n  But here is the problem. In a given year, that would be about $40 \nbillion, right? Four hundred over 10 years means $400 billion of this \nextraneous spending annually. Except, as the Presiding Officer knows \nvery well, we typically fund the government with one giant bill--an \nomnibus spending bill that is over 1,000 pages long, usually. Nowadays, \nit is about $1.7 trillion. And $40 billion is a lot of money, but it is \n3 percent of $1.7 trillion.\n  So if you object to exploiting this budget gimmick and exploiting \nthis loophole and spending $40 billion that shouldn't be spent on who \nknows what, you can vote against the whole bill and that is your only \noption--vote to shut down the government and not spend any money at \nall. That is no disciplinary mechanism. That is no mechanism for proper \noversight.\n  Now, you may hear that my amendment caps spending for veterans, and I \nwant to be very clear about this. The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee said my amendment would place a limit on the amount of \nfunding Congress could provide to cover care and benefits to veterans \nmade available by this legislation and could create a scenario where \nthe VA runs out of funding.\n  That is completely, 100-percent factually false. It is very hard to \nbelieve that the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is not \naware of that.\n  But here is the truth. The fund that is created in the PACT Act--the \nfund that the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is referring \nto, the fund where we cap the money that goes into this fund--that fund \ndoes not have the meaning that any normal person thinks a fund has. \nThis is not a pool of money. This is not an account at a bank from \nwhich doctors are paid. This is nothing more than an accounting device. \nThis is just a mechanism that the Federal Government uses to classify \nspending as mandatory instead of discretionary. That is all it is.\n  And there are no limits whatsoever. This is an important point. My \namendment has no limits whatsoever on the amount that Congress can \nappropriate in any given year or in the cumulative total of years for \nveterans' healthcare or other benefits. My amendment doesn't affect \nthat in any way whatsoever. Congress can appropriate a trillion dollars \nin a given year.\n  What my amendment would do is it would limit the amount of that \nappropriation that could be considered mandatory spending as opposed to \ndiscretionary spending. That is it. My amendment is 100 percent about \nhow the government designates the spending. It has nothing to do with \nhow much is actually spent.\n  Now, what matters to a veteran who is ill because of a toxic \nexposure? I think what matters to him is that the money is there to \ncover what he needs. That is what he should be concerned about, and \nthat will be there.\n  What I am trying to limit is the extent to which they can use a \nbudgetary gimmick to reclassify spending so that they can go on an \nunrelated spending binge.\n  So what would happen if the cost for actually caring for veterans in \na given year is bigger than the cap we set? Appropriators simply \nappropriate the amount that is needed. My cap has no bearing on how \nmuch appropriators can spend. It only limits how much gets treated as \nmandatory spending.\n  If my amendment is adopted, spending on veterans' benefits would not \nbe reduced by one penny. Spending on veterans' families would not be \nreduced by one penny. The $280 billion in new spending as a result of \nthe PACT Act would not be reduced by a penny. It would not be offset.\n  We have no attempt to make any change to any of that. If anyone is \nsuggesting that my amendment would, in\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nany way, reduce care for veterans or require rationing of care, they \nare either completely misinformed or they are being dishonest.\n  So why does this matter? Why did the authors of the bill want to \ncreate this device that shifts this spending that is going to happen \nanyway from discretionary spending to mandatory spending? Because we \nhave a cap on total discretionary spending, and for any spending that \ngets pulled out of the discretionary spending category and goes to a \ndifferent category, that creates a hole under the cap. Congress will \nfill that hole with spending on who knows what. That is the way this is \ngoing to play out. That is what is going to happen.\n  Now, some people have suggested that my amendment, if adopted, would \nkill the bill. Now, think about that. An amendment that does not cut \nspending on veterans' care or veterans' benefits by one dime but does \nmake it harder for Congress to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending \nspree--that is going to kill the bill? Really?\n  Well, if that would kill the bill, then it speaks volumes about what \nis really important to the people who would vote no as a result of \nmaking it clear that unrelated spending is more important than the \nspending on the veterans--if my amendment would kill the bill.\n  So I don't think passage of my amendment would kill the bill. It \nwould frustrate the efforts of those who want to have the skids greased \nfor a massive spending binge. It would definitely do that. But it \nwouldn't cut one dime of spending for veterans' care, and I think in \nthe end the bill would pass.\n  I have this very simple solution. It allows us to fully fund our \nvets. It eliminates this budgetary gimmick that greases the skids for \nunrelated spending. And I would just urge my colleagues that hiding \nunrelated spending behind the sacrifice our veterans have made is no \nway to go. I would urge support for my amendment.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur With Amendment No. 5186\n\n  Mr. President, I move to concur in the House message to accompany S. \n3373 with amendment No. 5186.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in just a few minutes--in fact, maybe I \nshould say finally in just a few minutes--the Senate will vote once \nagain on the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise \nto Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, known as the PACT Act.\n  Thousands of veterans who answered their call to serve after the \nterrorist attacks of 9/11 suffered the consequences to their health \nwith exposure to open burn pits. Many of these veterans are \nsimultaneously experiencing a battle with the VA--a battle with their \nhealth conditions and now a battle with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs--to gain access to healthcare and the benefits that they \ndesperately need and, in reality, earned and deserve.\n  For more than 2 years, I worked with my colleagues on the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, its chairman Senator Tester, our \ncolleagues in the House and Senate, multiple VSOs, veterans across the \ncountry, and veterans in Kansas and their families on how we can \nprovide toxic-exposed veterans the healthcare benefits that they \ndeserve.\n  Chairman Tester and I made a commitment to each other to get to this \npoint today, and we have had a couple of procedural hurdles. But, \ndespite that, I am pleased that we have still brought this bill to the \nfloor in a bipartisan manner. Our veterans have waited long enough, and \nit is time to pass the Heath Robinson PACT Act.\n  Not only will this legislation provide long overdue healthcare and \nbenefits to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to burn \npits, but this legislation will deliver care for all generations of \nveterans, including Vietnam veterans and those who served in Southeast \nAsia suffering from the exposure to Agent Orange.\n  No legislation is perfect. Is this bill the way I would draft it if I \nwere the only person writing the bill? It is not. It is a legislative \nprocess that involves a give and take, and we will still have more work \nto do once the legislation is signed into law.\n  I remain committed to working with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, with our veterans service organizations, with individual \nveterans and their families, and with my colleagues\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\nhere in the Senate, both Republican and Democratic, to make certain \nthat this legislation is effective for veterans and the unintended \nconsequences from this legislation are addressed.\n  Once we pass legislation, the work continues because it then has to \nbe implemented by the Department of Veterans Affairs. I know from \nexperience that that is a challenge, and this bill in particular--with \nthe magnitude, the number of veterans affected, the amount of resources \nnecessary, the demand for care that will arise under this legislation, \nand the demand for benefits that arises under this legislation--will \nmake its implementation a significant challenge. But we are ready and \nable to make certain that the intended results--while there has been a \nlot of demand that we pass legislation, really what we are after are \nintended results, and those intended results are that our veterans \nreceive the care and benefits that they deserve.\n  There is no doubt that the cost of caring for our veterans is high, \nand the truth is that freedom is not free. There is always a cost to \nwar, and we need to remind ourselves that that cost is not fully paid \nwhen the war ends.\n  We are now on the verge of honoring that commitment to America's \nveterans and their families. I support this legislation. I support \nmoving forward with a vote in favor of cloture. As to something that we \nthought might have happened earlier, I am pleased that there will be \namendment votes before we get to that final passage. I expect and urge \nmy colleagues, regardless of the outcome of the amendment votes, to \ncontinue to move this bill forward by taking this opportunity to pass \nthe bill.\n  By taking advantage of the circumstance we have now worked our way to \nget to, and now that we are at this point, I hope that it passes, the \nSergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, and that, \nwith the Presidential signature, it becomes law.\n  To my colleagues who have worked on this, I express my gratitude to \nmy colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, on the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. I appreciate the opportunity that I have to be in leadership \non that committee and to work every day on behalf of those who have \nserved our Nation.\n  Let's pass this legislation. Let's deliver the most comprehensive \ntoxic exposure package to veterans in our country's history.\n  With that plea and suggestion, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I stand in front of this body, yet again, \nto urge the passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring \nOur PACT Act.\n  Before I get into my remarks, Senator Moran is on the floor, and I \nlistened to a good portion of what he had to say.\n  I just want to say thank you, Senator Moran. As a team member on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, for the last year and a half, we have been \nworking in good faith to get a bill that addresses the challenges of \ntoxic exposure that our veterans, quite honestly, have endured since \nWorld War I. With the burn pits and Agent Orange and radiation exposure \nthat this bill addresses, I would just say that we would not be here \ntoday if we had not both committed to work together to get to a result \nthat, hopefully--I was a little more sure last week than I am today, \nbut, hopefully, we will get to a point where this bill passes.\n  We have talked about this bill a lot, and we have talked about what \nit does. Basically, what it does is to make sure that the veterans who \nhave been exposed to toxins--in this case, burn pits but also, as I \nsaid before, Agent Orange and radiation--are made whole again.\n  So we get these folks; we train them to be warriors; and we send \nthese men and women off to war. We tell them to go out and protect our \nfreedoms and protect this country. They do it, and, oftentimes, things \nhappen that change their lives. Sometimes those are injuries we can \nsee, and sometimes we can't see them. In this particular case, with \ntoxic burn pits, they come home, and they have developed disorders \nbecause they have breathed these toxins in.\n  If anybody has ever been around a burning barrel that has plastics in \nit, you know exactly what I am talking about. You breathe these toxins \nin, and it causes cancer, and it causes lung issues.\n  The problem is that these folks couldn't get away. These burn pits \nwere right outside the camps; they were right next to the chow line; \nthey were right next to the beds they slept in, and they had to breathe \nthis garbage, sometimes day and night. It has resulted in some pretty \nserious injuries that have resulted oftentimes in death.\n  Now, the reason I say that is that, over the last year and a half, \nthe Senate's Veterans' Affairs Committee has had several hearings, and \nwe have had witnesses come forth who have been impacted by burn pits \nand toxic exposure. I can tell you that some of those folks aren't with \nus today. The toxins got them. So not only was the veteran's life \nended, which is unfortunate in and of itself, but also the family who \nwas dependent on that veteran had their lives turned upside down.\n  So it is time that we set that record straight and make sure that \nthose folks who have been impacted by war are taken care of. I hope \nthat there is nobody in this body who thinks that that is unreasonable \nbecause the truth is, I think most of the folks in this body have been \nto the Middle East and have seen what a different world that is and how \nit makes me damned glad to be a Montanan and to be an American.\n  But we have got the ability today to step up and do the right thing. \nThere have been a lot of claims made over the last week or two. I would \ngo into those claims and refute those claims, but, quite frankly, I \ndon't see the sense in it. If the folks here haven't read this bill and \nif they haven't read the letter that I sent out to every Senator in \nthis body earlier today, I would ask that you would. If you have any \nquestions, come run me down, and I will answer any of them.\n  The fact is, we have done this whole process in a very transparent \nmanner--with no surprises, no last-minute stuff put into this bill, no \nslush funds. This is a bill that will work for this country; that will \nwork for the taxpayers in this country; and that will work, most \nimportantly, for the veterans and their families.\n  We have an opportunity, as I said last week, to do the right thing \ntoday. We have an opportunity to have the American people be proud of \nthe Senate and the work they do. I would hope we would get a resounding \nvote on this bill, and I would hope that we wouldn't amend it and for \nit to have to go back to the House because that, once again, would \ndelay benefits and do real damage to this bill.\n  So I would ask my fellow Senators, when they come to the floor and \nvote, to think about the veterans who are standing outside the Capitol \nout here, to think about the veterans in your home State, and to think \nabout the veterans whom you met while they were on Active Duty on your \ncodels. Remember them, and do the right thing: vote to pass the \nSergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act.\n  I yield back all remaining time.\n\n\n                        Vote on Motion to Concur\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on the Paul motion to \nconcur with an amendment.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 7, the \nnays are 90.\n  Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this \nmotion to concur with amendment, the motion is rejected.\n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the Toomey motion to concur with amendment No. 5186.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, a lot has been said about my amendment \nthat is completely false, mostly outside of this Chamber, so let me say \nvery simply what it does. My amendment does only one thing, it would \nmaintain the current policy of classifying currently authorized VA \nhealthcare spending as discretionary spending, rather than change that \nclassification going forward to mandatory spending as the PACT Act \nwould allow.\n  My amendment does not cap any spending. It does not reduce veteran \nspending. It does not change the classification of PACT Act spending.\n  But by preventing this change in classification, we would prevent a \nbudget gimmick that is designed to grease the skids for up to $400 \nbillion in totally unrelated spending.\n  So let's pass the PACT Act, but let's pass it without enabling an \nunrelated $400 billion spending spree. Support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the Toomey amendment does place an \narbitrary limit on the amount of funding that Congress can spend each \nyear in support of veterans, those are called caps. Don't take my word \nfor it. That comes from the Appropriations Committee and the Budgets \nCommittee. And when you place caps, that results in rationing of care.\n  Look, just like every other mandatory account that the VA has, you \ncome forth as part of the President's budget; the VA has to justify it; \nCongress, Congress, Congress details the estimates and needs for the \nfunds, for the purpose, whether it is toxic exposure or anything else; \nit will be reviewed as part of the standard appropriation process.\n  I would recommend, if you don't trust your appropriators, to put \nsomebody else on the committee, because that is what this all comes \ndown to, is the appropriators. I would ask you to vote no on this \namendment.\n\n\n                        Vote on Motion to Concur\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto concur with amendment No. 5186.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the reading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the provision of care under the Veterans Community \n                Care Program for toxic-exposed veterans)\n\n       On page 15, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 105.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, this is the amendment that will allow \nour veterans to immediately move into community care. Our veterans need \nto be able to have access to the care, not just access to the queue.\n  The VA will have a problem getting this implemented because the \ncurrent wait time to see a primary care doctor is 100 days. So let's \nnot make them wait. Let's give them access to community care so that \nthey have the care they have earned and they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. The Blackburn amendment would provide automatic \neligibility to community care for any toxic-exposed veteran for any \ncondition. However, I want to make it clear that if a veteran should \never need care the VA cannot provide, they are automatically eligible \nin that case.\n  We can talk about the cost. We can talk about the accountability. We \ncould talk about the timelines of going into the private sector. \nUnfortunately,\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nwe don't have those times, and we don't have those metrics, but what we \ndo know is this.

Mr. President, we are poised once again with the \nopportunity to pass a piece of legislation of historic significance, \nsomething that demonstrates the U.S. Senate can come together and take \ncare of Americans, particularly those who served our Nation.\n  While it is historic, it is more important to many individuals--\nhistoric for the country, historic for veterans, but important, \nlifesaving, supportive of those who have encountered toxic exposure \nfrom Vietnam and Southeast Asia through Agent Orange and through burn \npits in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Heath Robinson family and all the \nadvocates who got us to this point today. I ask my colleagues to pass \nthis legislation, and I ask the President to sign it as quickly as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, 15 years ago, when I was appointed to the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I had a Vietnam veteran come up to \nme and say: ``You are not going to treat this generation of veterans \nlike you have treated us.'' This bill rights that and makes that \nveteran's request come true. Why? Because we are dealing with toxic \nexposure. In fact, we are even dealing with it with Agent Orange and \nthe burn pits.\n  This fully pays the cost of war, and I would encourage everybody in \nthis body to vote for this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this long-awaited moment for our Nation's \nveterans is occurring now. The Senate is finally--finally--going to \npass the most significant expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in \ngenerations. This is a very good day, a long-awaited day, a day that \nshould have happened long ago.\n  For decades, many of our Nation's veterans have endured a shameful \nreality. They went abroad to serve our country bravely, got sick from \ntoxic exposure in the line of duty, but came home and learned they \ndidn't qualify for the benefits they needed to treat their illnesses. \nIt is shameful. It is infuriating.\n  Today, we tell our veterans suffering from cancers, lung diseases, \nand other ailments from burn pits: The wait is over for the benefits \nyou deserve. No more pointless delays on getting the healthcare you \nneed. No more jumping through hoops and even hiring lawyers just to get \nan answer from the VA.\n  Today, if you are a veteran--from Vietnam to Iraq, to Afghanistan, to \neverywhere in between--and you get sick from burn pit exposure or Agent \nOrange, you will finally be able to get your earned benefits \nguaranteed.\n  I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for \nworking together to push the PACT Act over the line, especially \nSenators Tester and Moran, who were the original leaders of the bill, \nmy colleague Senator Gillibrand from New York, and I thank in advance \nall my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who will vote for this \nmuch needed legislation.\n  Importantly, I want to thank the many veterans, veterans service \norganizations, and advocates, like Jon Stewart and John Feal, who led a \nrighteous, mighty movement to get this bill done. It wouldn't have \nhappened without you.\n  Especially, I want to thank the veterans who camped at the foot of \nCapitol Hill for the past few days, enduring scorching heat and \ndrenching rain just to get to this point. They said they would never go \nhome until they got this bill done. They are here.\n  Well, I have good news. In a few minutes, after this bill passes, you \ncan go home knowing the good and great thing you have done and \naccomplished for the United States of America.\n  Because of them, veterans everywhere will finally get the dignity and \ncare they deserve.\n  The PACT Act is now going to the President's desk.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n\n\n                        Vote on Motion to Concur\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to S. 3373.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant executive clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A bill to modify the authority of the Secretary of Defense \nto transfer excess aircraft to other departments of the Federal \nGovernment and to authorize the Secretary to transfer excess aircraft \nto the Governor of a State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. PADILLA, Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan \nEmergency Aircraft Act of 2022.\n  Currently, DOD has a program to transfer excess aircraft to Federal \nAgencies for wildfire suppression purposes. However, under current law, \nDOD is limited to providing only seven aircraft total to each Agency.\n  After years of increasingly catastrophic wildfires, it has become \nclear that the Federal Government must do more to support suppression \nefforts to get fires under control quickly, as well as support search \nand rescue to keep communities safe. If there are excess aircraft \navailable, they should be put to use suppressing fires and protecting \ncommunities.\n  Furthermore, as fire activity has exploded in the past few years, \nStates have stepped up and greatly increased their own suppression \nefforts. They should also be allowed to utilize these excess aircraft \nto increase suppression capabilities and put fires out faster. However, \nunder current law, States do not have access to these excess aircraft.\n  This bill would remove the arbitrary cap on how many excess aircraft \nDOD can transfer to Federal Agencies for wildfire suppression efforts; \nallow States to receive excess aircraft; expand the purposes for which \nthese aircraft could be used from just ``wildfire suppression \npurposes'' to include purposes of ``wildfire suppression, search and \nrescue, or emergency operations pertaining to wildfires''; and mandate \nan annual report from DOD to the Committees on Armed Services of the \nSenate and the House of Representatives on aircraft transferred during \nthe previous fiscal year.\n  This bill represents a commonsense step forward to expand fire \nsuppression and search and rescue operations across the Federal \nGovernment and State governments.\n  I want to thank Senator Cramer for joining me in this bipartisan \neffort, and I urge my colleagues to join us in working to pass this \nbill as quickly as possible in light of the extreme wildfire danger \nfacing States across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-28"}

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 3034) to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide \nan additional place for holding court for the Western District of \nWashington, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 3034.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H7931]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3034 which would amend title \n28 of the U.S. Code to provide an additional place for holding court in \nthe Western District of Washington.\n  This one-sentence bill would allow the residents of that district \nwhich is comprised of half of Washington State from the Cascade \nMountains to the Pacific Ocean to attend Federal Court in Mount Vernon, \nWashington, halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border.\n  Currently, residents of the surrounding counties, including the third \nmost populous county in the State, have to travel significant distances \nto access the Federal justice system leading to increased travel time \nand administrative costs. Adding Mount Vernon as an additional court \nlocation would alleviate those burdens. It would also be a cost-free \nchange because there is an existing facility available for the court to \nuse, and no court personnel would be permanently stationed there. \nMaking use of this existing facility would ensure that litigants, \nattorneys, witnesses, and other court users would have greater access \nto the justice that our Federal courts provide.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee is the holder, protector, and \nnurturer of the Constitution. There is probably nothing as important \namong other elements but for the right to a trial by jury or right to \nbe heard as a litigant in a court. This important legislation is \nsuggesting that those who may have difficulty or are even deprived \nbecause of distance or other issues dealing with the far reaches of \nwhere this court is away from them can now have unfettered access to \ncourt in their region, in their area.\n  This move will benefit the many individuals who live, work, and do \nbusiness in northwest Washington which is very far from the present \nsite of the Federal Court. This legislation is broadly supported by the \njudges, attorneys, prosecutors, public defenders, and law enforcement \nin the Western District of Washington.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Suzan DelBene and Rick Larsen for \ncalling attention to this issue and for introducing this legislation to \nimprove the lives of the residents of Washington State. Chairman Nadler \nand all of the members of the Judiciary Committee were very pleased to \nwork with this legislation, and Congresswoman DelBene and Congressman \nLarsen to be able to make this fix to provide an additional pathway of \njustice and the protection of the constitutional rights of individuals \nto have their access to courts and to trials by jury.\n  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to close, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, it appears that this bill has wide, \nbipartisan support among Members of Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is good music and good sounds to hear my colleague \nindicating that this legislation has widespread support, and he is \nabsolutely right.\n  The only point that I would want to emphasize is that whenever this \nbody and this Judiciary Committee can expand the rights to the \nprotection of Americans and their rights to access justice, we should \nstand tall.\n  Today, this legislation, with a small fix of providing an additional \nsite for the people of western Washington to access their \nconstitutional, judicial, and legal rights, I think this is a \ncelebration. So because of the broad support for this, we are \ndelighted.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 3034, and make known that it is a \nstraightforward bill that will improve the administration of justice in \nWashington State and will reinforce our duty and responsibility to the \nAmerican people for justice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3034, which would amend title \n28 of the U.S. Code to provide an additional place for holding court in \nthe Western District of Washington.\n  This one-sentence bill would allow residents of that district, which \ncomprises half of Washington state--from the Cascade Mountains to the \nPacific Ocean--to attend federal court in Mount Vernon, Washington, \nhalfway between Seattle and the Canadian border.\n  Currently, residents of the surrounding counties, including the third \nmost-populous county in the state, have to travel significant distances \nto access the federal justice system, leading to increased travel time \nand administrative costs. Adding Mount Vernon as an additional court \nlocation would alleviate those burdens. It would also be a cost-free \nchange because there is an existing facility available for the court to \nuse, and no court personnel would be permanently stationed there.\n  Making use of this existing facility would ensure that litigants, \nattorneys, witnesses, and other court users would have greater access \nto the justice that our federal courts provide.\n  This move will benefit the many individuals who live, work, and do \nbusiness in Northwest Washington, and this legislation is broadly \nsupported by the judges, attorneys, prosecutors, public defenders, and \nlaw enforcement in the Western District of Washington.\n  I thank Representatives Suzan DelBene and Rick Larsen for calling \nattention to this issue and for introducing this legislation to improve \nthe lives of the residents of Washington state.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3034 is a straightforward bill that will improve \nthe administration of justice in Washington State. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3034.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-10-01"}

Res. 467\n\n       Whereas the Department of Defense began developing the \n     Arecibo Observatory located in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, \n     Puerto Rico, during the 1950s, and its characteristic \n     instrument, a large radio telescope of 305 meters in diameter \n     was completed in 1963;\n       Whereas the facility was later owned by the National \n     Science Foundation, and supported by the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration and various university partners;\n       Whereas the Arecibo Observatory's 305-meter fixed spherical \n     radio telescope, was the world's largest single-dish radio \n     telescope until the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical \n     Radio Telescope located in Gizhou, China, began observing in \n     2016;\n       Whereas the 305-meter radio telescope made unparalleled \n     contributions to the fields of radio astronomy, planetary, \n     and atmospheric sciences, and played a role in inspiring \n     thousands of students in Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the \n     world to pursue careers in STEM fields through the Arecibo \n     Observatory Education and Public Outreach Programs;\n       Whereas the radio telescope significantly advanced the \n     field of radio astronomy, including the first indirect \n     detection of gravitational waves, the first detection of \n     extrasolar planets, innumerable contributions to the field of \n     time domain astronomy and the study of the interstellar \n     medium, and played a key role in the search for \n     extraterrestrial intelligence;\n       Whereas the Arecibo Observatory had the best planetary \n     radar system in the world, used by the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration for near-Earth object detection and \n     was a part of the agency's planetary defense program;\n       Whereas the planetary radar at the Arecibo Observatory has \n     contributed fundamentally and significantly to the knowledge \n     of the solar system;\n       Whereas the Arecibo Observatory's Incoherent Scatter Radar \n     and supporting facilities have provided fundamental \n     understanding of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere, and the \n     interface between the atmosphere and space that protects the \n     planet from solar wind, meteors, and other potential threats; \n     and\n       Whereas December 1, 2021, marks the 1-year anniversary of \n     the uncontrolled collapse sustained by the radio telescope \n     after a series of cable failures in tower 4: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo Observatory's \n     radio telescope due to its collapse and its implications for \n     the loss of a unique world-class multidisciplinary science \n     facility which conducted research in the areas of space and \n     atmospheric sciences, radar astronomy and planetary sciences, \n     astronomy, and astrophysics;\n       (2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled collapse of the 305-\n     meter radio telescope represents a remarkable loss of \n     astronomical observation capabilities, scientific research \n     and development, planetary defense capabilities, and applied \n     science advantage for the United States;\n       (3) recognizes the rich scientific, educational, and \n     economic benefits that the Arecibo Telescope has made to the \n     people of Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world;\n       (4) recognizes the work and contributions made by the \n     thousands of dedicated staff who have supported the Arecibo \n     Observatory for close to 6 decades;\n       (5) commends the National Science Foundation for convening \n     a virtual workshop in June 2021, to explore ideas for future \n     scientific and educational activities at the Arecibo \n     Observatory; and\n       (6) encourages the National Science Foundation, in \n     consultation with the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, and other agencies to study means of \n     replacing the scientific capabilities that were lost at the \n     Arecibo Observatory, utilizing new state-of-the-art \n     technologies at the site.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-02-14"}

Mr. President, last night was a reminder of a difficult \nbut important reality of our great democracy: The march to freedom, \nthrough thick and thin, is never over--and we have to keep marching.\n  While last night's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate \nDemocrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark \nmoney, and partisan gerrymandering. Democrats are proud of the fight we \nheld last night. The strength, eloquence, enthusiasm, and overwhelming \nparticipation of my Democratic colleagues during debate was \nexhilarating and shows the passion we feel about this issue.\n  Facing an uphill battle from the start, we lost the vote. But to have \nnot voted would have been a far greater loss, a loss for our Democratic \nParty, which for generations has stood for voting rights; a loss for \nthe civil rights advocates who have sacrificed so much on this issue; \nand a loss for the American people and what this country stands for. On \nan issue this important, not doing everything we could would have been \nunacceptable.\n  Now, the bromides of the beltway class hold we should not have held a \nvote on voting rights if the outcome was not certain. They are wrong. \nImagine telling Dr. King not to march from Selma to Montgomery because \nhe could not be sure what obstacles awaited him and his fellow freedom \nfighters. Imagine telling John Lewis he should never have crossed the \nPettus Bridge because it was unclear what perils awaited him on the \nother side.\n  Every Member of this body who has ever invoked these great titans of \nfreedom has an obligation--an obligation--to uphold their legacies not \njust with words but with actions. Senators were elected to vote. The \nexamples of Dr. King, of John Lewis inspire us, give us strength, and \nshow us that sometimes the only right option is to move forward.\n  And we need to remember what this is about. With the advent of Donald \nTrump and his many Big Lies, with the January 6 insurrection, with the \nvicious acts of voter suppression throughout the States, and with the \ngreedy dark money interests that fuel the Republican Party these days, \nthis is a fight for the soul of America--nothing less. So Democrats \nwill not shy away from an uphill fight; we will continue to face them.\n  And I believe that the lessons of history are clear: When \nRepresentatives have to take a stand, when they have to show to the \nAmerican people where they are on the issues, the right side of history \nultimately prevails. We know history is on the side of voting rights, \nand we know that forcing leaders to take stands will ultimately move \nthe ball forward.\n  Now, finally, I want to thank all my colleagues who came to the floor \nyesterday to speak valiantly in defense of voting rights and for \nworking assiduously for months on this vital issue: Senators Klobuchar \nand Merkley, Booker, Schatz, Senator Kaine--you, Mr. President--\nSenators King, Tester, Warnock, Ossoff, Durbin, Padilla, Leahy--and so \nmany, so many more. Their leadership, their expertise, and their \ndedication to protecting our democracy is inspiring. It gives our \ncaucus strength, and it made such a difference. Last night was unusual \nand exhilarating because we fought the good fight.\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\n  As former Majority Leader Alben Barkley of Kentucky said 80 years ago \nthis November, facing a filibuster, which successfully blocked anti-\npoll tax legislation--the majority leader, Alben Barkley, from \nKentucky, said:\n\n       I am glad I have made this fight. I have made it in behalf \n     of what I believe to be the broad and true foundations of a \n     true democracy.\n\n  Senate Democrats fighting for voting rights is not over. We will keep \nfighting until voting rights are protected for every single American. \nAnd one day--hopefully, sooner rather than later--we will succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-01-23"}

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I and my colleagues are going to spend \nthe next hour raising to the attention of every American the large and \nlooming crisis that hangs over the heads of our fellow Americans, but \nespecially the next generation of Americans on account of our ever-\ngrowing, massive, almost incalculable national debt at $31 trillion and \ncounting; with a projection of $16 trillion over the next decade. By \nthe way, half of that will be interest payments on the debt, without a \nsingle dollar or dime going to something productive, to help a soldier \nor a sailor or a senior with a safety net program. It will be servicing \nthe debt of this country.\n  I believe this is the long-term greatest threat to America. As \nAdmiral Mullen stated when asked by the defense community what the \ngreatest national security threat was, he replied: The national debt is \nthe greatest national security threat.\n  Why?\n  Because a debt crisis in any form will undermine our ability to \nprovide for the common defense and have a military and weapons systems \nthat will be sufficient for the ever-evolving and growing threats, \nespecially the great power threats like China.\n  It will undermine economic security and prosperity, and this land of \nopportunity, this American promise for our children and grandchildren. \nI don't believe there is a more important issue.\n  In his Farewell Address, George Washington, our first President and \none of the Founding Fathers, the Father of America, mentioned foreign \ninfluence, factions that divide us and weaken the bonds of American \nunity, and American oneness, but then he mentioned, `` . . . avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned . . . `'\n  Translation: You may have to borrow money when you are in a world \nwar, but just like the last time we were over 100 percent debt-to-GDP, \nour Nation was willing to make the cuts to expenses and bring down the \ndebt when we were in peacetime.\n  We are now at 128 percent over the size of debt relative to our \neconomy in World War II. We are carrying the largest debt in the \nhistory of the United States, and we are not at war. The horizon and \nthe trajectory, not only over 10 years, but if you look at 30 years, it \nis over $120 trillion in additional debt. It is mind-boggling. It is \nunconscionable. And I think it is immoral to hand a country--in such \nshambles fiscally and so bankrupt--to the next generation, and just \nliterally wipe out their future and the blessings of liberty and \nopportunity that every generation of Americans have inherited to date.\n  George Washington says we should avoid these things. We should bend \nthe expense curve. We should bring down debt, and not ungenerously \nthrow that debt upon posterity, the burden, he says, `` . . . which we \nourselves ought to bear.''\n  I see that every day in Congress. Instead of us bearing the burden by \npaying for the government that we believe the American people want--I \nam not so sure they want this government, this ever-expanding \ngovernment--but when we are giving that government to them, we ought to \npay for it and not defer the taxes on the next generation.\n  That is not the American way. That has not been the American \ntradition of our lawmakers. We are in a real bad spot and it is going \nto take courage. It is going to take courage from everybody, regardless \nof party, to find a way not only to start paying for things through \nexpense cuts, and in the case\n\n[[Page H8300]]\n\nof my Democrat colleagues, raising revenue.\n  We are way beyond just being able to offset and even grow the economy \nand get out of this debt hole. We are going to have to take \nextraordinary action. It is going to require extraordinary courage. \nQuite frankly, I haven't seen that on either side.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  But I think we have a tremendous opportunity in the future as \nRepublicans look to take over in the House as the majority party and \nthen get to demonstrate to the American people leadership on this \nissue.\n  We have seen $5 trillion in new spending over the last 2 years under \nthis administration--$5 trillion. And I hope and pray that my party \nwill live up to the confidence and trust that the American people will \nput into us to steward this great Nation of ours and lead and take on \nthe great challenge of the 21st century, which is the national debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have more to say but my dear friends my colleagues are \nhere from all over the country to speak on this matter.\n  The first one is my dear friend from the First District of Kansas, a \nman who is no stranger to public service. He served his great State as \nLieutenant Governor and is now serving in the United States Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, he asked me to remind folks that he represents the great \nState of Kansas, and his alma mater, Kansas State, which upset the \nOklahoma University Sooners. They beat them three out of the last four \ntimes so that is pretty darn impressive. With that track record, please \nlend him your ears, my fellow Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).\n  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend from \nWest Texas, Red Raider, for yielding me time. I would say if K-State \ncan beat OU 3 of the last 4 years, certainly we can make massive \nprogress on this debt that we have racked up. Nothing is impossible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the excessive government funding \nat a time when inflation is skyrocketing, the supply chain is still \nstruggling to recover, and farmers are going out of business.\n  I look forward to the month of August every year because it gives me \nan extended period of time back home to visit with folks in my district \nand hear about their needs. This year, however, on August 12, Speaker \nPelosi called the House back into session to vote on a $700 billion \ntax-and-spend plan chock full of Green New Deal priorities. This so-\ncalled Inflation Reduction Act will do nothing to slow down inflation; \nit will only make it worse.\n  The bill contains countless reckless spending provisions such as: $80 \nbillion to hire 87,000 IRS agents, increasing audits on the middle \nclass and small businesses; spending more than $250 billion on Green \nNew Deal spending and a brand new $27 billion climate slush fund at the \nEPA; $12 billion in new taxes on oil and gas producers, expanding the \nsenseless war on producers of fossil fuels; $128 billion spent to \nexpand Obamacare subsidies.\n  As if this weren't enough, President Biden announced a plan just a \nfew weeks ago to forgive student loans for up to $20,000 per borrower \nwithout the approval of this Congress. Regardless of party, that is \nappalling.\n  This plan is obviously just campaigning utilizing taxpayer dollars. \nIt is ill-timed, shortsighted, and irresponsible. In light of the \nastronomically high inflation that our country is facing, the plan to \ncancel student loans will cost taxpayers more than $300 billion, \ntransferring the debt burden of borrowers to low- and middle-class \ntaxpayers. The Biden plan unfairly punishes Americans who have already \npaid their student loans or never attended college.\n  Government spending is set to expire tomorrow, September 30, and \nCongress will consider a stop-gap spending bill tomorrow morning to \nkeep this government operating again. Included in the bill is $1 \nbillion of spending to subsidize the home utility costs of low-income \nAmericans, when Biden's war on fossil fuels caused the utility costs to \nskyrocket in the first place.\n  There are better ways to solve most problems than simply throwing \nmoney at them, but that is all this administration seems to know how to \ndo.\n  Oddly enough, the one place where House Democrats and this \nadministration don't want to spend more money is on police. The brave \nmen and women who protect us all. It is truly unbelievable.\n  The picture here, overall, is one of wasteful spending, political \npandering that endangers Americans, carelessness, and shortsightedness. \nThis administration needs to wake up to the real problems facing \nAmerica and start offering practical solutions to pay down our debt \nbefore it is too late.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas.\n  I think it is important to be honest with the American people even if \nthe truth hurts.\n  When I am asked who caused this disastrous level of debt, this deep \nhole that we have dug for our children and grandchildren, I say that \nwhile the Democrats have certainly done a whole lot of spending beyond \nour ability to pay and beyond what I think is the appropriate scope and \nscale of the Federal Government, which I think should be targeted and \nlimited and focused on its mission, provide a common defense, and \nsecure the liberties of us and our posterity, I am quick to remind them \nthat Republicans have their fair share of blame.\n  And while I am celebrating the thought, the opportunity for \nRepublicans to be in the majority and to fulfill this commitment to \nAmerica, which includes curbing wasteful spending and ensuring that \nthis government is accountable to we the people, let's be honest. I was \nhere in the 115th Congress as a freshman, and I saw the contributions \nthat my party contributed to this. I saw us blow past the spending caps \nthat we voted for to constrain spending. I witnessed us put aside pay-\nfor provisions to offset these programs that we think are so important \nand necessary for taxpayers.\n  I even was part of the Budget Committee that in the second year \nwasn't able to pass the budget out of the committee, let alone this \nChamber.\n  So when we talk about the Democrats failing for the last 2 years to \neven pass a budget out of committee--which I am happy to say because it \nis the truth, and it is quite shameful for any party to not have a \nbudget, let alone live by it, like every American--we, as Republicans, \nhave made our contributions to this. And we ought to own it. We ought \nto feel the burn in our conscience until we actually unite as a party \nand reach across the aisle where we can to address, what I would call, \na curse on the next generation of Americans.\n\n  Ben Franklin--God bless him--said, `` . . . when you run in debt; you \ngive to another person power over your liberty.'' He said the second \nvice in public service is lying, the first is running up a debt.\n  I have got a good friend who I have come to respect tremendously, not \nonly for his service in the United States Congress but his service to \nour country as a foreign service officer. He is wicked smart, and a \ngreat patriot. Peter Meijer hails from the Third District of Michigan, \nfrom the Great Lake State.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer), to \nmake some comments on this important issue.\n  Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Arrington. I \nwish I had a witty sports rejoinder from Michigan to Texas, but I \nutterly lack that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the deeply troubling state of \nour Nation's finances. As Mr. Arrington has pointed out, at this \nmoment, the U.S. public debt stands at nearly $31 trillion or 122 \npercent of our Gross Domestic Product. Total debt service on this as of \nAugust of this year was $677 billion, which is more than we spent on \nnational defense in the 2017 fiscal year.\n  To put it another way, this current administration, despite all of \nthis, does not seem worried. In fact, they are enacting policies that \nwill only grow and exacerbate this problem.\n  This administration, with the assistance of the Senate and House \ncounterparts, passed both the American Rescue Plan and the \noxymoronically named Inflation Reduction Act through reconciliation \nwith absolutely zero communication across the aisle.\n\n[[Page H8301]]\n\n  Still, not satisfied with what they have been able to spend on a \nstrictly partisan basis in Congress, the administration has arrogated \nto itself sweeping fiscal powers under a national emergency which it \ncontinues to extend, not because the actual emergency persists, as the \nPresident has mentioned that the pandemic is over, but because they \nneed the money. And that is what the administration has chosen to do.\n  Our question is: With these emergency powers, what is their goal?\n  It is engineering one of the largest upward transfers of wealth in \nthe Nation's history. It is spending $400 billion--that is almost 2 \npercent of GDP--to pay down the loans of those who attended college.\n  It is important to keep in mind in the United States, the median \nhousehold income of a college graduate is over $100,000, significantly \nhigher than the median income of the American taxpayer, and nearly \ntwice the median household income of a family in my district.\n  Why are they doing this? Have college graduates been \ndisproportionately affected by this pandemic?\n  No, quite the opposite.\n  College grads have done relatively well compared to the rest of the \ncountry, many of whom could Zoom into work. They had the option of \nworking remotely. They were not laid off en masse.\n  The reason the Biden administration is choosing to do this is because \nit is what the Democratic Party does. They use control of the ever-\ngrowing State to tax their enemies and pay their friends.\n  President Biden, facing a historically unpopular moment, has a base \nthat is apathetic because he has failed to deliver the unrealizable \npromises that he made.\n  So the answer? A 2 percent of GDP gift to drive them to the polls. It \nis that simple.\n  After all this, there will still be losses, but once again, we will \nachieve nothing. And once again, we will have a bill that we will foot \nfor decades to come.\n  We must put an end to this type of governing.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for \nhis heartfelt comments and his deep concern for our country and our \nNation's future under this gigantic weight of $30-plus trillion in debt \nand this dark cloud and the clouds that gather.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have another dear friend and colleague who is very \npassionate about this issue. Certainly a patriot, served his country, \nserved the Lone Star in the House and Senate, and decided he would \nventure out here in Washington, D.C., to be another voice for the \nfreedom-loving, God-fearing people of Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), who I \nam honored and proud to serve alongside of.\n  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from West Texas for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, time and again, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have put our country in a financial choke hold.\n  Mr. Speaker, they believe that the only solution to fix any of our \ncountry's problems is to spend and to spend, and you know what, and \nspend even more.\n  Well, I have to ask: Where has that got us?\n  I will tell you where. On a road to financial oblivion.\n  Our Federal debt is approaching $31 trillion; that is 31,000 \nbillions. Our annual deficit was nearly $3 trillion in FY21, and I \nexpect a similar number at the end of FY22.\n  We are experiencing a 40-year high in inflation precisely because of \nthis runaway, reckless, and highly irresponsible government spending.\n  We are seeing higher prices that are disproportionately harming the \nworking poor and the middle class. And Americans are tired of spending \nover half their hard-earned paychecks just to pay for the basic \nnecessities of life.\n  This body never has had a revenue problem. This body has a spending \nproblem. It is an important distinction. And why?\n  You know, a school district can't spend more than it takes in. A city \ncan't. A county can't. A State can't. But the Federal Government does \nbecause they have a printing press down the street.\n  So what can be done? Because to be frank, when you talk to people at \nhome, they are starting to lose hope. Time is running out. And when you \nbecome addicted to deficit spending and, essentially, are enjoying a \ndollar's worth of goods and services and it is costing you 75 cents, it \nis hard to wean yourself off of that.\n  In effect, what Washington has done for far too long is mortgage our \nchildren's future for political expediency and benefit now, never \nconsidering what will become of our future generations.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  So what is the answer?\n  Actually, it is pretty simple. We should only spend what we take in, \nperiod, end of story, full stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, 27 years ago this very legislation, a balanced budget \namendment, passed out of this Chamber and exceeded the two-thirds \nthreshold, believe it or not. It only failed in the Senate by one vote, \nand it would have then been sent to the States.\n  So we must tackle this issue, Mr. Speaker, here and now. It shouldn't \nbe partisan. This is math. This isn't a Democratic solution, and this \nisn't a Republican solution. This is an American solution moving \nforward.\n  We can't tackle it tomorrow, and we can't tackle it next year. We \ncan't kick the can down the road. We need to tackle it now, today, this \nvery second.\n  Mr. Speaker, $31 trillion is a staggering debt that will eventually, \nand with absolute certainty, lead to American financial catastrophe. \nBut we can stop it. We just need to work together and inject fiscal \nsanity into this debate. We owe it to our children, we owe it to our \ncountry, and we owe it to our future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Arrington for letting me share remarks.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better myself, \nand I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  We need to harness that passion, and we need to unify not only our \nconference to lead by example but the entire United States Congress to \ntake this on.\n  We do have existential threats, like our adversary China. We have a \nnumber of threats, and we have to address them responsibly and with \nurgency. But I don't see a bigger, long-term threat that could just \nknock the shine plum off the shining city on the hill than this boulder \nthat is rolling downhill, this snowball that is going to impact every \naspect from national security to our economy to domestic tranquility--\nthe whole shooting match, as we say in Texas--if we don't step up and \nhave the courage to lead and to deliver for our children.\n  Speaking of children, I have a friend and colleague on the Ways and \nMeans Committee who has raised a family and is expecting to have his \nchildren inherit this American promise, this exceptional Nation, and \nthe future opportunities it affords our fellow countrymen. He ran a \nbusiness, a family-owned construction company. He has served at the \nlocal and county level. He has served in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania's Senate, and I believe he was the leader of the senate's \nbudget and finance committee, so this guy knows what he is talking \nabout.\n  I imagine when he was leading the charge for the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania in the senate they balanced their budgets, they paid their \ndebts, and they lived fiscally responsibly within their means because \nthat is what leaders do with other people's money.\n  I am proud to hand over the mike to Lloyd Smucker for his comments, \nand I thank him for his service.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSmucker).\n  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Arrington for leading this \ndiscussion tonight and for his kind comments.\n  It is interesting, my friend talks about Pennsylvania's budget, and I \nwas proud to serve there and be part of the process.\n  I thought it was a difficult and a broken process there. We would \npass a budget weeks beyond the deadline or sometimes months. There \nwould be vigorous discussions with the Governor on what that budget \nshould look like, but at the end of the day, we did it. My friend is \nexactly right. We passed a\n\n[[Page H8302]]\n\nbudget where expected revenues matched the appropriations that we put \nforward.\n  So it was a little unbelievable to come here and see that we haven't \ndone that in about, at least, 20 years here. We certainly haven't \nbalanced the budget in almost our lifetime here. And so as broken as I \nthought the process was at the State level, at least at the end of the \nprocess we had a product that balanced the budget.\n  So I want to just express my appreciation and thanks to Mr. Arrington \nfor leading this discussion. I share--as he knows, we have had \ndiscussions about this--the deep concerns for the current state of our \nNation's finances. We talk about this. We serve on the Ways and Means \nCommittee together, and I think Ways and Means Committee members \nunderstand the problems we are faced with if we don't address this.\n  I also serve on the Budget Committee, and there we talk about the \nproblems that we are faced with. But this has to extend beyond just \nthose two committees. It has to extend to our conference and also to \nthis entire body and entire system of government.\n  We need to be talking about how this impacts our constituents, how it \nimpacts people at home, and why they should care about this. Some \npeople maybe don't even understand that issues of Federal debt and \ndeficits even matter.\n  Sometimes I like to put it in simple terms. Think of our national \ndebt, say, like a balance on a credit card. We all do budgets in our \nhomes and in our businesses. But think about the national debt. We \ncan't even imagine the $30 trillion number which, by the way, is about \n$245,000 per American. But let's just talk about it as a credit card. \nEvery one of us will have to shoulder this debt at some point, and we \nare going to have to make sacrifices.\n  If you have credit card debt in your home, then you have to make \nsacrifices to pay it down. The higher the balance, the higher the \nminimum payment, meaning less money at the end of each month for things \nthat you would rather spend on than paying down and making that credit \ncard payment, like healthcare or saving for retirement, whatever it may \nbe.\n  If you don't pay down the balance--we haven't done that in a long \ntime here--it will affect your credit rating. You will become \nuncreditworthy. That will result in higher interest rates, and you will \nface more payments. It is a snowball effect. That credit rating will \nplummet. Not only will you pay more, but then no one will trust you \nwith a new loan. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the longer you wait to pay \ndown that credit card debt, the more it grows and grows and grows.\n  We should all care that every dollar the government spends should be \nspent responsibly. It is the taxpayers' money. The taxpayers earned it. \nWe should be responsible with their dollars. But we certainly haven't \nseen the Biden administration doing that. Biden's government has \naccrued $4.8 trillion in new debt since taking office. We now owe over \n$30 trillion in debt. That is $245,000 per taxpayer. The American \nRescue Plan, the inflation act, the student loan forgiveness, and many \nother misguided policies each drastically increase the role of \ngovernment in everyday American lives.\n  Biden's policies over the past year have incentivized people not to \nwork, rewarded those who have accrued college student loan debt on the \nbacks of those who have worked hard to pay off their own debt or \ntotally avoided debt and have weakened America's goal to be a symbol of \nfreedom in the world.\n  If we are going to defend the American Dream, then we must fix this \nproblem. We must fix actually the broken budget process here in \nCongress as well, which the gentleman has talked about.\n  This week we are, once again, going to fund the government on a \nmassive, short-term, continuing resolution loaded with irresponsible \nspending. Over the past 4 years of Speaker Pelosi's leadership in the \nHouse, House Democrats didn't pass a budget resolution by regular order \nexcept to push partisan reconciliation bills that have spent trillions \nof dollars.\n  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as Republicans, we have made a \ncommitment to Americans, our Commitment to America. And certainly all \nof us in this conference--certainly those of us in the Budget \nCommittee--will ensure that we do the work, we pass a budget on time \nand through regular order, and we stick to it. Republicans will commit \nto reducing our spending in order to preserve that American Dream that \nwe think is so important for future generations.\n  I thank Mr. Arrington for leading this, and I appreciate the \nopportunity to be a part of it.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Lloyd Smucker is my brother. We came in together and \nserved our first term in the 115th Congress. I know he is committed to \nthis. I am proud and confident in his leadership on the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I just, again, share the sentiment of my colleagues and the sense of \nurgency--the sense of urgency. This crisis, this debt-related crisis, \nis very different from any other crisis we have experienced, in that, \nfor example, with the pandemic and COVID, and the government's response \nto COVID which was sometimes the problem itself, but altogether, we \nwere able to borrow and print enough money to bail out of it. But when \nthe dominoes fall on a debt crisis, it doesn't matter how much China \nwill lend us. It doesn't matter how much the Federal Reserve prints. \nThey can print to their heart's desire. It won't fix it, and we will \nweaken this country, its global dominance, its global leadership, and \nthe values that America represents to the entire world.\n  So I am grateful to Mr. Smucker.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to another colleague on the Committee on Ways \nand Means and from the Keystone State, another proud citizen of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. This guy has run a business. I think I \nhave heard him say, and I will paraphrase, if he ran his business like \nthe knuckleheads in Congress run this country, he would have been \nbankrupt before he could ever make payroll, let alone make a living.\n  This is a man who is known for his Knute Rockne locker-room speeches \nlike they did there in Notre Dame. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, he can \nfire you up, and he has a fire in his belly. I guarantee you, Mr. \nSpeaker, when we get the majority--and I don't want to be presumptuous, \nI should say, God willing, if the people give us the majority--I know \nthat this man is going to be riding herd on our conference and the \nentire Congress to do the right thing. He has four children and 10 \ngrandchildren. That is what we call skin in the game.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), \nwho is my dear friend.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \nTexas for yielding.\n  I think at some time in whatever it is one does in life, there is a \nsaying: It is rug-cutting time.\n  What does that mean?\n  It means to face the reality of what is in front of you right now. \nDon't try to paper over it, don't try to dismiss it, and don't ever \nthink there is always going to be time sometime in the future to \naddress a crisis that you face today.\n  I brought with me a picture of an iceberg, and this is the way our \ndebt looks. You only see a very small portion above the surface, Mr. \nSpeaker. Most of the iceberg is below the surface.\n  We talk about kitchen table economics.\n  What do we mean by that?\n  Well, we tell people: Hey, do you know what? We had really good \nrevenues last year. It was $4.8 trillion.\n  People say: That sounds like a lot of money.\n  Yeah, but we went out, and we spent $6.1 trillion.\n  And they say: Oh, that doesn't sound like that much of a difference.\n  Kitchen table economics: You sit down with your wife. You look at \nwhat your earnings are, and you say: Well, gee, honey, we had a pretty \ngood year. We made $48,000.\n  She looks and says: That is a lot of money.\n  And you say: Yeah, but we spent $61,000.\n  It is like: Oh, my God, we couldn't have possibly done that.\n  What allows you to borrow more money than you should have?\n  It is irresponsible lending, and it is irresponsible spending. When \nthe United States of America makes a conscious decision to enter into \noverwhelming debt, then it will not only\n\n[[Page H8303]]\n\nrest on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren, it will rest \non us.\n  We talk about spending and we talk about the size of our debt, and we \nsay: Do you know what? In the last year and a half, it has gone up $9 \ntrillion.\n  So how much is that then?\n  Well, roughly about $31 trillion in the red.\n  But then we say: Yeah, but do you know what? That covers a certain \nportion of our debt.\n  What it doesn't take into consideration is our unfunded liabilities. \nWhen you add in the unfunded liabilities, it is a whopping 123 or $124 \ntrillion in debt. It is unimaginable. And if you could imagine it, Mr. \nSpeaker, you would never be able to lay your head on a pillow at night \nand say that things are pretty good.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  If we can't do this, we will just print more money. If you printed \nmore money in the private sector: irresponsible. That is called \ncounterfeiting. Why were we always so worried about counterfeiting? \nBecause the market would get flooded with paper that had no real value.\n  What in the living hell has happened to our citizens? More \nimportantly, what has happened to their leaders who they elected to \ncome here and act in their best interest?\n  We are at a titanic moment. Our country is steaming full speed ahead \nat an iceberg that will sink us. We live in the most dangerous times \nour country has ever seen.\n  Budgets are the key to being able to sleep soundly at night. Budgets \nare the plan that you put together where you understand what your \npotential earnings could be and, more importantly, what you want to \nspend. Nobody in the private sector would ever develop a plan like the \ngovernment does.\n  I was told when I first got here: Do you know your problem, Kelly? \nYou think that a government should be run like a private business.\n  My answer to that was: No, no, no. What I know for a fact is that no \nprivate business could be run the way a government is.\n  Why? When we pass these huge spending bills, whose pocket does it \ncome out of? Who pays every single penny of it? Who is looking at \nbalances that we can't possibly meet and irresponsibly still decides to \ndo that, oftentimes to gain the favor of our fellow citizens?\n  I hear constantly: Do you think we will get another check? Do you \nthink we will get more help? I don't need the money, but I will put it \nin a bank account. Do you think we will get that?\n  I said: I hope to heck you don't because the money that you got from \nthe government went on your total tax bill.\n  You do not ever receive anything from the United States Government, \nyour State government, or your local government that comes without a \nprice tag attached to it, and that price tag is attached to your \nwallet, and that wallet is suffering greatly under an unbelievable \nburden.\n  We sleep through this. We doze off. We refuse to believe where it is \nwe are going.\n  When I say we are steaming full speed ahead, and we are going to have \na titanic moment, anybody that understands what happened on the Titanic \nunderstands that the reason they had so many losses of life on the \nTitanic is they didn't have enough lifeboats to put passengers on.\n  This government is bankrupting America. Somebody said: Do you know \nwhat? I am worried about my grandchildren and even my children.\n  My answer to that is: Start worrying about yourself.\n  This is an imminent danger that lies right in front of us. Our \ninability to face it, our delusional belief that somehow everything is \nall right, and we are fuzzy, warm, and comfortable until the wolf comes \nto the door--what happened here? What happened to the greatest Nation \nthe world has ever known with the most potential the world has ever \nknown? The government decided that a lot of the assets we have, we are \nnot going to use them. We are going to go to a foreign source for \nenergy. Why would you use domestic energy? Why would you use something \nthat is right beneath your feet?\n  I hear all the time: Well, we are going to work on all of the above.\n  I said: That is fine, but let's not forget everything that is below. \nLet's understand what our assets are and understand that we are \ndrowning ourselves in debt.\n  I am accused sometimes of being too passionate, but I will tell you \nwhat, I will be damned if I am going to sit at the Thanksgiving table \nthis year and look at those 10 grandchildren and my 4 children and say: \nDo you know what? Your mother and I really love you, but we just don't \ncare about your future. We are cosigning your name to our debt. \nHopefully, we will be gone before you face that.\n  My friends, this is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democrat \nissue. This is not a red issue. This is not a blue issue. This is a \nred, white, and blue American issue.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side: Please don't accuse us of not \nwanting to work with you. For 2 years, we haven't been allowed to be at \nthe table. We haven't been allowed to be in the room. We have not been \nallowed to be in the building. We were not even allowed to be in the \ntown.\n  This false narrative that we will not reach across the aisle to work \ntogether, the one thing we will never do is to continue to damn our \nchildren and grandchildren and the future of this country with a debt \nthat is so large, so over-encompassing, that there will no longer be a \nUnited States of America.\n  Anybody who tells me it is okay to spend $61,000 a year because you \nmake $48,000, I would say you are a fool. We have been fools. Both \nsides of the aisle have spent unbelievable amounts of money that you \ncan't justify other than the fact that every 2 years, there is an \nelection. We try to put features and benefits together that will add \nvalue to who we are, knowing that it is a false narrative.\n  Our real challenge is not how much we spend. It is a matter that we \nrefuse to address the bankruptcy that we are facing and very soon.\n  The great State of Texas is always a place that we look for \nleadership and talk about: How did Texas get to be Texas? Because of \nstrong citizens.\n  I say to all of our colleagues: I don't care if you sit on the right \nside or the left side. Be on a side that is a responsible side.\n  If you can possibly say that what we are doing is fine and is in the \nbest interest of the future of this country, I would say you must be \nworking on some new math. You must be working out of some new program.\n  Nobody who has any sense, common sense, would look at what is going \non right now--please look at this iceberg. We are at a titanic moment. \nTurning your head away, refusing to listen, refusing to be responsible \nto our fellow citizens will cause this country to sink.\n\n  It is time to wake up, America. Forget about being woke. Wake up. We \nare facing an incredible challenge and the demise of the greatest \nNation the world has ever known.\n  I think the biggest part about life as you are growing up, you always \ntell your kids, don't ever bring shame on this family, and don't do \nirresponsible things that hurt not only yourself but others. The oath \nof office is one thing. There is another oath, and we answer to a much \nhigher power that someday we will face. We will be held accountable for \nour irresponsible actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order \nhour tonight. I hope our fellow citizens understand what exactly is \nhappening.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Mr. Kelly and proud to \ncall him a friend and colleague. I am going to shake his hand as he \nleaves.\n  Listen, this is what it is going to require. It is going to require \nthat level of push and punch and clawing and scratching, yelling if \nnecessary, kicking a chair over in the Chamber, and saying the House is \non fire. It is going to burn down before our children ever taste the \nsweetness of the blessed life in this country.\n  I believe we are going to do it. I believe in this country, and I \nbelieve that the American people, especially over the last couple of \nyears of this spending frenzy, are waking up to this.\n  One of the sinister elements of a debt crisis is you don't feel the \npain until you feel the pain. But once you feel the pain, it is too \nlate. The world cannot afford to have America in any position besides \nthe pole position for the sake of stability, freedom, and the \nfundamental rights of every human.\n\n[[Page H8304]]\n\n  Nobody knows that freedom is nothing without security more than a \nNavy fighter pilot who hails from the 25th District of California. He \nis an Iraq war veteran and was a State assemblyman. He flipped a seat \nthat was Democrat for years, probably over 20 years, not because he was \na great Republican but because he is a great man, and he is a great \nleader. He loves this country, and he just wants a safer, stronger, \nfreer Nation for his two boys.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia), \nmy friend.\n  Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \nTexas for hosting this very important hour.\n  I think what you have captured here in calling our Nation's debt a \ncurse is very important, very apropos. When you do the math with the \n$31 trillion worth of debt, that equates to roughly $94,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in the United States.\n  As a head of a household of four and the father of two young boys, 15 \nand 6 years old, I echo your sentiments that we cannot put this curse \non our children, our grandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, facts are cold, hard, stubborn things. In this world, it \ndoesn't matter what you hope for. It doesn't matter what you wish for. \nIt doesn't even matter what your intentions were, even if they were \nwell-meaning intentions. What matters are the results.\n  The results stemming from this tax-and-spend policy brought on by \nthis body, led by a very progressive majority with what I would submit \nare very regressive results, have resulted in a cold, hard reality for \nthe average American family.\n  Today's reality for the average middle-income, lower-class family is \none defined by record-high inflation, mortgage rates that are \nskyrocketing, retirement accounts that are down nearly 20 percent since \ntheir high was established in early 2021, and record debt. These are \nregressive economic indicators.\n  This reality is not just bad luck, Mr. Speaker, or the product of \nanything or anyone else besides your agenda to overtax and overspend, \nto overpromise and underdeliver.\n  Mr. Speaker, economics is simply physics with dollar signs. For every \naction, there is a reaction. For every input, there is an output. There \nare fundamental rules that don't bend to your desires, your hopes, or \nyour wishes. These are cold, hard facts and cold, hard rules, just like \nphysics.\n  With over $10 trillion now in obligations and liquidity injected into \nthe system by Congress in just the last 2 years, and a war on American \nenergy and a war on small business, the result is 40-year record \ninflation. That is a reaction as a result of an action.\n  With record-high inflation, the Fed is now forced to raise rates some \n400 basis points just in the last 6 months--again, action and reaction.\n  With Fed rates now going up so quickly, banks now have to likewise \nincrease their mortgage lending rates accordingly. Just 12 months ago, \na home buyer could get a 30-year loan for just 3 percent interest. \nToday, that same loan is now close to 7 percent. It prices half of the \nnew buyers out of the market--again, action and reaction.\n\n  Because people are suffering on a daily basis and can't afford to \nmake ends meet, much less purchase homes, especially first-time home \nbuyers, the housing market and the stock market are now pulling back \nsignificantly--action and reaction.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority and White House policies over the last 2 \nyears have tried to defy physics, and now gravity is taking over.\n  My constituents, especially in California, see $6 to $7 a gallon gas. \nEven if they have an electric vehicle, they pay close to $1,000 a month \nfor their electricity bills. Groceries, school supplies, clothes, \neverything is about 15 to 20 percent higher than it was just 2 years \nago.\n  They are actually afraid to look at their 401(k)'s or their \nretirement accounts because they have lost so much. Californians are \ngetting especially crushed.\n  To pull out of this nosedive, we need to cut spending, like my \ncolleague from Texas has stated several times, and Congress needs to \nbalance its budget. We need to stop adding to the debt and stop adding \nmore risk to our children's economic futures.\n  We need to actually be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and be \nresponsible with it. We need to shrink Federal agencies and hold them \naccountable to higher efficiencies.\n  We need to cut taxes so Americans can keep more of their money and so \nsmall businesses can afford to hire and grow.\n  More importantly, Mr. Speaker, we need to listen to our constituents \nand those in our communities who create jobs, instead of punishing them \nfor the majority's hopes and wishes that defy physics.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The poorer families are the ones getting hammered the most because of \nit. Congress can do and has done better--and we will again when we get \nthe majority back.\n  The United States can do and has done better, and we will again. The \nbest times and the greatest prosperity are ahead of us as a Nation, but \nonly as long as we as legislators respect the laws and fundamentals of \nthe economy.\n  Like I said, it is just physics with dollar signs, Mr. Speaker, and \nto fight those physics is folly. To add to our debt is reckless. Our \ndebt now has become an existential threat to the Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, Democrats have failed middle-class families with these \npolicies, but now a new majority will come in, elected by those hurt \nthe most, the middle class, the lower income families, and we will fix \nthis problem. Again, that is an action and reaction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for hosting this and \neducating Congress. I think most Americans realize the fundamental \nphysics of all of this, and we have to just teach our colleagues to \nimplement them and save our country from this very crushing debt.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, that was well said by my friend, \nRepresentative Garcia. I thank him for his service to the country in \nthe Navy and in the United States Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am inspired tonight. I am inspired by my colleagues \nwho are ready to fight by taking on the tough issues, making the tough \ndecisions, and exercising the courage that every leader in this country \nhas that ever did anything meaningful for this great Nation, and for \ntheir posterity. We are ready for this.\n  I know one man has got a lot of fight in him; he is a warrior from \nWisconsin. He is a man that is no stranger to the budget, to the budget \nprocess, and to the broken and dysfunctional dynamics and elements of \nthe budget process in this place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for Glenn Grothman from the great State of \nWisconsin representing the Sixth District.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nGrothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there are so many things we can talk \nabout, so many challenges for the American people over the next few \nmonths as they try to restore America to its place as the envy of the \nworld, a great country.\n  We could be talking about immigration and 150,000 people a month \ncrossing the border. We could talk about the divisive rhetoric from way \ntoo many Democrats finding racism here, there, and everywhere, and \nblaming all of America's problems on racism.\n  We could be talking about other problems. But tonight we are going to \nbe talking about the ridiculous amount of overspending, which is \ndebasing the value of the dollar and resulting in the inflation that is \nhurting and harming American families so much, be it the cost of cars, \nbe it the cost of food, be it the cost of energy.\n  America must not forget where this inflation came from. It came from \nthe American Rescue Plan, one of the first bills passed under President \nBiden. It was continued by the infrastructure bill, another over $1 \ntrillion of spending. And, finally, the reduce inflation act, another \n$700 billion. This is in addition to the large increases in the regular \nbudgets Congress always passes.\n  We have been out of control on the regular budgets, and now you hear \nthese three additional bills, which are causing the huge increases in \nprices that you see at the gas pump, but even more at the grocery store \nand at restaurants, and when you are looking to buy a house or rent.\n\n[[Page H8305]]\n\n  Where did this come from? It is not a natural thing to happen.\n  It came because of out-of-control spending on all three of these \nbills. And worse, in addition to the out-of-control spending leading to \nthe inflation, we have where the money went. We are spending more and \nmore money on programs conditioned upon not working very hard, programs \nconditioned to take the benefit of not getting married.\n  So in addition to, I assume, intentional desire to debase the \ncurrency, we continue down the path of moral decline as we encourage \nmoney to be spent in the wrong place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage the American people in the future, when you \ndecide how you want your country governed, when you go to your \nRepresentative's office hours back home, when you call your \nCongressman, ask them: Where do you stand on these big spending \nprograms? And now we have another one coming down the pike, another \n$400 billion in student loan debt forgiveness.\n  Where is that money going to come from?\n  I will tell you where the money is going to come from. To a certain \nextent it is going to be paid by future generations, but more \nimmediately it is going to be paid for by the American public again. \nThe $400 billion will result in higher gas prices, higher food prices, \nhigher automobile prices--that is where the money is going to come \nfrom.\n  Wake up, America, these things are not free. The politicians who have \npassed these programs in the past are responsible for the additional \namount of money we are spending.\n  There are a variety of things that we could look at. We worry so much \nabout this great America that was built by our ancestors, all the \npeople who died in the wars, that we may have this great, free country, \nand we see it slipping away as we have out-of-control politicians--as \npeople frequently say happens in democracies--politicians buying votes \nby spending more money on everybody under the sun. That is where this \ninflation comes from.\n  Please, America, wake up. Like I said, we could talk about what is \ngoing on at the border. We could talk about inflation. We could talk \nabout the attack on the police, and with the attacks on the police the \ninevitable rise in crimes because the police are afraid to do what they \nwant.\n\n  Tonight, we talk about the out-of-control spending as way too many \nAmericans, including a lot of businesses, by the way, again and again \ncome to their Congressmen and ask for more free money. It wasn't free. \nI hope the next time you go to the grocery store or the next time you \ngo to buy a new car and you see the huge sticker shock, you remember \nthe politicians who are bragging about all the new money they are \nspending.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin and I am \ngrateful for his courage. He speaks truth. He is not up here to win \nfriends and influence people; he is up here to make sure the outcomes \nof our decisions are in the best interests of our country. And \ncertainly bending the curve on spending, reining in our debt, and \nrestoring fiscal responsibility is at the top of his list.\n  America is counting on him, and I am, too--as a senior Member of this \nbody when we get the majority--to remind every single Republican and \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle what is at stake. If we \ndon't, what is at stake? I thank Mr. Grothman.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 1\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, we timed it perfectly. I will just wind \ndown and then I will wind up the next speaker and dear friend and \nfellow Texan.\n  James Madison, I think, summarized it in his statement: A public debt \nis a public curse, and in a Republican form of government, the worst of \nits kind.\n  That cloud hanging over the heads of our children, that snowball \ncoming down the mountain, that is the 21st century challenge. That is \nthe bankrupting of our children's future by spending our country into \noblivion.\n  It is our great challenge and we enter it with sober minds and with \nprayerful hearts that God would give us the courage to take on the \nforces in our own party and in this building and outside this building, \nand anything that stands in our way until we reverse the curse, and we \ncan look into our children's eyes and we can tell them we have handed \nthem this country better than we found it, like every generation of \ngreat leaders for this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, now I get to sit and listen to a great fighter for \nfreedom, my fellow Texan (Mr. Roy).\n  God bless America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  September 29, 2022, on page H8305, in the second column, the \nfollowing appeared: God bless America. -------------\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: God bless \nAmerica.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, this is the third time I come to the floor \nto protect our Supreme Court Justices and their families. Speaker \nPelosi said this bill would come to the floor this week, but it is not \nlisted on our schedule.\n  The Speaker also said last week in her press conference that ``no one \nis in danger. . . .''\n  Think about that, Mr. Speaker. The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, last week, in a press conference, said no one is in \ndanger. This is just after a day or 2 when a man came clear across the \ncountry from California to kill Justice Kavanaugh. He was on the \nstreet, had a weapon. He had zip ties. He had a plan.\n  At the same time, the Speaker says no one is in danger. But at the \nsame time, the Senate already unanimously passed a bill with agreement \nfrom all 100 Senators. That wasn't passed last week; that was last \nmonth.\n  For 1 month, the majority of this House, Mr. Speaker, has held that \nbill,\n\n[[Page H5450]]\n\na bill that every single Senator, Republican and Democrat and \nIndependent, passed in the Senate. It simply states that we will \nprotect the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, you have probably noticed, as you came on to this \nCapitol, the intensity of force you see out in front of the Capitol. Is \nthat because something is happening here today? No. It is in \nanticipation of a decision by the Supreme Court.\n  Everybody in the country knows that there could be a decision--not \nknowing which way it would go--but the anticipation is that people need \nprotection in the Capitol.\n  At the same time that is happening, that you are protecting the \nCapitol, you are holding a bill to deny protection to those Justices.\n  It makes me wonder why. Why? Why, if 100 Senators approve it, would \nit hold here for an entire month?\n  Why, even after holding it for a month, somebody travels all the way \nacross the country with one thing in mind, to kill a Supreme Court \nJustice, gets arrested, and still the Speaker of the House will not \nmove that bill that the majority actually holds?\n  Just so the country can understand, no one on this side of the aisle, \nthe Republican side of the aisle, objects to this bill. We agreed that \nwe would agree to a unanimous consent.\n  All somebody had to do was make the motion and that could be on the \nPresident's desk; it could be signed; and they could be protected.\n  But for some reason, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats on the other side of \nthe aisle, even though 100 Senators had agreed with us, everyone in \nyour party on the Senate side said ``yes,'' you still say ``no.''\n  I do not understand that. I do not understand why we would risk that. \nI do not understand why you will make sure the Capitol is protected \nright now, knowing that something could happen in the Supreme Court \nthis week, but you won't protect those Justices.\n  Now, the Speaker came to the floor at a press conference last week \nand said nobody, no one, is in danger. How can you make that statement \nin the same week someone is arrested in your neighborhood trying to \nkill you? It makes no sense.\n  Mr. Speaker, if for some reason that we continue to come to the \nfloor, that you feel some pressure on that bill, but you change it, the \ncountry will know why because if you change the bill and move it back \nto the Senate, you are trying to kill it. You are trying to delay it. \nThat is exactly what you are doing.\n  You can take a bill that every single Senator voted for and send it \nto the President to be signed. If you think something else needs to be \nadded, run it by itself.\n  But if you want to ping-pong it and delay the process, I think that \nis wrong. I think you are jeopardizing people's lives. I think you are \njeopardizing the safety of the Supreme Court. I think you are playing \nmore games than anybody in this country can understand, and we do not \nunderstand why because there has been no clear answer.\n  Why would you hold the bill for more than a month?\n  Why would you hold the bill after somebody is arrested who traveled \nacross the country to kill a Justice? Why would you continue to hold \nthe bill now?\n  If you change it, you are showing the country what you really \nbelieve. You don't want the bill to pass. You want to delay it longer.\n  There is no excuse. There is no reason to delay this bill. This \nshould be law, and the Justices should be protected.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table \nS. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act, and ask for immediate \nconsideration in the House.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of \nJanuary 10, 2022, the House is in session solely for the purpose of \nconducting morning-hour debate. Therefore, that unanimous consent \nrequest cannot be entertained.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, later in this day, it could. There is no \nexcuse why this bill continues to be held, and there will be no excuse \nif you try to change it to delay it. That is just a tactic, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I believe you thought it would be wrong as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-06-22"}

Res. 713\n\n       Whereas the Russian Federation's illegal, premeditated, \n     unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine includes \n     extensive, systematic, and flagrant atrocities against the \n     people of Ukraine;\n       Whereas article II of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (in this preamble \n     referred to as the ``Genocide Convention''), adopted and \n     opened for signature in 1948 and entered into force in 1951, \n     defines genocide as ``any of the following acts committed \n     with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, \n     ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing \n     members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental \n     harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on \n     the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its \n     physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing \n     measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) \n     Forcibly transferring children of the group to another \n     group'';\n       Whereas, on October 3, 2018, the Senate unanimously agreed \n     to Senate Resolution 435, 115th Congress, which commemorated \n     the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor and ``recognize[d] the \n     findings of the Commission on the Ukraine Famine as submitted \n     to Congress on April 22, 1988, including that `Joseph Stalin \n     and those around him committed genocide against the \n     Ukrainians in 1932-1933' '';\n       Whereas substantial and significant evidence documents \n     widespread, systematic actions against the Ukrainian people \n     committed by Russian forces under the direction of political \n     leadership of the Russian Federation that meet one or more of \n     the criteria under article II of the Genocide Convention, \n     including--\n       (1) killing members of the Ukrainian people in mass \n     atrocities through deliberate and regularized murders of \n     fleeing civilians and civilians in passing as well as \n     purposeful targeting of homes, schools, hospitals, shelters, \n     and other residential and civilian areas;\n       (2) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the \n     Ukrainian people by launching indiscriminate attacks against \n     civilians and civilian areas, conducting willful strikes on \n     humanitarian evacuation corridors, and employing widespread \n     and systematic sexual violence against Ukrainian civilians, \n     including women, children, and men;\n       (3) deliberately inflicting upon the Ukrainian people \n     conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical \n     destruction in whole or in part, including displacement due \n     to annihilated villages, towns, and cities left devoid of \n     food, water, shelter, electricity, and other basic \n     necessities, starvation caused by the destruction of \n     farmlands and agricultural equipment, the placing of Russian \n     landmines across thousands of acres of useable fields, and \n     blocking the delivery of humanitarian food aid;\n       (4) imposing measures intended to prevent births among the \n     Ukrainian people, demonstrated by the Russian military's \n     expansive and direct targeting of maternity hospitals and \n     other medical facilities and systematic attacks against \n     residential and civilian areas as well as humanitarian \n     corridors intended to deprive Ukrainians of safe havens \n     within their own country and the material conditions \n     conducive to childrearing; and\n       (5) forcibly mass transferring millions of Ukrainian \n     civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom are children, to the \n     Russian Federation or territories controlled by the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas the state-level intent of the Russian Federation in \n     favor of those heinous crimes against humanity has been \n     demonstrated through frequent pronouncements and other forms \n     of official communication denying Ukrainian nationhood and \n     sovereignty, including President Putin's ahistorical claims \n     that Ukraine is part of a ``single whole'' Russian nation \n     with ``no historical basis'' for being an independent \n     country;\n       Whereas some Russian soldiers and brigades accused of \n     committing war crimes in Bucha, Ukraine, and elsewhere were \n     rewarded with medals by President Putin;\n       Whereas the Russian state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti \n     published the article ``What Should Russia do with Ukraine'', \n     which outlines ``de-Nazification'' as meaning ``de-\n     Ukrainianization'' or the destruction of Ukraine;\n       Whereas article I of the Genocide Convention confirms \n     ``that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in \n     time of war, is a crime under international law which [the \n     Contracting Parties] undertake to prevent and to punish''; \n     and\n       Whereas although additional documentation and analysis of \n     atrocities committed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine may \n     be needed to punish those responsible, the substantial and \n     significant documentation already undertaken, combined with \n     statements showing intent, compel urgent action to prevent \n     further acts of genocide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Russian Federation for committing acts of \n     genocide against the Ukrainian people;\n       (2) calls on the United States, in cooperation with allies \n     in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European \n     Union, to undertake measures to support the Government of \n     Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against \n     the Ukrainian people; and\n       (3) supports tribunals and international criminal \n     investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military \n     personnel to account for a war of aggression, war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of the \nSenate and the American people to a dark anniversary on the near \nhorizon.\n  On July 24, the world will have seen 5 full months of the brutal, \nunjustified, and utterly senseless war Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin \nhas unleashed on Ukraine, a peace-loving democracy that has never \nthreatened Russia or any of its other neighbors.\n  It will be 150 days of Mr. Putin and his army's killing and raping \nUkrainian women and children; destroying homes, hospitals, museums, \nschools, and churches; displacing almost 13 million people; and \nunleashing chaos and havoc on the world. The blockage of the southern \nports of Ukraine has interrupted the vital supply of Ukrainian food \nsupplies to a hungry world, wreaking pain and havoc on societies across \nthe Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. An existing global food \nsecurity crisis has now been severely worsened by Russia's violent \nassault, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee examined earlier \ntoday in a hearing where USAID Administrator Samantha Power and our \npermanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda \nThomas-Greenfield, testified. They spoke about the U.S. role in trying \nto avert this additional global tragedy resulting from Russia's \naggression and the immensity of the task ahead.\n  Who could forget the horrors of Bucha and Irpin, the shell-shocked \nlook in the eyes of Ukrainian children who will forever carry the \nburdens of unimaginable trauma or the Ukrainian women who had to be \ncarried from a maternity ward after the Russians struck their hospital \nwith a cruise missile.\n  This is an everyday reality now for Ukrainians--unspeakable, cruel \nmilitary assaults. Yet they demonstrate the indomitable will to fight \nfor their land and freedom; they do not give up; and they are truly an \ninspiration for the rest of the world.\n  When Mr. Putin started this attack, he assumed Russia would conquer \nUkraine and seize its capital in 3 days. Yet it is now day almost 150, \nand Russia has suffered heavy losses and retreated from Kyiv. While \nseveral towns in the south of the country have been flattened and then \noccupied, in most of the country, the Russian invaders have barely \nadvanced from their initial positions.\n  In the towns and cities the Russians occupy, they have met heavy \nresistance from Ukrainian guerillas and regular citizens who do not \nwant to be part of Putin's evil empire. Despite efforts to indoctrinate \nUkrainian children in occupied areas with a counterfactual narrative of \nthe contemporary history, Russian speakers are learning Ukrainian, and \nwhat have been generally positive relations with the people of Ukraine \nand Russia before this invasion have now been completely destroyed.\n  Independent analysts have described the ongoing violence as a \ngenocide in\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nUkraine, and there is a growing body of evidence that it is, sadly, \ntrue. A May of 2022 study conducted by the New Lines Institute and the \nRaoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights concluded that ``Russia bears \nState responsibility for breaches of Article II and Article III of the \nGenocide Convention.''\n  The report pointed to a pattern of Russian forces targeting the \nUkrainian civilians, with evidence of mass executions and torture of \ncivilians in Russian-occupied regions. The report included evidence of \ndeliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes, and humanitarian \ncorridors, as well as reports of sexual violence and forcible \ndeportation of Ukrainians to Russia.\n  On July 14, the United States and 44 other nations signed an \nInternational Criminal Court declaration to investigate over 20,000 \nreports--20,000 reports--of war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine \nsince the beginning of the war.\n  Make no mistake about it, Vladimir Putin has caused the suffering and \npain in pursuit of his ambition to rebuild the Russian Empire. He has \nsaid it to himself on multiple occasions. He is hell-bent on destroying \nthe post-World War II world order that has brought prosperity and peace \nto our allies in Europe--and to Russia to this point, too.\n  Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that the Ukrainians are \nfighting not just for their land and freedom, which, as Americans, we \nshould cherish and appreciate, but also for the very core of the global \norder that, if destroyed, will marginalize our allies and threaten the \nUnited States.\n  With this in mind, we must remember that supporting Ukraine is not \ncharity. It is in our core national security interest to provide the \nUkrainians with the arms, financing, and moral support to defeat the \ntyrant of Russia. If Ukraine falls, it will lead to the subjugation of \nUkrainian people, destruction of its culture and language, and bring a \nhostile and expansionistic Russian Empire right to the borders of our \nNATO allies that we are committed to protect with our troops and \nweapons. Ukraine is the firewall that the world cannot afford to see \nbreached.\n  So, yes, it is a moral imperative for us to support Ukrainians in \nthis just war, but it is also a core national security necessity for us \nto do this. Ukraine is fighting this war on multiple fronts: on land \nand at sea and in the air. The security of the Black Sea region is a \ncritical aspect of this war that has not received enough attention. As \nrecent reporting suggests, the ability of the Ukrainians' vessels to \nnavigate the Black Sea is important for the country but also for \nregional stability and global food security. That is where Ukraine \nexports most of its agricultural products. Ukraine is a major grain \nexporter, and the Russians have been blocking these vessels from \ndeparting Ukrainian ports. This exposes some of the world's most \nvulnerable people to food scarcity, malnutrition, and worsening \npoverty--and in some cases leading to unnecessary and preventable \ndeaths. Truly, the ugliness and depravation of the Putin regime has no \nlimit.\n  It is in this context the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe that I chair conducted a field hearing on Black Sea security \nin Constanta, Romania, on July 1. I want to thank my friend Senator \nWicker for chairing that hearing. The Commission brought together key \ndecisionmakers from the Black Sea states to discuss how best to address \nRussia's illegal naval blockade of Ukrainian ports.\n  Subsequently, Senator Wicker and I joined Senators Shaheen and Romney \nin introducing the Black Sea Security Act, S. 4509. This bill would \ndeclare that it is the policy of the United States ``to actively deter \nthe threat of further Russian escalation in the Black Sea region and \ndefend freedom of navigation in the Black Sea to prevent the spread of \nfurther armed conflict in Europe.''\n  The bill further requires that the National Security Council shall \ndeliver to Congress an interagency report that outlines current policy \noptions toward Black Sea countries and the border region. The report \nwould include a breakdown of funding to support these efforts, \nincluding military assistance; economic assistance, including support \nfor food security; countering Russia's disinformation and propaganda; \nenergy diversification; increasing access to global capital markets; a \nplan for helping U.S. allies in the region to accelerate their \ntransitions from legacy Russian military equipment and promote NATO \ninteroperability; and strengthening the rule of law and anticorruption \nefforts.\n  I call on my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Tragically, this war is turning into a marathon, and it is incumbent \nupon us not to lose our focus and determination in supporting our \nUkrainian partners. I want to urge my colleagues in this Chamber and \nall my fellow Americans to stay the course and continue to support \nUkraine for as long as it takes.\n  My final point today is that we should say the name of what Russia is \ndoing, the atrocities they are committing. Russia is committing \ngenocide in Ukraine. Russia is trying to eviscerate not just the people \nand the buildings of Ukraine; they are trying to eliminate the \nUkrainian language, Ukrainian history, and Ukrainian culture. That is \ngenocide.\n  That is why I am joining Senator Risch, along with Senators Graham, \nBlumenthal, Shaheen, and Portman in introducing a resolution that would \ncondemn the Russian Federation for committing acts of genocide against \nthe Ukrainian people; call on the United States, in cooperation with \nallies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European \nUnion, to undertake measures to support the Government of Ukraine to \nprevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people; \nand support tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold \nRussian political leaders and military personnel to account for a war \nof aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n  We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians to lighten \ntheir load and hasten their victory. We must be prepared for the \nreconstruction of Ukraine that will follow the conclusion of this war. \nAnd, yes, we must pursue accountability for those responsible for the \ngenocide underway in Ukraine by the Russian Federation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-07-28"}

Madam President, $847 billion is a lot of money to spend \non anything in 1 year, even in Washington terms. It is enough money, \nfor instance, to make sure that not a single child goes hungry anywhere \nin the world ever again. It is enough money to end homelessness in \nAmerica, provide free preschool and college for every American, build \nhigh-speed rail between every American city, and make childcare free \nfor families.\n  Frankly, come up with five problems that plague parts of the world or \nparts of the country, design a solution, and you could probably solve \nall five for a year for $847 billion.\n  Here is another number that is big: $80 billion. Now, that is smaller \nthan $847 billion but still a lot of money.\n  For $80 billion, you could build a high-speed railroad from New York \nto Washington, you could build 4,000 brandnew, state-of-the-art high \nschools in underserved communities, or you could hire--wait for it--a \nmillion public school teachers.\n  Here is why I tell you this. Next week, likely, this body is \napparently going to be on a glidepath to pass an $847 billion Defense \nbudget authorization for the current fiscal year. That is an $80 \nbillion increase over last year. That is a 10-percent increase in just \n1 year.\n  There has been very little public debate, and there is going to be \nvery little debate on this floor over whether this is a good idea, \nabout whether we should spend $80 billion on this or whether that $80 \nbillion would be spent better on something else.\n  There is no debate, and there is going to be little debate here, in \npart, because the process of passing this bill is pretty broken.\n  Thanks to Senator Reed, the Armed Services Committee is a functioning \ncommittee. The Democrats and Republicans on that committee write this \nbill together with an open amendment process. If you are a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, thanks to Senator Reed and Senator \nInhofe's leadership, you have a lot of opportunities to weigh in on the \nsize and scope of the U.S. defense budget.\n  But the problem begins once the bill leaves the Armed Services \nCommittee. Then the bill kind of disappears and gets changed. That is \nnot Chairman Reed's fault. That is our collective decision to endorse \nthat process.\n  The first thing that happens, particularly this year, is that many, \nmany big, important pieces of policy get added to the Defense bill. \nSome of them are good policy, but some of them aren't. But there is no \ndemocratic process in which Members of this body get to review what is \nadded to the Defense bill. There is no notification of rank-and-file \nMembers so that we can provide input.\n\n  Again, as I understand it, the Armed Services Committee doesn't want \nto be in this position. They would rather just have a vote on their \noriginal bill, as we did for decades until just recently, when all of \nthis extra policy got added to the Defense bill. But because today \nthere are so few avenues for that other legislation to find a path to \nthe floor, in large part because Republicans are using the filibuster \nto clog up the floor of the Senate, the Defense bill becomes this kind \nof evacuation helicopter carrying all the passengers they can fit in \nit.\n  For the first time this year, there are more pages in the Defense \nbill dedicated to nondefense items than to defense items.\n  This might be acceptable if Senators could offer amendments on the \nfloor, remove parts of the bill we don't like, make other parts \nbetter--at least have our day. But the other new normal here is that \nthere is going to be zero amendments, amendment votes, likely in the \nSenate debate.\n  It is the same problem. There are a handful of Republicans here who \ndon't want to legislate, and so they are likely going to refuse to give \nconsent to vote on amendments, and, plus, as I mentioned, they clog up \nthe floor with filibuster votes, which means that you can't get big, \nimportant pieces of legislation done, and so they all find their way \nonto the Defense bill.\n  But I just want to plead with my colleagues for a moment that there \nis a better way to do this. We don't have to look too far in the past \nto see what a real debate on the Defense bill could look like. I just \nwant all of my colleagues to think how much more interesting this place \nwould be, how much healthier the Senate would be if we\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\ncould have debates on Defense bills that looked like they did just 20 \nyears ago.\n  I was just curious. So I literally just picked a year out of a hat \nfrom a slightly different generation in the Senate. I swear, I didn't \ncherry-pick the year. I just went back to 2000--the year 2000, right--a \nnice convenient date.\n  For the fiscal year 2000 Defense bill debate--which by the way, \nhappened in May, not in December--the Senate took rollcall votes on 13 \namendments. There were many amendments on contested, controversial \npolicy that got full debate and full votes, and there were a whole \nbunch of other amendments that got voice votes in the Senate. But on \nthe amendments that got full debate on the Senate floor and rollcall \nvotes, there was an 87-12 vote on the legality of a new NATO strategic \nplan, a 49-50 vote to compel information from the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services on welfare reform, 48-52 on a War Powers Resolution \nfor the war in the Balkans, 90-0 on a measure to encourage Balkan war \ncrimes prosecution, 52-47 on a contested military promotion case, 40-60 \nto authorize a new round of base closures, 44-56 on a nuclear weapon \nretirement policy, 49-51 and then 51-49 to remove restrictions on \nprison labor products, 49-51 to remove restrictions on abortions on DOD \nproperty, 21-77 to limit funding for the Balkan war, 11-87 to limit the \ncost of the F-18 program, and 98-0 to support sanctions on Libya.\n  That is a lot of debate on really important foreign policy and \nnational security policy on the floor of the Senate. That is virtually \nunthinkable in the modern Senate, and we are all poorer for it.\n  Back then, every Senator--not just leadership--saw themselves as \nhaving a coequal responsibility to set U.S. defense policy, and they \nrequired the process on the floor to reflect that belief.\n  In just that 1 year, 2000, Senators took three votes on the Balkan \nwar, a vote on fighter costs, a vote on base closures, sanctions, and \nmilitary promotions.\n  I go through this exercise just to explain to my colleagues that it \njust doesn't have to be like this. Those of us not on the Armed \nServices Committee or not in leadership don't have to be relegated to \n70 rubberstamps with virtually no ability to have meaningful, realtime \nimpact on the bill once it emerges from committee.\n  But I make this point for another reason as well. When there is \nlimited debate and limited input from rank-and-file Members on a bill \nthis big, on policy this important, I would argue that we miss the \nopportunity to be able to step back from this year-to-year creep of \nexisting policy and ask ourselves: Are we doing it right?\n  Are we spending hundreds of billions of dollars in a way that \nactually protects this country and our national interests; or are we \nsimply continuing down a path, continuing to invest and overinvest in \nweapons of war and underinvest in the tools that are necessary to \nprevent war?\n  And $847 billion is a ton of money, but so is $80 billion, this \nyear's increase in authorized defense spending.\n  Now, let me say this: There is no doubt that there are legions of \nmeritorious programs in this defense budget. Frankly, I publicly and \nproudly support many programs that are built and constructed in \nConnecticut: our submarine fleet, our helicopters, our fighter engines.\n  Why? Because I really do believe that the United States is the \nworld's defender of democracy, the defender of the rule of law, the \ndefender of international norms and free navigation. We have to be the \nworld leader in kinetic, hard military power.\n  Ukraine is an example of why conventional military might still \nmatters. Big nations, like Russia and China, are not content any longer \nto stay inside their boxes. They are, like pre-World War II times, \nseeking to revise their borders through invasion; and while the United \nStates is currently at no risk of being invaded ourselves, we do still \nhave a responsibility to step up and help others, to help reinforce \nthat post-World War II order to ensure that wars of aggression do not \nbecome normalized.\n  But that post-World War II order is under threat not just because \ncountries like Russia and China are using or threatening to use their \nmilitaries with alarming new frequency. The lion's share of threats to \nthe United States and threats to world stability are often referred to \nnot as conventional military threats but what is commonly referred to \nas asymmetric threats.\n  Now, this generally means they are threats that cannot be addressed \njust through military power--air power, armies, nuclear weapons, the \nkind of things that are funded in this Defense bill.\n  Let me give you some examples. Thousands of pages of think tank \nreports and endless hours of congressional testimony are dedicated to \nthis lament that China's influence around the world is growing due to \nits willingness to aggressively invest in developing economies, \ncritical mineral supplies, and supply chain routes. For instance, today \nChina owns over 100 different international ports. They own a hundred \nports outside of China in 60 different countries.\n  A new study revealed that China's development bank lent more money in \nsub-Saharan Africa than the development banks of the United States, \nGermany, Japan, and France combined. Now, to fix this, we need to be \ngrowing the size of U.S. development finance. But it is like pulling \nteeth to get Congress to extend the authorities or borrowing and \ncapital limitations of the U.S. International Development Finance \nCorporation.\n  Last year, DFC announced that it had lent more money than any year \nbefore: $7.4 billion. That is a lot of money, $7.4 billion. This July, \nChina's largest development bank announced that its 6-month total for a \ntargeted set of urban infrastructure loans in the developing world, \njust a tiny piece of their overall portfolio, was $27 billion.\n  U.S. development finance isn't even playing in the same ballpark as \nChinese development finance.\n  Here is another example of asymmetric power: It is kind of cliche \nthese days to remind policymakers that information is power. But \nUkraine's democracy is not just under attack from a foreign army; it is \nalso under attack from misinformation. China, Russia, Iran, nonstate \nactors, they are spending billions of dollars all over the world \nspreading messages into democracies to try to create division and \nundermine faith in the rule of law.\n  That controversy around Colin Kaepernick's protest, that was mostly a \ncreation of 500 Russian internet bots who posted an incredible 12,000 \ntweets inflaming public opinion.\n  China's global disinformation campaign is equally robust. For \ninstance, the largest backer of Philippines' President--former \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte's illegal assassination campaign? Chinese \nsocial media farms.\n  But, once again, the United States just chooses asymmetry by letting \nthese countries--Russia and China and others--dominate the information \nspace.\n  Here is an example: the budget for RT, just one of Putin's \ninternational television and online news operations, $2.8 billion; the \nbudget for the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which funds all of our \noverseas broadcasting, $1 billion.\n  How do you compete with those kind of funding discrepancies?\n  Here is one more example. A few years ago, I was in Dublin, \ncoincidentally, at the same time of a major telecommunications contract \ntender in Ireland. Ireland was making this key decision to award its \ninternet backbone to a European firm or to Huawei, the Chinese \ncommunications conglomerate.\n  I was told by a very competent but, frankly, very overwhelmed defense \nattache assigned to our Irish Embassy that, over the prior few months, \nthe Chinese Embassy had grown by leaps and bounds as dozens of new \nChinese diplomats and provocateurs arrived in town to try to help sway \nthe award for Huawei. Now, matched up against this legion of Chinese \ndiplomats was this one guy, our single defense attache, maybe supported \nby a couple diplomats in the Embassy.\n  Now, he was competent, but he had no background in telecommunications \npolicy--and, frankly, really nobody else there did either, and no extra \nhelp was on the way.\n  The same phenomenon plays out with energy projects. Other nations\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nseamlessly integrate their energy resources with their diplomatic and \nnational security efforts. There is no separation between the \nMiddle East's oil and their foreign politics. The same for Russia or \nIran or Venezuela. But U.S. energy executives are not representing the \nU.S. Government, which means our diplomats are on their own in \nconducting energy policy, which means they have an enormous amount of \ncatching up to do against these other petro powers.\n\n  But for the first time, today, the United States is not the leading \ncountry when it comes to diplomatic posts around the world. That \ndistinction now belongs to--guess who?--China. As our adversaries try \nto undermine democracies and rule of law and use their energy and \ntechnology resources to win allies, we simply don't have the means to \nkeep up, another asymmetric advantage for our competitors.\n  We have no dedicated anticorruption or technology or energy policy \ncorps within our foreign service. It is not because we don't need this \ncapacity; it is just because we can't afford it. We lament this \nasymmetric advantage that other countries have on nondefense \ncapabilities, but it is just a choice. It is a choice because we pass, \nyear after year, these massive defense bills, and then we choose not to \nincrease the capabilities that would actually protect us: the \ninvestments in nonmilitary capabilities.\n  Listen, I get it. I know this bill is going to pass, but why on Earth \naren't we spending more time asking the tough questions about whether \nthe balance of our spending on national security is right-sized to the \nactual threats the United States and our democratic allies face?\n  Yes, the Ukraine war is worth fighting, and it is expensive, but does \nit really make sense to spend 847 times more money on conventional \nmilitary tools than we spend on winning the information war? Does it \nreally make sense to add 10 percent to the defense budget while doing \nnothing to increase the size of our international development bank?\n  Do we really think that we are adequately responding to the actual \narray of threats posed to this country with a spending allocation that \nends up with America having 11,000 diplomats, total, and 12,000 \nemployees of military grocery stores?\n  American foreign policy today suffers from a crippling lack of \nimagination. American leaders complain about these asymmetric threats \nbut refuse to acknowledge that this asymmetry exists only because we \nchoose to do this: pass an $847 billion defense budget with a 10 \npercent, 1-year increase and do nothing, at the same time, to build the \nreal capacities necessary to keep up with our adversaries' investments \nin nonmilitary tools of influence.\n  We could decide--this Congress could decide--to build a massive, \nmodern international development bank. We could decide--this Congress \ncould decide--not to let RT dominate the international information \nspace. We could decide--all of us, this Congress--to have enough \ndiplomats around the world to be able to fight the fights that matter \nto us.\n  We should imagine this world in which we fight toe to toe with the \nChinese and the Russians and other adversaries in the development, \ninformation, technology, energy, and diplomatic spheres. We should \nimagine that world and then put in place a plan to achieve it.\n  Asymmetry is a choice. It is a choice for our adversaries, and it is \na choice for us. And it is a consequence of our entire budget--for \ndevelopment aid, anti-propaganda efforts, democracy promotion, human \nrights advancement, humanitarian assistance, and diplomacy--being about \nthe same size as the 1-year increase in the defense budget.\n  And $847 billion is a lot of money to spend without a real debate on \nthe Senate floor, without the ability to offer amendments. I think this \ncountry would be better off, I think our security would be better \nprotected, if we just took a step back, asked some hard questions about \nhow we allocate money within our national security budget, and took the \ntime to have a real floor debate with real input about it all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warnock). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum Computing \n     Cybersecurity Preparedness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cryptography is essential for the national security of \n     the United States and the functioning of the economy of the \n     United States.\n       (2) The most widespread encryption protocols today rely on \n     computational limits of classical computers to provide \n     cybersecurity.\n       (3) Quantum computers might one day have the ability to \n     push computational boundaries, allowing us to solve problems \n     that have been intractable thus far, such as integer \n     factorization, which is important for encryption.\n       (4) The rapid progress of quantum computing suggests the \n     potential for adversaries of the United States to steal \n     sensitive encrypted data today using classical computers, and \n     wait until sufficiently powerful quantum systems are \n     available to decrypt it.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a strategy for the migration of information technology \n     of the Federal Government to post-quantum cryptography is \n     needed; and\n       (2) the governmentwide and industrywide approach to post-\n     quantum cryptography should prioritize developing \n     applications, hardware intellectual property, and software \n     that can be easily updated to support cryptographic agility.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 4081.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4081, the Informing \nConsumers About Smart Devices Act.\n  For consumers, the benefits of technological progress are all around \nus. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in our homes. The \ngrowing array of smart devices and household appliances with voice, \nvideo, and internet connectivity and technology make our lives easier, \nmore entertaining, and more comfortable.\n  So, while there is no question that smart refrigerators, home \nassistants like Amazon's Alexa, and the countless other internet-\nconnected devices that have microphones or cameras benefit consumers, \nthere is also no question that these devices should not be able to \nlisten to or watch us without our knowledge or consent. Unfortunately, \nstudies confirm that many devices do not disclose these capabilities. \nSome are easily tricked into recording when people do not want them to \ndo so.\n  So H.R. 4081 addresses this straightforward problem with a \nstraightforward solution. The bill requires manufacturers of internet-\nconnected devices that are equipped with a camera or microphone to \ndisclose to consumers that a camera or microphone is part of the \ndevice. The bill does not apply to mobile phones, laptops, or other \ndevices that a consumer would already reasonably expect to include a \ncamera or microphone.\n  Now, the Federal Trade Commission must issue guidance to help \nbusinesses comply with these new requirements and may seek penalties, \nincluding civil penalties, for violations.\n  This bill will protect consumers; and I commend Representatives \nCurtis and Moulton for their bipartisan work on this legislation.\n  This bill is commonsense, balanced, and bipartisan. It is a solution \nto an issue that touches all Americans. It unanimously passed out of \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee in July by a vote of 53-to-0 and is \nyet another example of the work the committee is doing to protect \nconsumers. I hope that trend continues today here on the House floor \nbecause there is no reason why consumers should ever be spied on by \ntheir own household devices without their knowledge and consent.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important \nconsumer protection legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4081, the Informing \nConsumers About Smart Devices Act, introduced by Representative Curtis.\n  In the past few years, we have seen a tremendous advancement in the \ndevelopment of technologies in consumer products. While many of these \ntechnologies make everyday life more convenient, they also have the \nability to collect data from their users without their knowledge.\n  While it may be apparent to users that a laptop has the ability to \nrecord conversations, it certainly may not be clear that other devices \nlike televisions, refrigerators, even toasters, have the same \ncapabilities.\n  This bipartisan legislation would simply require manufacturers of the \ninternet-connected devices that contain a microphone or a camera, and \nthat do not market themselves as such consumer electronics, to disclose \nto consumers that such a component is part of the device, either pre- \nor post-sale.\n  We owe it to our constituents to ensure these types of devices are \nnot recording them without their consent and collecting data when their \nusers are not aware.\n  I thank Representatives Curtis and Moulton for their bipartisan work \non H.R. 4018.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to take this opportunity to talk about one of our key staff \npeople who is leaving in the next few days. The person, of course, is \nJerry Leverich, who is right behind me here.\n  Jerry has played an instrumental role in the committee's work, not \nonly with consumer protection but on so many issues. Shortly after I \nbecame the top Democrat on the committee, more than 7 years ago, he \nstarted. He is currently the staff director for both our Subcommittee \non Communications and Technology and our Subcommittee on Consumer \nProtection and Commerce.\n  Over these last 7 years since he has been here, he has played a \ncritical role in our efforts to expand access to broadband nationwide, \nmake internet service more affordable, and protect consumers from \nannoying robocalls.\n  I have to also say that if it wasn't for him, I don't know that I \nwould be able to deal with a lot of technological issues in the \ncommittee or even explain a lot of what we are doing on the issues.\n  He led our efforts this summer, on the Democratic side, on passing \nout of committee for the first time the bicameral and bipartisan \nconsumer data privacy bill, which we consider on both sides of the \naisle a significant achievement. We are still working, obviously, to \nbring that to the House floor before the end of this session of \nCongress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his counsel. I wish him nothing but the \nbest in his future endeavors. Obviously, we don't want him to leave. I \nalso want to say that not only is Jerry such an expert and so \nintelligent and wise on so many issues, but he is also a great \nindividual and someone you can always rely on to be straightforward and \ntell us when we are doing good things, tell us when we are not, telling \nus when we can do things that are achievable and when they are not. \nGenerally, overall, he has been a great staff member, so I thank him.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all support this legislation, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We wish Jerry Godspeed and thank him for the good work. I know \nsometimes when our staff leaves, it is bittersweet. We hate to see them \ngo but know they are going to different opportunities. The hard work \nthat both your side and our side of the aisle do together, sometimes \nwhen we are working on things together, sometimes negotiating together, \nit is always good work. We are well served. The American people, more \nthan anything, are well served by the people who work here on Capitol \nHill. I thank and congratulate Jerry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4081, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n[[Page H8155]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-10-01"}

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4275, the Ensuring \nPhone and Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity \nProgram Act of 2022.\n  Congress has long recognized the critical importance of ensuring that \neveryone in this country can access basic communication tools. Indeed, \nthis body wisely included as a cornerstone of the Communications Act \nthe directive that rapid, efficient, and nationwide communications \nservice must be available to ``all people of the United States, without \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, \nor sex.'' The Communications Act also said that all Americans must have \naccess to adequate facilities and reasonable charges.\n  There are two programs, the Lifeline and the Affordable Connectivity \nProgram, that play a critical role in helping us advance these long-\nheld, universal service goals. They move us closer to closing the \ndigital divide by allowing millions of American families across the \ncountry to fit high-speed broadband internet access into their budgets.\n  Both programs are effectively targeted to families that need the help \nmost, including those who are eligible for Medicaid, the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Bureau of \nIndian Affairs General Assistance, and the Veterans and Survivors \nPension benefit.\n  As we all know too well, a broadband connection is necessary to \nparticipate in our modern economy and society. Families without \nbroadband are left without equal educational, career, healthcare, and \neconomic opportunities compared to those with this essential service.\n  Continuing to strengthen these programs and make them more efficient \nand accessible not only benefits those who sign up but all Americans. \nThat is why I support this bipartisan bill introduced by \nRepresentatives Luria and Katko. It provides us with more transparency \ninto these programs and can help us better identify opportunities to \nmaximize their support.\n  I commend Ranking Member Rodgers and Representative Latta for working \nwith me to advance this legislation on a bipartisan basis. It advanced \nout of the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in July by a vote \nof 48-0.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to likewise support this \nbill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4275, the Ensuring Phone \nand Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity \nProgram Act, which was unanimously reported out of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  The FCC currently administers two subsidy programs to help low-income \nAmericans get connected, the Lifeline program and the Affordable \nConnectivity Program. The FCC uses criteria such as household income or \nparticipation in other Federal subsidy programs to determine \neligibility.\n  The FCC's inspector general identifies fraud and risk in certain \nqualifying programs, highlighting the importance of congressional \noversight.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  H.R. 4275 will help provide Congress with important information \nregarding how low-income Americans qualify for these programs as we \ncontinue our oversight duties.\n  Specifically, this bill will require the FCC to report to Congress on \nwhich eligibility criteria Americans use to qualify for the lifeline of \naffordable connectivity programs. In carrying out this report, the FCC \nwill be limited to using existing data they currently can access to \nverify eligibility. It also requires the FCC to report on the outreach \nand publicity efforts to promote enrollment in these programs.\n  This legislation is an important first step toward oversight of the \nFCC and its administration of these programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PALLONE.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today once \nagain to talk about what is happening in Ukraine. This is the 10th time \nin the 10 weeks of session since before the invasion started that I \nhave come to the floor to talk about the atrocities being committed in \nUkraine by this brutal and unprovoked invasion from Russia and to talk \nabout more effective ways for us to help the Ukrainian people.\n  I just spoke to the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana \nMarkarova. She started by thanking me on behalf of the Ukrainian \npeople--really, thanking the American people--and saying that they \nappreciate all of the help, not just the funding and the weapons but \nthe moral support that the people of Ukraine feel from the people of \nthe United States of America. That made me proud.\n  She also talked about the desperate need right now to provide \nUkrainian soldiers with the heavy weapons they need to confront the new \nfight in Ukraine--the need to confront Russia as Vladimir Putin \ncontinues his brutal campaign to kill Ukrainian citizens, to flatten \nUkrainian cities.\n  Just today, Lviv, which is way over here in western Ukraine, was \nattacked again. So Russia says they are going to focus over here. Once \nagain, they are lobbing missiles into Lviv. Once again, they have \nattacked Odesa in the south, hoping, I suppose, to flatten Odesa as \nwell as they have done with Mariupol and kill there somewhere between \n20 and 25,000 innocent civilians, according to the latest reports we \nhave.\n  Ukraine has been an independent and sovereign country since 1991. \nThey are not part of Russia. In 2014, the people of Ukraine made a very \nconscious choice to turn to the West, to get out from under the Russian \nthumb altogether. They wanted freedom and democracy, to move away from \ntyranny and corruption. They wanted to be like us here in America. That \nis one reason so much of the free world has rallied around Ukraine--\nbecause this is about a country that is seeking freedom, free \nenterprise, the ability to gather freely, free speech.\n  I was an election observer here in 2014 right after they made this \ndecision, and we saw a fair election, where a President was elected by \nthe people with huge voter turnout. Again, that is one reason we feel \nthis connection to Ukraine, as does the rest of the free world.\n  Ukraine's armed forces continue to perform well, but as this map \nshows, the fight is fierce right now. The dark red here is Ukrainian \nterritory that was taken by Russia back in 2014. This includes Crimea. \nIt includes Donetsk, Luhansk. The lighter red is the Ukrainian \nterritory that Russia has seized during this latest invasion during \nthis war. And the light-blue area is where Ukrainian troops have \neffectively countered the Russian offensives and pushed Russian forces \nout of territory.\n  Ukraine won a decisive battle here, as an example, in Kyiv. You can \nsee where they pushed the Russian forces out.\n  The Kremlin, at that time, had as a strategic objective, seizing \nKyiv, which is the capital of Ukraine, and also other major cities all \naround the country. They wanted to force the government--the \ndemocratically elected government--out to overthrow the government of \nPresident Zelenskyy.\n  Instead, because of effective Ukrainian resistance, Russia has been \nforced to settle for these more limited objectives, even as they \ncontinue to bomb cities all around Ukraine.\n  They now want to consolidate the Donbas region and create a land \nbridge from Crimea up to Transnistria. They want to cut off one of the \nworld's greatest exporters--Ukraine--from any access to the city, to \nmake them landlocked so they cannot have an effective economy.\n  Our goal must be to stop Russia from achieving its invasion goals and \npush them out of the territory of this free and independent country, \nUkraine, our ally. This is a very dangerous point in this battle.\n  While the Russians have made incremental gains in the east, they have \nnot achieved the decisive breakthrough that they want, thanks to the \ntoughness and tenacity of the Ukrainian forces. But it is a tough \nfight, and the Ukrainians are outgunned. We must do all we can to keep \nRussia from a breakthrough until heavier weapons pledged by the United \nStates and other allied nations can reinforce Ukrainian positions--our \nhowitzers, as an example. Artillery is starting to arrive but only \nstarting.\n  My hope is that by reinforcing Ukrainian positions with these heavier \nweapons, that will allow Ukraine not just to defend itself but to be \nable to roll back this Russian invasion and reclaim this territory.\n  Late last week, I was pleased that the Biden administration formerly \nrequested emergency supplemental funding that will provide needed \nmilitary, humanitarian, and economic aid for Ukraine. This proposal, by \nthe way, includes $6 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance \nInitiative--a bipartisan initiative I have long spearheaded. Funding \nfor this initiative is used to train, equip, and provide support for \nthe Ukrainian Government and military. It was crucial to helping \nUkraine prepare for the current fight, and it is crucial now.\n\n  As the President has requested, there is also drawdown authority in \nthis legislation. Now, that is what the President is currently using to \nprovide the howitzers I talked about and other military assistance. \nThere is $5 billion of additional Presidential drawdown authority in \nthis request.\n  The existing Presidential drawdown authority has been expended. I \njust checked with the Ambassador again just before making this speech. \nShe indicates that out of the $3.3 billion that was in the previous \nPresidential drawdown authority to provide weapons to Ukraine, there is \nroughly $150 million left. In other words, they need this supplemental \nspending package now. It cannot wait, not at this crucial time in the \nbattle.\n  I am encouraged by the administration's request for military \nassistance because I think--assuming we approve it and get this done \nquickly--it will send a very important message to the world and, most \nimportantly, to Vladimir Putin, that America is in this fight for the \nlong haul.\n  The humanitarian aid is also desperately needed to complement the \nremarkable work that is being done in Ukraine by so many great \nreligious and nonprofit groups. Some of you know Samaritan's Purse, as \nan example.\n  Last night, Jose Andres, who is the founder of what is called the \nWorld Central Kitchen, told me that they have now provided 18 million \nmeals to Ukrainian refugees both in-country and out of country, and \nthey have 12,000 volunteers that have been engaged to do this. They are \nnot asking for money from American taxpayers, but they are providing \nincredible help, so many of these great groups.\n  I am also encouraged that the administration heeded our bipartisan \ncalls and appointed a Ukraine military assistance coordinator, LTG \nTerry Wolff. This followed a letter that I sent with Senators Shaheen, \nWicker, and Durbin, with the goal of cutting through the redtape to \nensure the right weapons get to Ukraine and they get there quickly.\n  When I asked Secretary Blinken last week who Lieutenant General Wolff \nwould be reporting to as the coordinator of the military assistance in \norder to make this whole process work more smoothly and help the \nUkrainians more, he was uncertain.\n  I will state today that I hope that the coordinator, Lieutenant \nGeneral Wolff, will be reporting directly to the Commander in Chief. \nWhy? Because there are so many Agencies and Departments involved, and \nthe whole idea is to have one person who has the President's ear who is \nable to get stuff done quickly, without the bureaucracy. And I know \nPresident Biden believes that we ought to get this military equipment \nand other assistance to Ukraine immediately.\n  In the context of this significant additional funding request for \nUkraine to be able to defend itself, it is important to note that they \nare not just relying on us. We are not the only country providing \nmilitary assistance to Ukraine.\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\n  In the past few weeks, we have seen allies and nations in Europe and \naround the world come together and increase their military aid, and I \ncommend them for that.\n  Last Thursday, after weeks of debate, I was very pleased to see that \nthe German Bundestag, which is their Parliament, voted overwhelmingly \nin favor--586 to 100--of sending heavy weapons to Ukraine. This is a \nbreakthrough for Germany. They have now woken up to the serious threat \nthat Russia poses to European security, and the Germans are now \nassuming more responsibility for defense of their own backyard. Good \nfor them. We need them.\n  Additionally, the Polish Government has now transferred even more \nSoviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine--again, heavy equipment they need in \nthe Donbas.\n  Slovakia has sent S-300 air defense systems. Our great allies in the \nUnited Kingdom have been tremendous supporters of Ukraine since before \nthe invasion, including sending anti-tank and anti-air weapons that \nhave been used to devastating effect on the battlefield. They have sent \nhumanitarian aid and have recently sent Saxon armored vehicles.\n  The Netherlands have also been very helpful by sending Stinger anti-\nair missiles that help Ukraine contest the sky against Russian superior \nair power.\n  Turkey has provided armed drones that have proven deadly effective at \nneutralizing Russian tanks, vehicles, and surface ships. I commend \nTurkey for that.\n  Even on the other side of the globe, democracies are stepping up and \nproviding military aid to Ukraine, including Bushmaster armored \nvehicles from Australia, bulletproof vests from Japan, and other \nmilitary equipment from South Korea.\n  The list of those countries that are providing lethal assistance or \nhumanitarian aid is now over 40 and grows every day as freedom-loving \nnations everywhere see what is happening here. They see President \nPutin's actions for what they are--an assault on freedom and democracy, \na brutal assault.\n  Again, the next few weeks could be a tipping point. But Ukraine is \nfinally starting to get the necessary weaponry from the free world to \nhave a chance to actually succeed in pushing Russia out of their \nterritory.\n\n  The new Ukraine funding bill is being scrubbed right now for issues \nor problems, which is appropriate. We want to be sure, as an example, \nthat the direct economic support has the anti-corruption guardrails we \nhave had in it in the past. The Department of Agriculture funding has \nto be scrubbed to ensure it actually helps Ukraine. But the scrubbing \nhas been going on for almost a week now. It is time for us to move this \nlegislation.\n  I encourage the Senate Democratic leadership to bring to the floor \nthis Ukraine funding bill this week, not combined with other measures \nbut as a stand-alone piece of legislation not tied to COVID funding or \nother unrelated priorities, including title 42 and the border, which I \nfeel strongly about, or other issues, including issues to do with \nAfghanistan and the parolees.\n  Let's keep other issues off of this legislation. Why? Because \notherwise it becomes a political football and will be impossible to \npass quickly.\n  We have time to deal with those other issues as well, and we should. \nBut our allies in Ukraine are desperate for assistance, and they need \nit now at this crucial time in this battle. Adding other politically \ncharged issues to this request will slow it down and delay the lethal \naid, and in the end will cost the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and \ncivilians at the hands of the ruthless Russian attacks.\n  On the sanctions front, I am pleased that this past week, the \nadministration is finally saying they will move forward in seizing, not \njust freezing, Russian assets in the United States.\n  Last Thursday, the administration announced a streamline process for \nseizing assets and finding a legal way to repurpose those assets to \nhelp the Ukrainian people. Good for them. I have called for this in \nlegislation I introduced 5 weeks ago with Senator Bennet of Colorado. \nOur RELIEF Act would ensure seized Russian funds go to support the \nhumanitarian needs in Ukraine, which is just and appropriate. And, by \nthe way, other countries have already done this.\n  The Russians continue to commit war crimes and atrocities against the \ninnocent people of Ukraine. Late last week, Ukrainian authorities filed \ncriminal charges against 10 individual Russian soldiers accused of \ntaking civilians hostage and torturing them in the Kyiv suburb of \nBucha. Many of you have seen the videos. This is the first such move by \nprosecutors investigating possible war crimes by Russians.\n  All 10 were noncommissioned officers and privates from Russia's 64th \nSeparate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, one of the units that took part in \nthe monthlong occupation of Bucha.\n  I call on the International Criminal Court that has announced an \ninvestigation to follow in Ukraine's footsteps and immediately begin an \nactual war crimes tribunal. The evidence of war crimes is clear, and \nthere should be no delay. By holding Russians accountable now, the hope \nis there will be some deterrent effect to avoid additional war crimes \nbeing created.\n  Last week, Secretary Blinken, in his testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee on the new budget request, talked about the \nrequest for additional funding of $5 million for what is called the \nGlobal Engagement Center. This is an organization that Senator Murphy \nof Connecticut and I cofounded with legislation to combat \ndisinformation abroad. Unfortunately, this very modest increase will \nnot adequately address the massive disinformation efforts by the \nKremlin, let alone the world.\n  In this hybrid war in Ukraine, it is not just about kinetic military \naction; it is also about a massive disinformation campaign. They are \nbombarding Ukraine with disinformation that must be confronted.\n\n  The Global Engagement Center is established to do just that. \nUnfortunately, it has been 2 years since there was a coordinator \nappointed by a President to lead this Global Engagement Center. This \ngap in leadership is unacceptable, and I urge the President to \nimmediately appoint a person to this role.\n  The efforts we talked about tonight so far--the heavy weapons, the \nsecurity assistance, the prosecution of war crimes, and the seizing \nrather than freezing of Russian assets--are all steps in the right \ndirection. However, further steps have to be taken if we are going to \nstop the Kremlin from being able to finance this war effort.\n  The biggest problem, by far, is energy. Energy is Russia's No. 1 \nexport. Forty to 50 percent of the Russian budget is funded by energy \nreceipts coming back into the country. President Putin, of course, has \nlong used natural gas as an energy weapon against Europe. Last week, he \ndirected the gas company Gazprom to stop providing natural gas to \nPoland and to Bulgaria. The natural gas supply from Russia was \nsuspended because of Poland and Bulgaria's refusal to pay in rubles, \nRussia's currency, which would help bolster Russia's economy and make \nit easier for them to finance this war. Bulgaria and Poland should be \ncommended for not bowing to Vladimir Putin's wishes.\n  This is also a significant opportunity for the United States to step \nup further and to help our European allies to wean themselves off of \nRussian energy. The United States of America has the tools and the \nresources to help our allies accomplish this. We have a tentative \nagreement to do so. The United States has already halted the import of \nRussian energy. I now commend Lithuania and Estonia for recently doing \nthe exact same thing. Poland has indicated they would like to do the \nsame.\n  In order to encourage Europe to end its dependency on Russian oil and \ngas, America must act now to help ensure there is a more abundant \nsupply of energy resources on the global market for purchase by Europe \nand other countries. Specifically, we need to expand U.S. production of \nnatural gas that will help stabilize the market, provide liquefied \nnatural gas to Europe, and reduce energy costs for consumers. Most \nimportantly, it will stop the flow of funding to Russia's war machine \nthat is killing innocent Ukrainians every single day.\n  Together, working with Europe, we can end the approximately $870 \nmillion a day--$870 million a day--that Europe is sending to Russia to \nhelp fund the\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nwar machine. We must do so immediately by expanding natural gas \nproduction here and our infrastructure here to provide Europe with the \npromised liquefied natural gas as an alternative to Russian gas.\n  But, more generally, we have to support all our domestic producers \nhere in the United States through a robust, all-of-the-above energy \npolicy that includes fossil fuels, renewables, carbon-capture \ntechnologies, nuclear power, hydropower, hydrogen, and energy \nefficiency.\n  Instead of recognizing that Putin is using energy as a weapon and \nresponding appropriately, unfortunately, the Biden administration has \nacted to make it more difficult for domestic energy production. These \nactions include an increase of taxes on energy production proposed in \nthe President's budget, restricting new leases on Federal lands and \nwaters for oil and gas production, rewriting the definitions of the \n``Waters of the United States''--or WOTUS, as it is called--which could \nadd significant time and complexity to permitting new energy projects.\n  As I raised directly with Secretary Blinken last week during his time \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, these domestic policies \nthat the administration is pursuing are having a direct and negative \nimpact on our national security and the security of our allies abroad. \nWe need to produce more right now to be able to ensure our national \nsecurity and their national security is protected.\n  The ruble, the Russian currency, has just about fully recovered from \nits preinvasion value, in part because Russia is still bringing in \nrevenues from the sale of energy. Our sanctions have left Russia's \nbiggest economic lifeline largely untouched: again, energy sales, \nspecifically to Europe.\n  In addition to cutting off natural gas and the revenue that fuels the \nRussian war machine, we need to tighten up bank sanctions as they \nrelate to energy. Sanctions for energy transactions don't go into \neffect against Russian banks, including the VTB Bank, until June 24. \nThese sanctions should have gone in place weeks ago, and they should \ncertainly go into place now.\n  President Biden must lead our allies to do whatever it takes to help \nUkraine win, and the administration should make clear that their \nobjective is for Ukraine to push the forces of Russia out of the \nsovereign territory of Ukraine. Remember, Ukrainians are not asking for \nus to fight for them, but they are asking us to help them fight for \nthemselves. We have got to do that so they have a chance to win.\n\n  Last month, I was at the border of Ukraine and Poland, and I was able \nto talk to a number of Ukrainian refugees. Through their tears, they \nspoke of their homes being destroyed, their loved ones killed, and the \npain of being separated from their husbands and fathers who had stayed \nbehind to fight. Almost every refugee was either a woman or a child, \ngrandparents with their grandchildren.\n  I also saw the heroic efforts and the amazing generosity of spirit \nfrom the Polish people who were taking these Ukrainian refugees \nliterally into their homes--to feed them, to give them a roof over \ntheir head.\n  Yesterday, I joined my colleagues Chris Coons and Roy Blunt \nintroducing a resolution to commend and recognize Poland's efforts in \nwelcoming Ukrainian refugees and supporting the Ukrainian resistance. \nPoland has been amazing. Since Russia's invasion began, more than 3 \nmillion Ukrainians have fled across the border into Poland. We are so \ngrateful to them for opening their hearts and their homes and for \ncontinuing to donate their time and resources to help the refugees.\n  I want to close my remarks today with talking about why the United \nStates has a special obligation to support Ukraine in light of Russia's \nbrutal and illegal invasion. It is important that we not forget the \nBudapest Memorandum signed by Russia, the United States, the United \nKingdom, and Ukraine in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, under \nthis 1994 memorandum, a newly independent Ukraine agreed to give up its \nnuclear weapons, but they did so in return for an ironclad commitment \nfrom all those signatories--the United States, the UK, and Russia--to \nrespect and ensure Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence.\n  This is what makes Russia's invasion and veiled threats of nuclear \nweapons particularly outrageous. Russia made a commitment to respect \nUkraine's territorial integrity and independence in exchange for \nUkraine giving up its nuclear weapons. Now Russia invaded Ukraine and \nis threatening to use nuclear weapons against Ukrainians.\n  This war is in gross violation of the Budapest Memorandum and, of \ncourse, Russia's other international commitments, such as the United \nNations Charter. For these transgressions, it is now time for the \ninternational community to strip Russia of its privilege of sitting on \nthe U.N. Security Council and other bodies of international \nrepresentation, and Russia should be deemed a state sponsor of terror.\n  There is reporting that Russia believed the invasion would split and \nweaken the NATO alliance. Instead, as we have seen, Russia's brutal \nattacks on a neighboring democracy have actually galvanized and \nstrengthened the resolve of NATO and the free world in general and will \nlikely lead to expansion with Finland and Sweden soon joining the NATO \nalliance.\n  What the United States is doing to help Ukraine with military, \nhumanitarian, and economic assistance and rallying our allies to do the \nsame is critically important, particularly at this time, for the battle \nis at a critical stage. It is critically important--it is important not \njust because it fulfills our commitment under the 1994 Budapest \nMemorandum but because it is in our national interest as the leader of \nthe free world to stand with our allies.\n  There was a speech once written that was never given. It was meant to \nbe delivered by President John F. Kennedy on the afternoon of November \n22, 1963, the day that he was killed. The speech was profound and very \nsimple. It said: We, in this country, in this generation, by destiny \nrather than choice, are the watchmen on the walls of world freedom--by \ndestiny rather than choice.\n  When democracies are under attack by authoritarian regimes, history \nsays when America leads, others will join, and we are victorious in \nprotecting freedom.\n  In this instance, in this critical point in Ukraine, we must continue \nto lead the free world in standing with Ukraine until their final \nvictory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-09"}

Reg. 43583; relating to clean \n     cars and trucks), which requires at least 50 percent of new \n     sales of passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the United \n     States to be zero-emission vehicles by 2030;\n       Whereas, by early January 2022--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency had proposed a \n     denial of all pending exemptions to small refineries for \n     compliance years 2019 through 2021 and the reversal of the \n     decision to grant exemptions for the 2018 compliance year, \n     meaning that small refineries, which are normally exempt from \n     annual renewable fuel standard (RFS) obligations, will owe 5 \n     years' worth of RFS compliance costs in a single calendar \n     year;\n       (2) President Biden signed Executive Order 14057 (86 Fed. \n     Reg. 70935; relating to clean energy industries and jobs), \n     which called for the Federal Government to achieve a carbon-\n     free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions \n     economy-wide by 2050; and\n       (3) the average price of gas was $3.28 per gallon; and\n       Whereas, 2 days before the Russian Federation invaded \n     Ukraine and nearly a week before President Biden banned oil \n     and energy imports from the Russian Federation, the average \n     price of gas was $3.61 per gallon: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that President \n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr., has implemented policies impeding \n     domestic energy production and gas prices have steadily \n     increased throughout his presidency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-03-24"}

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to \nthe resolution (H. Res. 336) calling on the Government of the Russian \nFederation to provide evidence or to release United States citizen Paul \nWhelan, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 336\n\n       Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan is a resident of \n     Novi, Michigan, and a United States Marine Corps veteran;\n       Whereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow for the wedding of a \n     personal friend on December 22, 2018;\n       Whereas Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Paul \n     Whelan at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow on December 28, 2018, \n     and charged him with espionage;\n       Whereas the Federal Security Service has never provided any \n     evidence of supposed wrongdoing;\n       Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison and \n     was held there for more than 19 months after his arrest in \n     pretrial detention;\n       Whereas a Moscow court extended Paul Whelan's pretrial \n     detention multiple times without publicly presenting \n     justification or evidence of wrongdoing;\n       Whereas even Paul Whelan's Federal Security Service-\n     appointed lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019, \n     ``[The Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out what they \n     have, but in this case, we've seen nothing concrete against \n     Whelan in five months. That means there is nothing.'';\n       Whereas the then United States Ambassador to the Russian \n     Federation, Jon Huntsman, responded on April 12, 2019, to a \n     question about the detention of Paul Whelan, ``If the \n     Russians have evidence, they should bring it forward. We have \n     seen nothing. If there was a case, I think the evidence would \n     have been brought forward by now.'';\n       Whereas then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with \n     Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and \n     urged him to ensure United States citizens are not unjustly \n     held abroad;\n       Whereas the Kremlin has refused Paul Whelan full access to \n     his lawyer and the so-called evidence against him;\n       Whereas any evidence he has seen is in Russian, a language \n     Paul does not read or speak;\n       Whereas Lefortovo pretrial detention facility and the \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to provide medical \n     treatment for Paul Whelan's medical condition, despite being \n     aware of its worsening state, resulting in emergency surgery \n     on May 29, 2020;\n       Whereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully convicted on June 15, \n     2020, and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor camp by a \n     3-judge panel, in a trial witnessed by then United States \n     Ambassador John Sullivan, who referred to it as ``a mockery \n     of justice'' due to the denial of a fair trial and the \n     exclusion of defense witnesses;\n       Whereas in August 2020, on an unknown day because he was \n     moved secretly, Paul Whelan was transferred to camp IK-17, a \n     penal labor camp in Mordovia, where he is forced to work 6 \n     days a week in a garment factory;\n       Whereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while visiting Paul \n     Whelan at the labor camp in Mordovia, stated that ``Russian \n     authorities . . . have never shown the world evidence of his \n     guilt,'' and reiterated his call that the Russian authorities \n     correct this injustice and release Mr. Whelan; and\n       Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with \n     Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021, \n     and urged him to release Americans detained in Russia, \n     including Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, so that they are able \n     to return home to their families in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) demands the Government of the Russian Federation \n     present credible evidence on the allegations against Paul \n     Whelan or immediately release him from imprisonment;\n       (2) demands the Government of the Russian Federation comply \n     with its international treaty obligations and provide \n     unrestricted consular access to Paul Whelan while he remains \n     imprisoned in Russia;\n       (3) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     provide Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, and all others imprisoned \n     for political motivations or otherwise unjustly imprisoned \n     their constitutionally afforded due process rights and \n     universally recognized human rights; and\n       (4) expresses sympathy to the family of Paul Whelan for \n     this travesty to justice and personal hardship, and expresses \n     hope that their ordeal can soon be brought to a just end.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Phillips) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. \nWilson) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on H. Res. 336, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 336, calling \non the Government of the Russian Federation to provide evidence or to \nrelease United States citizen Paul Whelan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stevens for her tireless work on \nbehalf of her constituent, Paul Whelan, whom Russia has held hostage as \na political prisoner for over 3 years.\n  For more than 1,300 days the Russian Government has put Paul and his \nfamily through unimaginable torment: taking away Paul's freedom, \nthreatening his health, and denying him his most basic human rights--\nall for the purpose of using an American citizen--a human being--as a \npolitical bargaining chip.\n  Paul's treatment at the hands of the Russian Government and its so-\ncalled justice system is shocking, but unfortunately, hardly \nsurprising.\n  As we witness the horrors committed by Putin, his enablers, and \nRussian forces in Ukraine, we are reminded of the lengths that the \nauthoritarian regime in the Kremlin will go to achieve its nefarious \nobjectives. But neither Paul nor any political prisoner is a tool to be \nused for an end. They are human beings with families who just want to \nsee justice served and see their loved ones home safe and sound.\n\n[[Page H4524]]\n\n  In light of the horrific treatment Paul has endured, I thank our \nwonderful diplomats in Russia, particularly Ambassador John Sullivan, \nas well as Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, working \nunder tremendous pressure from the Russian Government to see that Paul \nWhelan, Brittney Griner, and other Americans detained in Russia are \ntreated with dignity and that their human rights are respected.\n  Good news today, we are thrilled that in large part due to their \nwork, Trevor Reed is now on his way home. We cannot stop until Paul's \nfamily and other families with Americans detained overseas are given \nthat same relief. These families work tirelessly to remind us that we \ncannot stop pushing--they deserve that same level of dedication from \nall of us.\n  H. Res. 336, calling on the Government of the Russian Federation to \nprovide evidence or to release United States citizen Paul Whelan, takes \nanother step toward securing that safe and swift release of American \ncitizens from unjust detention abroad.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this important resolution and thank the \ngentlewoman from Michigan for introducing it. I urge all Members to \nvote in support, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be here with Congressman Dean Phillips \nas we work together, unintentionally united by war criminal Putin, as \nDemocrats and Republicans are united for freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, on December 28, 2018, U.S. citizen Paul Whelan was \narrested in Moscow. On June 15, 2020, he was sentenced to 16 years in a \nPutin labor camp. He remains behind bars to this day for a crime he did \nnot commit. No real evidence of Paul's guilt was ever provided, defense \nwitnesses were excluded, and he was denied a fair trial.\n  U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan described Paul's wrongful conviction \nexactly right--a mockery of justice. Paul is an American and a U.S. \nMarine Corps veteran. The U.S. Congress cannot remain silent as Paul \nremains unjustly held by the thug in the Kremlin.\n  The resolution we are considering today shows we have not forgotten--\nand will never forget--Paul or any other American wrongfully detained \nin Russia.\n  I was thrilled and relieved today to learn that Trevor Reed has been \nreleased from his unjust detention in Russia. Trevor, another former \nU.S. Marine, had spent years behind bars on completely fabricated \ncharges.\n  However, we cannot rest until Paul and every single wrongfully \ndetained American is home safely with their families as well.\n  As it launched its full-scale murderous invasion of Ukraine, the \nPutin regime has stepped up its reprehensible practice of targeting \nAmericans for unfounded detentions. In February, Brittney Griner, a \nWNBA--that is the Women's National Basketball Association--player was \narrested for allegedly bringing drugs into Russia. She faces up to 10 \nyears in prison, if convicted. I fear she too will be held hostage by \nthe Russian dictator. I appreciate her Member of Congress, Sheila \nJackson Lee of Houston, for being such an outspoken proponent for her \nrelease.\n  I would be remiss not to mention Vladimir Kara-Murza too. He is one \nof the fiercest advocates of a democratic Russia, who has been poisoned \ntwice by the Putin regime, and who faces up to 15 years in prison for \nspeaking the truth about Putin's unprovoked war of aggression and \nmurder in Ukraine. He is a brave freedom fighter who does not deserve \nto be locked up for shining a light on Putin's brutality and \ncorruption.\n  Putin must stop using innocent Americans as diplomatic pawns and \nrelease them immediately.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution so Paul \nand his family know that the U.S. Congress stands with them, Democrats \nand Republicans, and will do everything in our power to make sure Paul \ncan join Trevor in coming back home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Ms. Stevens).\n  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today--as I have every day I have \nserved in this very Chamber--on behalf of my constituent, Paul Whelan, \nwho has been wrongfully detained in Russia since the end of December, \n2018.\n  Throughout Mr. Whelan's detention, the Russian Government has \nrepeatedly violated his rights, denied him proper medical care, and \nrefused to provide any evidence to substantiate the charges against \nhim. He was held in pretrial detention for over 18 months in the \nnotorious Lefortovo Prison. Then Mr. Whelan's trial was held behind \nclosed doors, and his defense was prohibited from calling witnesses. \nMr. Whelan now serves a 16-year sentence of hard labor, and he is in \nhis fifties. He is currently being held in a prison camp where he has \nbeen since August 2020, facing unbelievably harsh conditions, injury, \nand illness.\n  Early this morning the news broke that fellow American, Trevor Reed, \na marine and Texan who had also been wrongfully imprisoned in Russia, \nwas freed through a prisoner swap orchestrated by President Biden. This \nis incredible news.\n  While this is incredible news for Mr. Reed and his family, let us say \nin this Chamber that Paul and his family deserve to experience the same \njoy and relief. Paul has been imprisoned longer than any other detained \nAmerican in Russia. He has had years stolen from him, including \nprecious time with his aging parents and siblings. One by one, he has \nlost his home in Novi, his job, his ability to communicate with \nfriends, his beloved dog, Flora, and so much more. I want to see my \nconstituent of Novi, Michigan, back home.\n  This innocent man has had his life and his livelihood stolen from him \nby Vladimir Putin. Today, we have the opportunity as a Congress to \ndenounce Paul's wrongful imprisonment and stand up to the lawlessness \nof the Putin regime. In the years since Paul's detention, we have seen \nMr. Putin further isolate himself on the world stage as his government \nhas dissolved into one of true lawlessness leading to threats and \nviolence. We have all borne witness to the tragic loss of life of \nthousands of innocent Ukrainians and watched while a democratic nation \nis being destroyed at the directive of this dangerous war criminal. We \nmust stand up from this Chamber.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined us. I thank Mr. Keating, and I \ncertainly recognize the chairman, Mr. Meeks, and the ranking member, \nMr. McCaul, for their attention to this matter.\n  If Paul is watching this, he will know that I am praying for him, I \nam rooting for him, and I will never stop fighting for him. Let's pass \nH. Res. 336 immediately.\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from South Carolina for the \ntime, and, of course, I thank my friend, Mr. Phillips, for leading the \ndebate on this important issue.\n  Once again, we gather on the House floor in unity--Republicans and \nDemocrats--to counter Putin's behavior.\n  Last year, I cofounded the first Congressional Task Force for \nAmerican Hostages and Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad with my \nfriend, Ted Deutch, from Florida.\n  I thank Representative Stevens for being one of the first members of \nthat task force, and that is why I rise in strong support of my friend \nHaley Stevens' resolution which calls for the release of Paul Whelan \nwho is, in fact, unjustly imprisoned in Russia.\n  We have heard today in the debates some of the details of Paul's \narrest and nearly 2 years in pretrial detention with no evidence \npublicly presented justifying wrongdoing.\n  All parts of our government, especially Members of Congress, who \ndirectly represent the families of those held hostage or wrongfully \ndetained, must engage with friends and enemies alike, to ensure that \nAmericans in situations like Paul Whelan's are expeditiously brought \nhome. Further, Congress must continue to engage with the administration \nin situations like these to disincentivize the wrongful detention or \nhostage taking of Americans.\n\n[[Page H4525]]\n\n  Last year, we passed a similar resolution on this floor in support of \nTrevor Reed and Paul Whelan. It was, in fact, rewarding this morning to \nhear that Trevor was released; but, he should have never been held, and \nthe exchange of prisoners should have never been necessary.\n  But today, Mr. Speaker, on a combined basis, Republicans and \nDemocrats, let us issue a message to Paul Whelan: We have not forgotten \nyou.\n  And let this message be clear that countries that engage in political \nhostage taking must stop the disgraceful practice and be held \naccountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support Representative \nStevens' resolution.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 336 and, once again, \ncall on the Russian Government to release American citizen, Paul \nWhelan. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Haley Stevens, for her \nundying leadership in fighting this travesty--and it is a travesty.\n  It has now been over 3 years since Paul Whelan--a marine veteran, a \nMichigan resident, and, most importantly, an American citizen--was \nimprisoned in Russia without proper evidence or a fair trial. It was a \nsham trial; that is the messaging Paul wanted to convey to the world as \nan unjust Russian judicial system handed out a ridiculous sentence. \nThroughout his detainment, he has also been denied access to proper \nmedical treatment, despite a sharp decline in his health.\n  Just this week, I returned from Ukraine where Russian atrocities have \nbeen on display to the entire world. Make no mistake about that. We saw \nheartbreaking devastation that has impacted so many lives. But \ntragically, Vladimir Putin's barbaric behavior is not new. He has no \nconcern for even the most basic of human rights.\n\n  Today, the House must send an unequivocal message to the Kremlin: It \nis time to end the maltreatment of Paul Whelan.\n  We just learned the good news that Trevor Reed, another American \ndetained in Russia, was released from prison. We are calling for Paul \nto be next.\n  I want to close with a message to Paul's dear parents, Rosemary and \nEd, who live in my district in Manchester, Michigan; and to Paul's \nsiblings, Elizabeth, David, and Andrew. I know this has been an \nincredibly trying time for your family. I admire your resolve in the \nface of adversity. I grieve with you. I pray for you. And I continue to \nstand with you.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Paul Whelan to come home to Michigan.\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Representative Haley Stevens for her \nwork on this resolution. You can tell it is from the heart, and we are \nworking together, again, Republicans and Democrats.\n  How fortunate we are, with the leadership of Congressman Tim Walberg, \nto have spent the Orthodox Christian Easter weekend in Ukraine to visit \nwith Lviv, to be in Kiev, to be in the Bucha region where the \natrocities were so horrific, and to be on a delegation with \nCongresswoman Victoria Spartz, who was actually born in Soviet Ukraine, \nand now she has seen it become a free Ukraine. Our country is so \nblessed by the number of Ukrainians who have come to live in our \ncountry and then support their maintenance, victory, and winning for \nfreedom in Ukraine.\n  As the world watches in horror at the war crimes and atrocities that \nthe war criminal Putin is committing in Ukraine, we must also condemn \nthe Russian dictator's practice of exploiting innocent Americans as \npolitical pawns.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution. This will \nsend a strong message to Paul and the other wrongfully detained \nAmericans in Russia that Congress will not rest until they are returned \nhome to their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for \nthe purpose of closing.\n  I also thank my dear friend and colleague from South Carolina for \ndelivering to me a Ukraine-United States solidarity pin that I now wear \nproudly on my lapel.\n  Freedom is at the core of our American values. It is the backbone of \ndemocracy. We have Americans stuck in Russia and around the world being \nheld against their will and without explanation to be used as political \nbargaining chips.\n  During this time of horrific atrocities, their safe and secure \nrelease is all the more imperative. H. Res. 336 takes action to secure \nthe safety of our fellow Americans, including Brittany Griner and Paul \nWhelan, who are at the mercy of Vladimir Putin, an evil dictator who \nhas no regard for human life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nbill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) that the House suspend the \nrules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 336, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-02"}

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act.\n  As we all know by now, on May 24, 21 children and teachers were \nsenselessly murdered in Uvalde, Texas. Just 10 days earlier, 10 Black \npeople were killed in a racially motivated hate crime.\n  For decades, the epidemic of gun violence has gripped this country, \ndepriving Americans of their neighbors, siblings, children, and \nfriends. On average, over 38,000 people die from gun violence every \nyear in this country, including, on average, over 1,600 children. That \nis roughly an average of five kids every day.\n  Think about that: Five children being murdered, committing suicide, \nor being killed by the unintentional discharge of a weapon every day in \nAmerica.\n  I do not pretend that this bill will save every one of those children \nor stop racially motivated murder in our Nation, but the idea that we \nsimply stand back and do nothing and expect this problem to resolve \nitself is nonsense.\n  It offends the tens of thousands of gun violence victims every year, \ntheir families, and communities that are ravaged by unending tragedy. \nWe can and we must take steps, meaningful steps, to reduce gun \nviolence.\n  This bill will restrict the sale of assault-style weapons to those \nover the age of 21 years old. It will close longstanding and dangerous \nloopholes in Federal law, require that firearms sold in the United \nStates be traceable, and help prevent gun trafficking, among other \nsteps. These are measured, commonsense, and widely supported measures \nthat would help reduce gun violence in our country.\n  As an American, as a Congresswoman, and as a mother of two children, \nI implore the Members of the House and the Senate to pass this bill. I \nam pleading with this Congress to set aside partisanship, dogma, and \nreflexive bickering.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nAlaska (Mrs. Peltola) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. \nFoxx) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alaska.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on S. 1402, the Durbin Feeling Native \nAmerican Languages Act of 2021.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1402, the Durbin \nFeeling Native American Languages Act of 2021.\n  Preserving Native American languages is essential to preserving the \nidentity, traditions, and culture of the Native American community.\n  Regrettably, for decades, the Federal Government created policies \nthat sought to suppress the use of Native American languages.\n  In response, President George H.W. Bush signed the Native American \nLanguage Act into law, which ensures the rights and freedoms of Native \nAmericans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages.\n  The bill before us today, the Durbin Feeling Native American \nLanguages Act of 2021 helps ensure the Federal Government makes good on \nthat promise. Specifically, the bill directs the President to review \nFederal agencies' compliance with the Native American Language Act \nrequirements and make recommendations to improve interagency \ncoordination.\n  It would also authorize a Federal survey of Native American language \nuse and language revitalization programs' unmet needs every 5 years. \nThese surveys will serve as ``health checks'' to improve targeting of \nFederal resources for Native American languages.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in preserving Native \nAmerican languages and pass S. 1402.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1402, the Durbin Feeling \nNative American Languages Act, named after Durbin Feeling, a linguist \nfrom the Cherokee Nation who passed away in 2020. This bill takes \npositive steps to preserve the legacy of Native languages and cultures.\n  In short, this legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to work with other Federal agencies, local, and Tribal \npartners to examine which laws are helping protect Tribal languages and \nwhich aren't.\n  This legislation will bolster efforts to preserve, promote, and \nrevitalize Tribal languages and culture. This legislation also creates \na voluntary survey to assess the use of Native American languages. It \nis important to know if these efforts are effective.\n  This bill also promotes good governance. The President will be \nrequired to report to Congress on whether Federal laws are hindering \nthe preservation of Native American languages. This is an example of \nresponsible legislating, which includes limiting redundancy, holding \nagencies accountable, and ensuring laws are working as intended.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1402, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Madam Speaker, the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act is a \ncommonsense bill that will help preserve the integrity of Native \nlanguages and culture.\n  Directing the Secretary of HHS to work across the Federal Government \nand with Tribal leaders to examine which laws are helping Native \nlanguages thrive is pragmatic. Directing the President to keep us \ninformed on those efforts is also wise.\n  Language is integral to any culture; this sensible legislation will \naid in the important work of keeping Native American languages alive \nand strong.\n  Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, now more than ever, it is critical that we work \ntogether to preserve Native American languages.\n  During the pandemic, Native Americans lost their lives at higher \nrates compared to other demographics in the United States. The loss of \nTribal members inflicted an immeasurable loss to Native Americans' \ntraditions and languages.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to help correct the course. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act of \n2021 and support and preservation of Native American languages.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 1402.\n\n[[Page H9958]]\n\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-12-24"}

A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and \nthe Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the taking, importation, \nexportation, and breeding of certain cetaceans for public display, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of \nlegislation that I introduced today along with Senators Booker, Wyden, \nDuckworth, Padilla, and Warren: the Strengthening Welfare in Marine \nSettings (SWIMS) Act. This is a companion to legislation introduced by \nCongressman Adam Schiff in the House of Representatives.\n  Our bill would ban the importation and exportation of orcas, beluga \nwhales, pilot whales, and false killer whales for public display, with \nan exception for animals being released to a marine sanctuary or back \nto the wild.\n  Our bill would also prohibit breeding captive whales to raise their \nnewborns for public display, ensuring that the current generation of \nthese whales in captivity would be the last.\n  The evidence is clear: Orcas, beluga whales, pilot whales, and false \nkiller whales are intelligent and emotionally complex animals that \ncannot thrive in captivity. In the wild, these whales can travel up to \n100 miles per day and dive hundreds of feet deep.\n  However, many animals in captivity live in tanks so small they cannot \neven turn around. Often, these whales are so stressed that they gnaw on \nthe concrete walls of their tanks until the dental nerves of their \nteeth are exposed, permanently damaging their teeth and requiring \nconstant antibiotics.\n  The inhumane confinement for these animals has consequences, which \nare made clear when news breaks of yet another whale dying well before \nits time. In the wild, the average orca lives for 40 years. Orcas in \ncaptivity in the United States typically live only 12 years. Although \nno orca has ever been documented attacking a human in the wild, in \ncaptivity, these whales have been documented to lash out at their human \ntrainers, causing severe harm or death.\n  Despite these well-established facts, more than 50 whales remain in \ncaptivity across the United States. My home State of California has \nalready banned orca shows and breeding, and some exhibitors like \nSeaWorld have promised to end their orca breeding programs.\n  It is long past time for Federal Government to apply this policy to \nthe whale species that suffer the most in captivity and end this cruel \npractice. Our bill, which is endorsed by 15 animal welfare \norganizations, would do just that.\n  Mr. President, by passing my bill, the Senate can prevent the \nneedless suffering and deaths of these majestic animals who truly \nbelong in the wild. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the \nSWIMS Act.\n                                 ______\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-08-12"}

Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules \nand pass the bill (H.R. 6899) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury \nfrom engaging in transactions involving the exchange of Special Drawing \nRights issued by the International Monetary Fund that are held by the \nRussian Federation or Belarus, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 6899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Russia and Belarus SDR \n     Exchange Prohibition Act of 2022''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS EXCHANGE PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury may not \n     engage in any transaction involving the exchange of Special \n     Drawing Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund that \n     are held by the Russian Federation or Belarus.\n       (b) Advocacy.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (1) vigorously advocate that the governments of the member \n     countries of the International Monetary Fund, to the extent \n     that the member countries issue freely usable currencies, \n     prohibit transactions involving the exchange of Special \n     Drawing Rights held by the Russian Federation or Belarus and\n       (2) direct the United States Executive Director at each \n     international financial institution (as defined in section \n     1701(c)(2) of the International Financial Institutions Act) \n     to use the voice and vote of the United States to oppose the \n     provision of financial assistance to the Russian Federation \n     and Belarus, except to address basic human needs of the \n     civilian population.\n       (c) Termination.--The preceding provisions of this section \n     shall have no force or effect on the earlier of--\n       (1) the date that is 5 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) 30 days after the date that the President reports to \n     the Congress that the governments of the Russian Federation \n     and Belarus have ceased destabilizing activities with respect \n     to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n       (d) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     this section if the President reports to the Congress that \n     the waiver is in the national interest of the United States \n     and includes an explanation of the reasons therefor.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Garcia) and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material \nthereon.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for \nhis leadership on H.R. 6899, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange \nProhibition Act of 2022.\n  Mr. Hill's legislation would codify the Biden administration's \ncurrent position against exchanging any Special Drawing Rights, or \nSDRs, held by Russia or Belarus for U.S. dollars.\n  SDRs are a special reserve asset created by the International \nMonetary Fund to supplement the official reserves of its members. SDR \nallocations are distributed to all IMF member countries in proportion \nto their shareholding in the fund, and countries can hold their SDRs as \npart of their precautionary reserve balances or convert them for hard \ncurrency to finance balance of payments needs, pay for imports, adjust \nthe composition of their reserves, or pay back IMF loans.\n  In August of 2021, the IMF issued a $650 billion general allocation \nof SDRs, of which $275 billion went to emerging market and developing \ncountries to help transform the global pandemic crisis into a fair and \nresilient economic recovery.\n  Given the recent sanctions placed by the G7 group of nations against \nRussia's central bank and other Russian financial institutions, as well \nas the international sanctions against the banking sector in Belarus, \nit would be difficult for Russia or Belarus to find any country willing \nto convert their SDRs, especially since such a transaction would be \nviewed by the rest of the world as a hostile action.\n  Even if the central bank of Russia were able to acquire a key freely \nusable currency, such as U.S. dollars, euros, yen, or pounds, as a \nresult of an SDR transaction, current sanctions would effectively \nimmobilize those assets.\n  I think it is useful for Congress to reinforce the administration's \nposition against the conversion of SDRs held by Russia or Belarus, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation being \nconsidered here on the House floor, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange \nProhibition Act, H.R. 6899.\n  This legislation would prohibit the United States from exchanging any \nSpecial Drawing Rights, or SDRs, with Russia or Belarus. These SDRs are \nreserve assets issued by the International Monetary Fund, the IMF.\n  This bill would also require the Secretary of the Treasury to work \nwith other IMF member countries to prevent them from doing the same.\n  Now, let's be blunt. We should be especially concerned by Russia's \nability to exchange its SDRs for Chinese renminbi or pledge their SDRs \nfor a loan that isn't transparent to the world in support of Russia's \nillegal invasion by a country such as China, using those reserve \nassets.\n\n[[Page H4755]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  This is a particular risk, as Moscow is increasingly forced to \npotentially turn to China in response to global sanctions imposed on \nthe nation of Russia and its central bank. Mr. Speaker, the world is \nwatching, and we must send a message that the United States is not \nstanding idly by and allowing SDR assets to be used to finance the \ndestruction of Ukraine.\n  Russia alone owns over $25 billion of these IMF reserve assets, and \nthese IMF assets represent unconditional liquidity and a source of \nfinancing for the Kremlin. It is important to note that of that $25 \nbillion of SDR assets on the books of the Russian central bank, more \nthan $17 billion of it was just recently gifted to czar Putin last \nyear, through the Biden administration's $650 billion green-lighting of \na general SDR allocation by the IMF.\n  Nearly a billion dollars in SDRs were also awarded to Belarus last \nyear, a move that our colleagues from the bipartisan Friends of Belarus \nCaucus warned would be rewarding state-sponsored violence against \ncivilians.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, on this House floor, in our committee, and in many \nother forums over many months, I urged Treasury Secretary Yellen and \nthe administration not to pursue this flawed policy. There were \nsuperior policy choices with an eye to benefiting the poorest nations \non our globe that have had the hardest macroeconomic impact as a result \nof COVID-19, superior policy choices, far superior to an across-the-\nboard general allocation, because not only do wealthy countries get \nthat allocation and the poor countries get it, but the foes of freedom \nget the allocation. We are back on this House floor today talking about \nthe ramifications of when that happens. Two foes of freedom today, no \ndoubt, are Belarus and Russia.\n  My warnings came long before the invasion of Ukraine began, but those \nwarnings were not heeded. Today, we come to the House floor united as a \nbipartisan leadership team saying under no circumstances should the \ncentral banks of Belarus and Russia in any way, shape, or form have \naccess to their special drawing rights, pledge their special drawing \nrights, or exchange their special drawing rights, and we once again \nurge our Treasury Secretary to put up the guardrails, lay those rules \nof the road out, prohibit anyone who is a member of the IMF from doing \nlikewise. That work with our allies at the IMF is critical to ensure \nthat China or some other nation doesn't throw Vladimir Putin an SDR \nlifeline.\n  Passing this bill, too, sends a clear signal to Beijing that the \nUnited States will not tolerate such a move, and I would argue our \nEuropean Transatlantic partners would not tolerate such a move.\n  This bill also requires the administration to oppose conventional \nloans to Russia or Belarus if they approach the IMF as a lender of last \nresort. This is important, because as we seek to exert maximum pressure \nagainst these regimes, we cannot, as Mr. Sherman talked about a few \nminutes ago, allow loopholes to be exploited for potential assistance \nfrom the IMF.\n  H.R. 6899 presents a clear choice to Russia and Belarus: End the \ndestabilizing activities in Ukraine or find yourself shut off from \nemergency liquidity just like on this floor we have talked about \nshutting off diplomatic efforts at global responsibility.\n  I conclude my comments by thanking Chair Waters and her Democratic \ncolleagues for their support of this bill and her work on this bill and \nher recognition of what a tragedy a backdoor bailout of Russia by \nothers using central bank assets would be.\n  We will continue to find a way to deprive Russia of cash and \nfinancing as it continues to wage war in Ukraine. H.R. 6899 is a strong \nstep in that direction. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  As Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine, this body, on a \nbipartisan basis, will continue to ensure that we are using all the \nlevers to exert and utilize maximum pressure, maximum lethal assistance \npressure to Ukraine, maximum diplomatic pressure through isolating \nRussia in international organizations, and maximum economic pressure \nthat we are talking about on this floor, of which H.R. 6899 is one cog \nin that wheel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank U.S. Senators Rick Scott and Joe \nManchin, who have introduced the companion legislation to H.R. 6899 in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I look forward to this becoming law soon. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  In closing, I thank the bill's author, Representative Hill, for \ngiving the Members of the House the opportunity to act together against \nRussia and Belarus and their war against the free world. I urge Members \non both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 6899.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Trone). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6899, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-22"}

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGreen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, as my friends are assisting me, I\n\n[[Page H8526]]\n\nshall start by thanking the leadership for the opportunity to give this \nmessage today. I believe this is a message that is long overdue. In \nfact, it is hundreds of years overdue.\n  I thank the persons who are assisting me. They have done an \noutstanding job. I thank all of the persons associated with this body \nfor making it possible for me to have this opportunity to speak today \non a matter of vital importance, an issue that is hundreds of years \noverdue, an issue that can make a difference in the life of our \ncountry.\n  I am Al Green, Member of Congress from Texas, and still I rise, Madam \nSpeaker, and still I rise today to call to the attention of the \nCongress that I will be asking for a Congressional Gold Medal for the \nmany persons who toiled and slaved in this country such that our \ncountry is the economic and, quite frankly, the world powerhouse that \nit is when it comes to all of the things that can make a country great \nas it relates to its economic standing.\n  This is the message that I would have my colleagues take note of, the \nmessage that I hope they will give consideration to.\n  The message: Confederate soldiers were awarded a Congressional Gold \nMedal in 1956. When some people hear this, they have what we call a \ndouble take, because it is difficult for them to believe that \nConfederate soldiers were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Some things bear repeating. A Confederate soldier, more than one, \nwere awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1956. What Congress did for \nthe soldier enslavers it should do for the enslaved. I am asking my \ncolleagues to support the historic Congressional Gold Medal for \nAmerica's economic foundational mothers, fathers, and children.\n  I say children because in this country, persons of African ancestry \nearly on were born into slavery, lived in slavery, and died in slavery. \nThis was the status of things in the United States of America at one \npoint and when the country was known as the colonies at another point.\n  The enslaved people made a difference in the lives of those who were \nliving here as persons other than slaves. The deadline for this \ndocument, this monumental piece of legislation, this bill requesting a \nCongressional Gold Medal, will be February 1, 2023. This will be the \nfirst day of Black History Month.\n  Black History Month has been chosen, Madam Speaker, because the \nhistory of Africans in America has not been told. There are many \naspects of it that have been deleted from history. I believe that it is \ntime for us to clear the record.\n  The deadline will be February 1, 2023, the first day of Black History \nMonth. This date was chosen because Black history has not been told. It \nis one of the greatest stories never told, and we are still trying to \ncomplete it. This will be a part of that process, to let people know \nmore about what the enslaved people in this country contributed to the \ncountry.\n  Some people would say to me, and I have had at least one person to \nsay: Do you really believe that Congress will accord a Congressional \nGold Medal to the slaves? And my answer is: Yes, I believe Congress \nwill do it.\n  I believe Congress will do it because I remember what the father of \nJuneteenth suffered in his effort to get Juneteenth as a holiday in \nTexas. I remember how he was called names and castigated. I remember \nhow there were people who felt that Juneteenth was a country holiday, \nthey felt that it was too bucolic, too rustic, for intellectual society \nto embrace. But he fought and he won. The Honorable Al Edwards is now \nthe father of Juneteenth. At the time he introduced it, he was thought \nof as a person who would never succeed in the Texas House of \nRepresentatives, but he served well and he showed and demonstrated to \nus that persistence can make a difference.\n  So we plan to be persistent with this legislation, and we plan to \nmake sure that we continue until we get the legislation passed.\n  The letter that I will send to my colleagues reads--continuing to \nread it--on July 18, 1956, Congress--this would be the House and the \nSenate--awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldier \nenslavers. However, to this day, Congress has never awarded a \nCongressional Gold Medal to the over 10 million enslaved men, women, \nand children.\n  I have to pause. Ten million men, women, and children. Who can \nimagine that a country would have a process by which a person is born \ninto slavery, lives his or her entire life in slavery, and dies in \nslavery. This was the status of things in this country at one time.\n  The country has never awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the over \n10 million enslaved men, women, and children who toiled for over 240 \nyears to build the economy and the infrastructure, the foundation, if \nyou will, of the wealthiest nation to ever exist on the planet Earth.\n  These foundational mothers and fathers of our country labored \narduously, constructing our roads, bridges, wells, and cities. They \nlaboriously planted as well as harvested the food that fed our Nation. \nHow ungrateful can we be to people who made such a sacrifice for this \ncountry, to still to this day see them as less-thans, to this day not \naccord them some degree of honor and dignity for the suffering that \nthey endured for some 200-plus years.\n  They were the de facto producers of the cash crops that fueled our \nNation's foundational wealth. America is the wealthy powerhouse that it \nis today because of Black people, people from Africa, who were \nenslaved, brought to this country, and made to work their entire lives, \nmany of them, so that America could be the economic powerhouse that it \nwas then and has continued to be until this day.\n  These enslaved human beings of African ancestry toiled as slaves \nwithout remuneration or recompense. They have not been given any \nemolument, and to add insult to this injury, they have not been given \nany degree of respect for what they did to make this country great.\n  Their humble hands were relied on for the erection of some of our \nNation's most renowned edifices and monuments, including the White \nHouse, the Capitol Building--this is the Capitol Building, for those \nwho may be unaware--and the Washington Monument. Humble hands, forced \nto do the bidding of those who lived lives of luxury, many of them, \nmade America great, built the Capitol, humble hands, the Washington \nMonument.\n  In truth, their sacrificed lives provided the genesis of our Nation's \neconomic preeminence. These sacrificed human beings--men, women, and \nchildren--were the greatest contributors to the foundational economy \nwhose contributions are almost universally forgotten, underrecognized, \nignored, overlooked, and/or undervalued.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Many of the things that I read to you today I will repeat. They have \nnot been said before. They should be heard multiple times, and some \nthings just bear repeating.\n  So let me repeat. These sacrificed human beings--men, women, and \nchildren, with the emphasis on children--were the greatest contributors \nto the American foundational economy whose contributions are almost \nuniversally forgotten, underrecognized, ignored, overlooked, and \nundervalued.\n  For these and countless other justifications, I am beseeching the \nCongress to award the Congressional Gold Medal collectively to the \nhuman beings who are the foundational fathers, mothers, and children \nwho toiled as slaves without recompense or recognition for their \nunparalleled contributions to the infrastructural and economic \ndevelopment of the Nation that we enjoy today.\n  Awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to groups of individuals is not \nunprecedented, as a Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Confederate \nenslavers. I think this bears some sidebar commentary. Confederate \nenslavers. The people who fought to maintain slavery have been awarded \na Congressional Gold Medal. The people who sought to maintain the \ninstitution that prevented people from having the freedom that they had \nhave received a Congressional Gold Medal.\n  What is wrong with us? What mindset could we have had in 1956 when \nthis House decided that it would accord Congressional Gold Medals to \nConfederate soldiers? I cannot understand how we would ever do this. \nBut then to add additional insult to injury, to never consider the \npeople who helped build the country, the people who made it the \neconomic powerhouse that it was then and is now.\n\n[[Page H8527]]\n\n  What is wrong with us? Is racism such a disease that it infects our \nminds to the extent that we cannot see and concentrate with the degree \nof clarity necessary to make righteous decisions? This was one of the \nsaddest days in this Congress when it voted to give a Congressional \nGold Medal to Confederate soldiers.\n  But there is a way for Congress to redeem itself. Redemption is at \nhand. And here is the means by which you can redeem yourself, Members: \nGive these persons who toiled and slaved, born into slavery, lived and \ndied in slavery, give them the same level of respect that you gave the \npeople who sought to enslave them, that fought to enslave them. Some of \nthem died in their effort to keep them in chains, in bondage, subject \nto the whims of their masters, and their whims were many times things \nthat are unacceptable in decent societies.\n  Awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to groups of individuals is not \nunprecedented, as a Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Confederate \nsoldier enslavers, also to the Tuskegee Airmen--some of them received \ntheir Congressional Gold Medals antemortem, and some others \npostmortem--to the Navajo Code Talkers, and posthumously to the \nservicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.\n  So, friends, the point to be made here is, you can't make the \nargument that we can't do it because it is a group of people. We have \ndone it for other groups. You can't make the argument that we can't do \nit because none of them are alive. We have done it posthumously for \nothers.\n  There is really no argument to make except you don't believe that \npersons who toiled all of their lives--many of them lived, died, born \ninto it--that they deserve respect and recognition. That is what this \nis about, respect and recognition.\n  I am bringing this to your attention so that you can give \nconsideration to it. We won't ask for signatures until the next \nCongress because to ask for them in this Congress with the short period \nof time left would be futile, and I believe that we should wait, and we \nwill wait until February 1 of next year to do it during Black History \nMonth.\n  It is my belief that men, women, and children who suffered a great \ncrime against humanity--and this was a crime against humanity; slavery \nwas a crime against humanity, one of the greatest crimes ever \nperpetrated on humanity--it is my belief that men, women, and children \nwho suffered a great crime against humanity, toiling unremunerated as \nslaves, many for their entire work lives, are more deserving of a \nCongressional Gold Medal than those who soldiered to preserve slavery.\n  To be as clear as I can be, perspicuously so, it is my belief that \nthose who were enslaved have a greater entitlement to a Congressional \nGold Medal than the soldiers who fought to maintain slavery.\n  The zeitgeist of our time, the mood, the spirit, the zeitgeist of our \ntime impels the introduction of this historic legislation. I am going \nto ask if Members wish to be recognized as a courageous historic \noriginal cosponsor, they should contact my office. We will more than \nhonor requests that are made early, but officially we will start in the \nnext Congress. We will have this historic legislation made available on \nour website. In my office, you might contact Aaron, and his email \naddress is readily available for those who would like to contact him, \nor you can simply call our office, and we will be more than pleased to \nspeak to you.\n  I will close by talking about a couple of pictures that I have here. \nIt is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is a \ndepiction of the arrival of these first 20 or so persons in this what \nis now the United States of America. It wasn't then, 1619. If you can \nsee this, you can see a representation of persons who are standing \naround.\n  This is purported to be the White Lion, the ship that brought them \nhere, and these persons standing around, you can see that they have on \nclothing that would protect them from the weather. It appears to be a \nday wherein the weather is not kind, inclement weather. But if you look \nat the persons who are enslaved, shackled, to say that they are \nscantily clad is a gross understatement. It would be an insulting \neuphemism.\n  This picture speaks volumes about what slavery was all about. It was \nabout people who were thought of as less than human. Didn't have to \ntreat them fairly. Didn't have to keep them warm if you chose not \nto. Didn't have to keep them alive. One insult could cost a person his \nor her life. The picture is worth a thousand words. These people, well-\nclothed, looking on, some of them possibly contemplating what they \nwould do with these human beings.\n\n  I plan to go to Norfolk, Virginia, Old Point Comfort, if you will. I \nwant to see this place. It is identifiable. I want to see it. I want to \nsay I was there. I want to say I stood on the soil where human beings \nwere first introduced, by many accounts. There may be some discrepancy, \nbut my most accounts, this is where it happened. I am going to go.\n  Here is another rendition. This one shows a baby. Looks like the baby \nis with a female, possibly the mother, dressed in clothing that I would \nconsider more acceptable for the weather than in the other. There are \nmany renditions, but we still have the White Lion, and we still have \npersons standing around talking about these human beings, contemplating \ntheir fate is my speculation.\n  What kind of person enslaves a baby? What kind of person enslaves a \nbaby? What kind of person would see a child and see labor that can be \nthe benefit of having this human being survive and have this child grow \nup and deny the child an opportunity to get an education? What kind of \nperson denies a baby the opportunity to grow up and just understand the \nworld by virtue of being able to read?\n  There are still places on the planet where young girls are not \nallowed to get the same level of schooling and education as young men. \nI am opposed to that. I am opposed to the people who do that. I have \ngood reason to be opposed. Here is one. I understand what has happened.\n  What kind of person keeps people in ignorance intentionally? The kind \nof person who would want to make sure that this person never has a \nlife, but only an existence. They didn't have a life. They just existed \nto serve their masters.\n  Anybody who believes that this piece of legislation is inappropriate \nis a person that doesn't understand this, and I am being kind by saying \nwhat I just said. There are many other ways; there are many adjectives.\n  When I first examined these photos, I had tears well up in my eyes \nbecause I realized who they were. Not only were they human beings, \nthese were my relatives. These are the people on whose shoulders I \nstand. More than 240 years they suffered. These are the people that \nthis country ought to honor and appreciate, and these are the people \nthat deserve what we have given to the enslavers.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  I won't give up, friends. I will not. These are my people. I am not \nashamed to say that I am a proud descendant of the enslaved people who \nmade America great. I am not ashamed of it.\n  My dear brothers and sisters, my dear friends, I beg that you give \nconsideration to the legislation. Those who want to have further query \ncan call me, talk to me. I will be on the floor.\n  It would be no surprise, when I initially thought about introducing \nthe legislation, my thought was, well, we will just wait and introduce \nit and start asking for signatures. But, no, I want to make sure that \neverybody has an opportunity to read it, peruse it, dissect it, \nscrutinize it, and do all the things you need to do to make a decision. \nThen, once we file it, I am going to come back to this floor, and I am \ngoing to announce and thank the persons who have signed on to the \nlegislation. Anybody who signs on to this legislation deserves a word \nof gratitude, and I will be one of the many who will, hopefully, give \nthese expressions of gratitude. I plan to come back to the floor and \nsay to the public at large: We thank you for supporting this \nlegislation.\n  My hope is that we will get the signatures necessary for the benefit \nof the public at large. You cannot get this legislation passed in the \nHouse with a majority of votes. It will take 290 votes or more.\n\n[[Page H8528]]\n\n  I see the Parliamentarian looking in my direction. If I am incorrect, \nMadam Parliamentarian, will you give me some nod as to being correct or \nincorrect? She indicates that I am correct. So, now you have heard it \nfrom me and you have heard it echoed from the Parliamentarian: 290 \nvotes we will need, not 289, 290 people of goodwill who have the \ncourage to recognize the people who made America great.\n  Others have done things to make America great. I don't mean to \nminimize the efforts of any others. I just mean to maximize the efforts \nthat have been ignored, that have been, quite frankly, with \nintentionality pushed aside.\n  They are people who are ashamed to acknowledge that they are the \nproud descendants of the enslaved people who built this country. I am \nnot one of them, of course. But there are still people who are. They \nare ashamed. We have to change that. I want to do everything I can to \nbring about that change.\n  I will return to Al Edwards, the father of Juneteenth. I remember \nwhat he went through. He was my friend. I saw him suffer. I know about \nhis fight to rid South Africa of Apartheid, how he went to jail in that \nstruggle.\n  I am prepared to do whatever it takes, however long it takes, as long \nas I am in Congress.\n  Madam Speaker of the House of Representatives, I thank you for this \ntime, and I will be asking for additional time to have additional \ncommentary about this subject. I assure you that those who take this \nseriously will be doing the righteous thing, not just the right thing, \nbut the righteous thing.\n  Again, I will close with Maya Angelou's very powerful words. She \nreminded us that we--persons of my ilk, if you will--were:\n\n     Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\n     I am the dream and the hope of the slave.\n\n  I plan to fulfill their dreams.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-11-16"}

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 4118.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation is experiencing an epidemic of violence, \nparticularly gun violence, that is ravaging communities large and small \nacross the United States. Research shows that\n\n[[Page H8094]]\n\nviolence begets more violence. It is a vicious cycle.\n  H.R. 4118, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act, would provide grant \nfunding for community violence intervention programs and youth \nworkforce development programs to help prevent gun violence and other \nviolent crimes, and to provide critical support services to people and \ncommunities who are in dire need of help.\n  In addition to saving countless lives, it would also save billions of \ndollars. It is estimated that gun violence costs this Nation a \nstaggering $280 billion every single year.\n  This legislation would help establish evidence-based community \nviolence intervention, or CVI programs, staffed by specialists with \nties to their communities. These programs connect people at risk of \ncommitting violence, and those at risk of being victimized by violence, \nwith intensive counseling and support services.\n  Because we know that access to job training, apprenticeship, and \nother workforce development programs are effective tools in reducing \ncommunity violence, the bill would also support workforce development \nprograms for youth in communities that are disproportionately impacted \nby violence.\n  Experience tells us that these programs work, reducing rates of \nhomicide and other gun violence by as much as 50 percent. We must \ninvest in these remarkably effective programs so that we can finally \nbreak the cycle of violence, which has shattered so many communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  Steve Horsford for introducing \nthis important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), my friend and colleague, a member \nof the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is head-spinning that House Democrats \neither want to defund the police, as Judiciary member Cori Bush does, \nor they want to Federalize the police, as Judiciary Chairman Jerry \nNadler does. I am against both, here is why.\n  In my community, the voters in one of the reddest counties in Florida \nvoted to raise their own taxes to fund school resource officers. \nProtecting our schools was that important, and we understood that that \nwas the responsibility of our community.\n  Now, as places like Detroit, Chicago, almost every major metropolitan \narea in California, defund their police as some virtue signal, as some \nway to sacrifice the safety of their constituents on the altar of \nwokeism, now they want my Florida constituents to subsidize the bad \ndecisions that they make at the State and local level, both \nconstitutionally and practically.\n  The police power is not a power of the Federal Government, it is a \npower of our State and local governments. When we excessively entangle \nourselves in that, we do to law enforcement what we shamefully did to \neducation.\n  In our schools all across this land there was innovation, creativity, \nschool projects, different ways to learn. Then the Republicans and \nDemocrats joined with President Bush in passing the No Child Left \nBehind Act, and we got Common Core, in this theory that we had to have \nevery kid on the same page, in the same book, on the same day, and we \nlost what was so special about it. We don't want to do that now to law \nenforcement. You see, this entire package of legislation today is \nintended to do just that.\n  They don't want to fund the police. They want to edict the police to \nthe Federal dollar. That comes with a more efficient way to ensure \ncentralized decisionmaking, not the localized decisionmaking that our \nConstitution promises, and that has offered great promise to this \ncountry for generations.\n  Do not buy this theory that this legislation is intended to help law \nenforcement. The best thing we could do for law enforcement is get out \nof their way, have their back, and call out the politicians like those \nin Congress who keep trying to defund the police and devalue the \ncommitment they make to our communities.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I didn't know that the Federal Government \nfunding police was against the Republican Party position.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. \nHorsford), the sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, today, we have the opportunity to pass \nlandmark legislation to make our communities across America safe, to \nreduce crime and save lives.\n  I am elated that the legislation I authored, the Break the Cycle of \nViolence Act, is receiving a floor vote today and will pass.\n  I give special thanks to my colleagues, Representatives Robin Kelly, \nLucy McBath, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and   Joe Neguse for working around \nthe clock with me on this legislation, and Chairwoman Beatty for her \nstrong leadership.\n  Crime and violence don't happen in a vacuum. It happens when people \nlose hope and don't see opportunity in their lives or readily available \nin their communities. For decades, politicians in this Chamber have \nstoked fear about urban crime to divide us, while refusing to invest in \nreal solutions.\n  Let me be clear, my father was shot and killed when I was a teenager. \nSo this is not about politics for me; it is personal. That is why we \nhave to focus on preventing crime before it ever starts. That is what \nthe Break the Cycle of Violence Act will do.\n\n  It invests $5 billion in funding for anti-violence programs and $1.5 \nbillion to provide workforce training and job opportunities for youth \nages 16 to 24. This money will invest in proven, community-based \nviolence intervention programs to build safer communities. This is \nabout saving lives and preventing crime, and our constituents are \ncounting on us to get it done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as I prepare to cast a vote in favor \nof the Break the Cycle of Violence Act, historic legislation that will \nreduce crime and save lives so that so many people in our community \ndon't have to experience the pain that I have.\n  Every day, 110 Americans are killed with guns and over 200 are shot \nand wounded.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HORSFORD. Today, gun violence remains the leading cause of \npremature death for Black men as well as the number two cause of \npremature death for Latino men and Black women.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am casting my vote for my father; for my constituent, \nSean'Jerrion Coleman, a youth leader in Las Vegas; and so many other \nAmericans throughout the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Greg Jackson at Community Justice Action Fund; \nPastor Troy Martinez in Las Vegas; Erica Ford; Giffords: Courage to \nFight Gun Violence--some many other groups--Everytown for Gun Safety; \nBrady: United Against Gun Violence; and Moms Demand Action.\n  Let's pass H.R. 4118 and break the cycle of violence. This is about \nsupporting and funding the communities that need law enforcement.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Stauber).\n  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I find myself pretty upset today. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to deceive the \nAmerican people. Democrats are only bringing up these bills today \nbecause 46 days from a midterm election they want the American people \nto suddenly and miraculously believe that they care about the crime \ncrisis plaguing our Nation.\n  There were 219 Democrats who voted to defund the police and take away \nresources from law enforcement, including qualified immunity. There \nwere 219 Democrats who voted for legislation that effectively destroyed \nthe profession that I love so much. You can laugh, Mr. Chair, I wore \nthe uniform of local law enforcement, and that smirk upsets me.\n  Make no mistake, Democrats are the reason recruitment, retention, and \nmorale of law enforcement officers is at an all-time low and crime is \nat an all-time high. The timing of these bills is an insult to the law \nenforcement community and the American people.\n  To my Democrat colleagues: Where were you when the protesters came to \nmy State of Minnesota and set up\n\n[[Page H8095]]\n\nGoFundMe pages to raise money and bail out violent criminals who \nassaulted and beat innocent people?\n  Where were you when a Member of the California delegation came to \nMinnesota to stir up aggression and hatred toward my brothers and \nsisters in the blue and brown?\n  Where were you when officers were being violently assaulted and \nkilled each day across this country?\n  Where were you when America's police officers and their families were \nbegging for support and needed elected officials to have their backs? \nWhere were you?\n  I will tell you where you were. They were here in this Chamber \npushing police departments to be defunded. They wanted to defund, \ndismantle, and disarm the police.\n  Regardless of how I vote today, I have to tell you that I am furious \nthat days before an election, and for political purposes only, these \nbills are being brought up by my colleagues. The American people have \nsuffered enough, and at the end of the day the American people and our \nlaw enforcement community do not appreciate being used as pawns for \npolitical gain.\n  To the American people, I know the crime crisis you and your families \nare facing is very real. I will not stop my work to reinvigorate the \nlaw enforcement profession, to hold lax prosecutors accountable, and to \nput violent criminals away.\n  Mr. Speaker, my time in uniform may be over, but my watch will never \nend.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, if you could ever be fed up--I am fed \nup. Fed up, and fed up with the babbling that we are hearing from \nRepublicans on the other side.\n  You know, the question should be: Where were you on January 6 when \nlaw enforcement were bleeding on the steps of the United States \nCapitol, passing out, and dying? Where were you? This is not a \npolitical circumstance. These are people who are standing here because  \nSteve Horsford had a personal experience.\n  The Judiciary Committee has consistently supported intervention \nprograms dealing with countering violence. This bill, Break the Cycle \nof Violence Act, is needed in America. Stand up with us, Republicans. A \nbill that takes a vital step toward reducing community violence and \nimproving public safety by investing in people, their communities, and \nestablish evidence-based programs proven to help reduce violence. Our \nlaw enforcement are begging for this.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation has a crisis of violence, \nparticularly gun violence, and it is tearing at our communities.\n  I have a husband and a baby shot dead, the mother calling: Where is \nmy husband and baby? The baby is found dead.\n  The cause of gun violence, $280 billion, $700 annually for every \nAmerican, $488,000 for shootings dealing with medical and criminal \nexpenses.\n  My brothers and sisters, where are we in standing for America and law \nenforcement and families and children?\n  Support H.R. 4118 so that we can divert children away from violence \nand move toward opportunities. I don't know what you are saying. I am \nfed up. Do something about it so that we can fight for justice in this \ncountry and stand for people who want to be safe in their community.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4118, the ``Break the Cycle of \nViolence Act,'' a bill that takes a vital step towards reducing \ncommunity violence and improving public safety by investing in people, \ntheir communities, and established, evidence-based programs proven to \nhelp reduce violence.\n  Our nation has a crisis of violence, particularly gun violence, that \nis tearing our communities apart. Violent crime is not a blue or red \nstate problem--it ravages large cities, small towns, and even rural \ncommunities. It causes unspeakable pain to its victims and their \nfamilies--regardless of party affiliation.\n  The bill would provide $1.5 billion in workforce development grants \nfor youth in communities that are disproportionately impacted by \nviolence; and $5 billion in grants over 8 years for evidence-based, \ncommunity violence intervention programs likely to succeed--to develop \nand support:\n  community outreach programs, staffed by violence intervention \nspecialists with ties to their communities;\n  hospital-based violence intervention programs to provide intensive \ncounseling, peer support, and social services;\n  group violence intervention strategies that provide culturally \nresponsive support and services; and\n  violence interruption and crisis management initiatives that respond \nto and mediate potentially violent conflicts and provide support \nservices where violence has already occurred.\n  While the human cost of gun violence is at times overwhelming, the \neconomic costs for communities and taxpayers is also stunning. The \ntotal cost of gun violence is $280 billion--every year--with every \nAmerican bearing $700 of the cost annually as well.\n  Because a single gun homicide costs taxpayers $448,000 in medical and \ncriminal justice expenses and we know that community violence \nintervention programs have been shown to dramatically reduce rates of \nhomicide and other gun violence by as much as 50 percent--and sometimes \nmore--this bill will save lives and taxpayer dollars.\n  Many violence intervention programs work side-by-side with law \nenforcement to stop violence before it starts and engage in targeted \nenforcement actions. Trained violence interrupters and crisis \nmanagement specialists do the same, while also providing trauma-\ninformed grief counseling.\n  We know these programs work. In communities across the country, from \nNew Jersey to Nebraska, from Massachusetts to Missouri, community \nviolence intervention programs have reduced incidences of homicide and \nother gun violence by as much as 50 percent, sometimes more.\n  Recognizing the critical role that education, training, and viable \nemployment play in unlocking economic mobility, long-term stability, \nthereby preventing violence, H.R. 4118 would divert young people away \nfrom the circumstances that foster gun violence toward opportunities to \ngain useful skills to obtain good jobs that pay a living-wage.\n  If we are truly going to break the cycle of violence--we must \nacknowledge that violence is neither red nor blue--support programs \nthat address the root causes of violence, and give aid to those who \nneed it most--through the community members and leaders who know them \nbest.\n  I commend Representative Steven Horsford for his work on this \nimportant bill and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I would say, if this bill was so important--\nwe have had over 20 markups in the Judiciary Committee--why didn't this \nbill come up? We have had markups in the last 2 days on one occasion, \nso I don't know why this bill didn't come up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is about giving dollars to community organizers. \nThis bill is most definitely--$5 billion goes to Health and Human \nServices, $1.5 billion goes to the Department of Labor, zero money goes \nto law enforcement.\n  In the last bill, they could at least make that case somewhat. This \nbill you can't. It doesn't give one penny to law enforcement. In fact, \nthe legislation explicitly says it can't go to police officers and it \ncan't go to police departments.\n  But what it does do is this: sets up an Office of Community Violence \nIntervention to administer programs or activities related to violence \nintervention; it sets up a Community Violence Intervention Advisory \nCommittee; it sets up a National Community Violence Response Center. \nThree new bureaucracies in the Department of HHS. I mean, wow.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  This is all about taking money, taking American tax dollars from \ncommunities who did fund their police and setting up three new \nbureaucracies, $5 billion for community organizers.\n  If that is what you are for, vote for it, but I sure ain't. I know \nthe folks I represent and, I would guess, most Americans aren't for \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Jordan apparently isn't listening. This \nis a package of bills. The last bill, which\n\n[[Page H8096]]\n\nhe opposed, appropriated money for police. This bill complements it by \nappropriating money for antiviolence intervention.\n  Mr. Speaker, our communities have seen enough violence and bloodshed. \nThe Break the Cycle of Violence Act gives us the opportunity to prevent \nviolence before it starts and to provide critical support to our most \nimpacted communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis crucial legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1377, the \nprevious question is ordered on the bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-10-01"}

CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS REPORTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 10 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 639) is amended by inserting after subsection (a) the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Cybersecurity Reports.--\n       ``(1) Annual report.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this subsection, and every year \n     thereafter, the Administrator shall submit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that includes--\n       ``(A) a strategy to increase the cybersecurity of \n     information technology infrastructure of the Administration;\n       ``(B) a supply chain risk management strategy and an \n     implementation plan to address the risks of foreign \n     manufactured information technology equipment utilized by the \n     Administration, including specific risk mitigation activities \n     for components originating from entities with principal \n     places of business located in the People's Republic of China; \n     and\n       ``(C) an account of--\n       ``(i) any incident that occurred at the Administration \n     during the 2-year period preceding the date on which the \n     first report is submitted, and, for subsequent reports, the \n     1-year period preceding the date of submission; and\n       ``(ii) any action taken by the Administrator to respond to \n     or remediate any such incident.\n       ``(2) FISMA reports.--Each report required under paragraph \n     (1) may be submitted as part of the report required under \n     section 3554 of title 44, United States Code.\n       ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to affect the reporting requirements of \n     the Administrator under chapter 35 of title 44, United States \n     Code, in particular the requirement to notify the Federal \n     information security incident center under section \n     3554(b)(7)(C)(ii) of such title, any guidance\n\n[[Page H8737]]\n\n     issued by the Office of Management and Budget, or any other \n     provision of law or Federal policy.\n       ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     `appropriate congressional committees' means--\n       ``(i) the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     of the Senate;\n       ``(ii) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate;\n       ``(iii) the Committee on Small Business of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       ``(iv) the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       ``(B) Incident.--The term `incident' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 3552 of title 44, United States Code.\n       ``(C) Information technology.--The term `information \n     technology' has the meaning given the term in section 3502 of \n     title 44, United States Code.''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, provide to the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the \n     Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, \n     and the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of \n     Representatives a detailed account of information technology \n     (as defined in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code) \n     of the Small Business Administration that was manufactured by \n     an entity that has its principal place of business located in \n     the People's Republic of China.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Velazquez) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nLuetkemeyer) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank all the members of the Small Business Committee \nfor their hard work this Congress on behalf of our Nation's 32 million \nsmall business owners.\n  These bills will help small firms in a number of areas: strengthen \ncybersecurity and broadband access, improve exporting, and enhance \nrecovery assistance from natural disasters.\n  They are the product of the bipartisan and bicameral work of the \nHouse and Senate Small Business Committees. I hope that we can come \ntogether today and approve these bills.\n  First, we will consider H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, as \namended and passed by the Senate. For more than 20 years, the SBA's IG \nhas listed IT security as one of the most serious management and \nperformance challenges for SBA. These vulnerabilities were exposed \nduring the rollout of the SBA COVID-19 relief programs.\n  The unprecedented demand for programs like PPP and the COVID EIDL \noverwhelmed the SBA's legacy system, leading to back-end crashes, slow \nportal operations, and a breach that exposed applicants' personal \ninformation. SBA failed to make any public announcement about the data \nbreach, and it took weeks for the agency to send paper notifications to \naffected individuals.\n  H.R. 3462 would require the SBA to assess its cybersecurity \nprocedures and submit a cybersecurity report to Congress within 180 \ndays of passage and annually thereafter.\n  SBA possesses sensitive information belonging to countless American \nsmall business owners. We must ensure this data is protected from bad \nactors in cyberspace.\n  The Senate-passed version we are voting on today reinforces reporting \nrequirements established by the Federal Information Security Management \nAct of 2002.\n  I support the changes and thank the Senate for improving this \nlegislation. I thank Mr. Crow of Colorado and Mrs. Kim of California \nfor introducing and championing this bill. Their relentless efforts on \nthis issue is why we are here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3462, as amended by \nthe Senate, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume and rise in support of H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, \nas amended by the Senate.\n  Cyberattacks are too common in today's world. They cost the U.S. \neconomy billions of dollars each year and have the ability to harm and \nshut down small businesses, which often operate on the thinnest of \nmargins.\n  Any cyber intrusion on a small business creates great pain and \nuncertainty. H.R. 3462 takes important steps to enhance and support our \nsmall businesses and the Federal Government from bad actors.\n  This bill strengthens cybersecurity operations at the Small Business \nAdministration by requiring the agency to issue a report to Congress \nthat assesses its ability to respond to cyber threats.\n  Additionally, H.R. 3462 requires the SBA to assess its own \ncybersecurity framework and report on any incidents in a timely \nfashion.\n  H.R. 3462 passed the House last year with a vote of 423-0, Mr. \nSpeaker, and was recently approved by the Senate with an amendment to \nstrengthen reporting requirements by focusing on supply chain and \nforeign technology risk.\n  I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Kim), and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) for \nworking together to protect small businesses, as well as our Senate \ncolleagues who worked on this bill. I also thank the chair for pushing \nthis bill forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 3462, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Crow).\n  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3462, the \nbipartisan SBA Cyber Awareness Act.\n  The Small Business Administration supports small businesses in every \ncorner of the country. With the support of Congress, the SBA has gone \nto bat for small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through relief \nprograms like PPP and EIDL. Yet, year after year, the SBA's Office of \nInspector General has found that IT security is one of the agency's \nmost serious management and performance challenges.\n  The pandemic highlighted the gaps in the agency's cybersecurity. As a \nresult of high demand, a glitch in the EIDL application exposed the \npersonal information of over 8,000 applicants.\n  We need to bolster the SBA's cybersecurity so that the SBA can better \nprotect small businesses' information and continue to help small \nbusinesses nationwide.\n  My bill, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, would direct the SBA to issue \nan annual report on the agency's cybersecurity strategy, as well as \ndisclosure of recent threats and breaches. Under this bill, the SBA \nwould also report on its supply chain risk management strategy and \nissue a plan to address the risks of foreign manufactured information \ntechnology used by the agency, including components originating from \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and a similar \nversion passed the House of Representatives unopposed last year in \nNovember 2021.\n  I thank the bill's Republican co-lead, Representative Young Kim, for \nher support, as well as Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member \nLuetkemeyer, and the staff of the Small Business Committee, all of whom \nhave been critical in advancing this measure.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me again in supporting this \ncommonsense bill to support SBA cybersecurity.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, the threat of a cyberattack on a small business is \nconstant. A cyber intrusion, no matter the magnitude, could have \ndevastating and consequential impacts for the Nation's smallest \nbusinesses.\n  We must ensure the agency charged with helping the Nation's over 33 \nmillion small businesses is prepared. H.R. 3462 and the Senate's \ncorresponding amendment do just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation \nbefore us today that will better protect the Federal Government and \nAmerica's small businesses from cyberattack, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H8738]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the average cost of a data breach in the United States \nis over $9 million. For small businesses operating on razor-thin \nmargins, an event like this can be catastrophic.\n  Small businesses must be confident that SBA systems are fully \noperational and capable of protecting their sensitive data. H.R. 3462 \nwill go a long way toward rebuilding trust in the agency's IT \ninfrastructure.\n  I thank my colleagues, Mr. Crow of Colorado and Mrs. Kim of \nCalifornia, for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment \nto the bill, H.R. 3462, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) that the House suspend the \nrules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 3462.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-12-09"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``One Stop Shop for Small \n     Business Compliance Act of 2021''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CENTRALIZED WEBSITE FOR COMPLIANCE GUIDES.\n\n       Section 30 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(e) Centralized Website.--Not later than 6 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Ombudsman \n     shall maintain a publicly available website that includes--\n       ``(1) hyperlinks to small entity compliance guides \n     described under section 212(a)(1) of the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996; and\n       ``(2) with respect to each such small entity compliance \n     guide, the contact information for an individual who can \n     offer assistance to small entities with respect to the rules \n     that are the subject of such guide.\n       ``(f) Report on Agency Compliance.--The Ombudsman shall \n     include in the annual report required under subsection \n     (b)(2)(C) an assessment of agency compliance with the \n     requirements of section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 for the year covered by such \n     annual report.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Velazquez) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nLuetkemeyer) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the measure under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop \nfor Small Business Compliance Act of 2021, which will require SBA's \nOffice of the National Ombudsman to maintain a centralized website for \nregulatory compliance guides.\n  Federal agencies are required by the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act to publish small entity compliance guides for \neach rule requiring a regulatory flexibility analysis.\n  These compliance guides are meant to explain Federal rules in easy-\nto-understand terms for small businesses and help them comply with \nFederal regulations that protect our environment, health, and consumer \nsafety. However, small businesses do not always have the resources to \nnavigate multiple agencies' websites to find these guides.\n  H.R. 4877 will ensure the Office of the National Ombudsman maintains \nan updated centralized website containing links to each agency's small \nbusiness compliance guides and their relevant points of contact.\n  This simple step will significantly reduce the administrative burden \non entrepreneurs, make compliance easier, and allow them to spend more \ntime doing what they do best--running their businesses and creating \njobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Delgado and Van Duyne for \nworking in a bipartisan manner to advance this bill to assist small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop for \nSmall Business Compliance Act of 2021.\n  Federal agencies are required to publish small business compliance \nguides for certain regulations. Presently, these guides are housed in \ndifferent agency websites making it difficult for small businesses to \nfind and utilize.\n  This bipartisan legislation will create a one-stop-shop that will \nmake it easier for small businesses to comply with Federal regulations. \nThis bill will also require the centralized website to list contact \ninformation for the appropriate agency staff who could provide \nregulatory assistance to small businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado) and \nthe gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne) for working in tandem to \nbring this issue to the forefront.\n  H.R. 4877 passed out of committee by a voice vote and similar \nlanguage passed the House floor in the 116th Congress. I encourage all \nMembers to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page H4474]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Delgado).\n  Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, we all know that the past couple of years \nhave been difficult on small businesses. COVID-19 upended life as we \nknew it. While America is turning a corner from the perspective of \npublic health, the pandemic's aftershocks are still raising costs, \nscrambling supply chains, and disrupting labor markets.\n  That is what I heard from folks in Cooperstown last month when I \ninvited the SBA administrator to tour Main Street with me. That is what \nI heard a few days ago when I visited small businesses in Tannersville \nin Greene County. That is what I regularly hear from small \nbusinessowners at my townhall meetings across the district. That is why \nCongress should be doing everything it can to reduce burdens on small \nbusiness owners. That is what my bipartisan bill, the One Stop Shop for \nSmall Business Compliance Act, would do.\n  In 1996, Congress passed a law requiring Federal agencies to publish \neasy-to-use regulation compliance guides for small businesses; a good \nidea that was poorly implemented.\n  The problem is, these guides are housed on different agency websites, \nmaking it difficult for small businesses to find and utilize them. If \nyou want to find something for OSHA, you have to go to the OSHA \nwebsite. If you want to find FTC's compliance guide, you go look around \nat FTC.gov. These guides are scattered across countless government \nwebsites.\n  My bill is simple, it would require the Small Business \nAdministrator's Office of the National Ombudsman to create a \ncentralized website that houses all Federal agency compliance guides in \none place.\n  By creating a one-stop-shop online, we make these guides more \naccessible for small business owners who often lack the resources to \nhire staff to focus on compliance issues. The platform would also list \ncontact information for the appropriate agency staff who could provide \nregulatory assistance to small businesses.\n  Small businesses are essential elements of the economic and social \nfabric of upstate New York. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation \nwhich will make it easier, not harder, for folks back home to run their \nbusinesses and access resources from the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne for her partnership \non this bipartisan, commonsense legislation. I thank Chairwoman \nVelazquez and Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for their support, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, in closing, having the rules of the \nroad clearly and succinctly in one location for all small business \nowners is instrumental. The One Stop Shop for Small Business Compliance \nAct of 2021 will ensure this occurs at the SBA.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for advancing this legislation that \nbetter informs the Nation's small businesses, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, small employers have \nexperienced great hardships throughout the pandemic, but today we have \nthe opportunity to make it easier, not harder, to comply with Federal \nregulations.\n  The ombudsman's centralized website will streamline the compliance \nprocess for small businesses and ensure they have the most accurate and \nupdated information.\n  I thank the committee members for their diligence in advancing this \npiece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'', and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4877.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-05-02"}

Res. 734\n\n       Whereas the Senate wishes to recognize traffic incident \n     management responders (as described in the Traffic Incident \n     Management Handbook of the Federal Highway Administration), \n     which include law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency \n     medical services, tow truck operators, and transportation \n     workers;\n       Whereas, due to the increasingly high rate of distracted \n     drivers on the roadway, many traffic incident management \n     responders lose their lives while performing their duties \n     each year;\n       Whereas, in 2021, 65 traffic incident management responders \n     were killed in the United States due to roadside collisions;\n       Whereas the Federal Highway Administration and the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the Department of \n     Transportation host the Crash Responder Safety Week annually \n     in November as a national effort to--\n       (1) protect traffic incident management responders who are \n     at the scene of highway crashes; and\n       (2) remind the public of their responsibility to use \n     caution when driving near roadside incidents involving \n     traffic incident management responders;\n       Whereas each State has a move over law, which has \n     correlated directly with a safer environment along the \n     roadsides of the United States for traffic incident \n     management responders and stranded citizens;\n       Whereas move over laws generally require motorists to move \n     at least 1 lane over when there is an emergency or rescue \n     activity taking place on the shoulder or side of the roadway, \n     or, if unable to do so safely, to slow down and pass the \n     scene with caution;\n       Whereas the Government Accountability Office report \n     entitled ``Emergency Responder Safety: States and DOT Are \n     Implementing Actions to Reduce Roadside Crashes'' (GAO-21-\n     166) noted that State officials cite raising public awareness \n     as the most prevalent challenge to move over laws; and\n       Whereas providing traffic incident management responders an \n     enhanced opportunity to inform the motoring public about \n     these laws is critical to the public safety: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National Move Over \n     Law Day; and\n       (2) urges the national, State, and regional incident \n     management organizations--\n       (A) to spread awareness and promote the existence of, and \n     adherence to, State move over laws; and\n       (B) to educate the public further on the dangers and loss \n     of life that occur if State move over laws are not faithfully \n     observed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-08-12"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and \n     Norman Y. Mineta Department of Transportation Headquarters \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The headquarters building of the Department of \n     Transportation located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, in \n     Washington, DC, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal \n     Building''.\n\n     SEC. 3. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the building referred \n     to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal \n     Building''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Webster) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on S. 400, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 400, as amended, a bill to \nname the headquarters building of the Department of Transportation \nlocated at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, in Washington, D.C. as the \nWilliam T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal Building.\n  The text we are considering today represents an agreement reached \nwith the Senate and reconciles the differences between S. 400 and my \nbill, H.R. 4679, which passed the House last November. This compromise \nlanguage pays tribute to two American patriots, William T. Coleman, Jr. \nand Norman Yishio Mineta.\n  William T. Coleman, Jr. led a life of extraordinary achievement. He \nattended a segregated elementary school, graduated summa cum laude from \nthe University of Pennsylvania, and was accepted into Harvard School of \nLaw. He left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Forces, trained with the \nTuskegee Airmen, after which he returned to Harvard Law School and \ngraduated first in his class.\n  He was the first African-American clerk on the Supreme Court. He also \nworked with Thurgood Marshall on the legal team preparing the briefs in \nBrown v. Board of Education, served as president and chairman of the \nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and argued 19 cases before \nthe Supreme Court. Mr. Coleman was the second African American to serve \nin a White House Cabinet, after being appointed Transportation \nSecretary by President Gerald R. Ford in March 1975.\n  Norman Y. Mineta also has an extraordinary life story. He, along with \nhis family, suffered the grave injustice of being forcibly relocated \nand interned during World War II, but he was not bitter toward his \ngovernment. Instead, he spent his career serving his country by \nparticipating in and improving government.\n  For almost 30 years, Norm represented San Jose, California, on the \ncity council, then as mayor, and from 1975 to 1995 as a Member of \nCongress. He served on the Committee on Public Works and Transportation \nduring his entire time in Congress. He chaired the Subcommittee on \nAviation, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, and he chaired \nthe full committee for one full term.\n  Norm's skills and accomplishments were widely recognized. He was \nPresident Bill Clinton's Secretary of Commerce and President George W. \nBush's Secretary of Transportation, where he was the longest-serving \nSecretary of Transportation in U.S. history.\n  Following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, Secretary Mineta \nguided the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, an \nagency with more than 65,000 employees, the largest mobilization of a \nnew Federal agency since World War II.\n  For their contributions to this institution, to our government, and \nto the field of transportation, Secretary William T. Coleman, Jr. and \nSecretary Mineta deserve this recognition. I strongly support this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3989]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, S. 400, as amended, designates the United States \nDepartment of Transportation headquarters as the William T. Coleman, \nJr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal Building.\n  William Coleman had a long history of public service, including \nserving as the fourth Secretary of Transportation, as a civil rights \nleader and, early in his career, by serving the Nation during World War \nII.\n  Norman Mineta served as chair and ranking member of the Committee on \nPublic Works and Transportation. He was later appointed as the 14th \nSecretary of Transportation under President George W. Bush and is the \nlongest-serving Secretary of Transportation to date.\n  I think it is fitting to recognize the work and commitment of both \nSecretaries by naming the DOT headquarters after them. I urge support \nof the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  In closing, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 400. This bill \nappropriately recognizes both Norm Mineta and William Coleman for their \nservice to our country and the United States Department of \nTransportation.\n  I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto close.\n  I have already spoken strongly for this bill, for the Department of \nTransportation building to be named in honor of William T. Coleman and \nNorm Mineta.\n  I just want to add a personal note. I served with Norm Mineta for 8 \nyears, and he was a great chairman and mentor. Between him and Jim \nOberstar, I owe them a lot for my success in Congress and for the \nleadership in this committee, so I am really pleased that we can do \nthis today. I would expect it will pass the House unanimously, but \nthere are inane people on the other side of the aisle who insist on \nvoting on everything for no apparent reason, so I expect we will end up \nwith a recorded vote, but I expect that will be unanimous.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 400, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-04-10"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Japanese American World War \n     II History Network Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. JAPANESE AMERICAN WORLD WAR II HISTORY NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     establish, within the National Park Service, a program to be \n     known as the ``Japanese American World War II History \n     Network'' (hereinafter referred to as the ``Network'').\n       (b) Duties of Secretary.--In carrying out the Network, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (1) review studies and reports to complement and not \n     duplicate studies of Japanese American World War II history \n     and Japanese American experiences during World War II, \n     including studies related to relocation centers and \n     confinement sites, that are underway or completed;\n       (2) produce and disseminate appropriate educational \n     materials, such as handbooks, maps, interpretive guides, or \n     electronic information relating to Japanese American World \n     War II history and Japanese American experiences during the \n     war, including relocation centers and confinement sites;\n       (3) enter into appropriate cooperative agreements and \n     memoranda of understanding to provide technical assistance \n     under subsection (c); and\n       (4)(A) create and adopt an official, uniform symbol or \n     device for the Network; and\n       (B) issue regulations for the use of the symbol or device \n     adopted under subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Elements.--The Network shall encompass the following \n     elements:\n       (1) All units and programs of the National Park Service \n     that are determined by the Secretary to relate to Japanese \n     American World War II history and Japanese American \n     experiences during the war, including relocation centers and \n     confinement sites.\n       (2) With the consent of the property owner, other Federal, \n     State, local, Tribal, and privately owned properties that--\n       (A) relate to Japanese American World War II history and \n     Japanese experiences during the war, including relocation \n     centers and confinement sites;\n       (B) have a verifiable connection to Japanese American World \n     War II history and Japanese experiences during the war, \n     including relocation and confinement sites; and\n       (C) are included in, or determined by the Secretary to be \n     eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic \n     Places.\n       (3) Other governmental and nongovernmental facilities and \n     programs of an educational, research, or interpretive nature \n     that are directly related to Japanese American World War II \n     history and the experiences of Japanese Americans during the \n     war, including relocation centers and confinement sites.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material for the measure under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6434, the Japanese American \nWorld War II History Network Act, introduced by my Natural Resources \nCommittee colleague, Representative Jay Obernolte.\n  This bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish the \nJapanese American World War II History Network within the National Park \nService.\n  Between 1942 and 1945, the U.S. Government wrongfully imprisoned \napproximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom were U.S. \ncitizens. Many of the U.S. Government's activities during World War II \nwere done in secrecy and were not accurately represented to the public \nin the years after the war.\n  Designating this network will support education and awareness of the \npeople, places, and events that were associated with the wrongful \nincarceration of Japanese Americans.\n  This effort will be a welcome complement to the existing Japanese \nAmerican Confinement Sites Grant Program, which we are looking to \nreauthorize and strengthen today through Representative Matsui's \nlegislation, which we considered earlier this afternoon.\n  I thank Representative Obernolte for championing this legislation, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6434, offered by my \ncommittee colleague, Mr. Obernolte of California, to establish a \nJapanese American World War II History Network within the National Park \nService.\n  As Chairman Grijalva stated, this bill is complementary to the \nprevious bill we considered today with the JACS program in it.\n  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, tens of thousands of Japanese \nAmericans were forcibly removed from the West Coast to relocation \ncenters across the United States. Japanese\n\n[[Page H3733]]\n\nAmericans were imprisoned without trial and forced to relocate to some \nof the most remote areas of our country, with few personal belongings. \nMy State of Arkansas was home to two relocation camps, Rohwer in Desha \nCounty and Jerome in Chicot and Drew Counties.\n  Mr. Obernolte's bill, which I have proudly cosponsored, would \nestablish a cohesive national network to increase the visibility of all \nsites related to the Japanese American experience during World War II. \nThe network will be similar to existing networks established in recent \nyears to connect sites associated with the Underground Railroad, the \nReconstruction era, and the African American civil rights movement.\n  At the legislative hearing, Mr. Bruce Saito, chair of the Friends of \nManzanar, testified about this critical network, saying: ``We must \ncontinue to strengthen the network and continue to connect the dots \nthrough the network so this tragic and very important lesson in history \nis never forgotten.''\n  The new network will be an important tool to ensure that this \nhistory, no matter how painful it may be, is always remembered, and the \nimportant stories of interned Japanese Americans are told with honor \nand respect.\n  In addition to the Friends of Manzanar, we have received letters of \nsupport from the Amache Preservation Society, the National Conference \nof State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Japanese American \nHistorical Society, and the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program.\n  I commend Mr. Obernolte for his work on this important legislation \nthat will help future generations learn from and reflect on the \nexperiences of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support, \nand I thank Mr. Obernolte for introducing the legislation. I urge \nadoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Obernolte, our colleague on \nthe committee, and Ms. Matsui, a former colleague on the committee, for \ntwo pieces of very important legislation that look at the realism that \nwe need to look at in terms of our history as a Nation. They are \ncomplementary and good pieces of legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge approval, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 6434.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-03-24"}

Mr. President, I wish to expand upon the remarks I \ndelivered earlier today on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which \nthis body voted to include in the omnibus spending package. I first \nintroduced this bill in 2012 with Senator Shaheen. Senator Cassidy \njoined us this Congress, and the bill now has broad, bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a very straightforward piece of \nlegislation; it closes a loophole in the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination \nAct to allow pregnant workers to request reasonable accommodations so \nthat they can continue working safely during pregnancy and upon \nreturning to work after childbirth. This is a commonsense bill that has \nbroad, bipartisan support--everyone from the ACLU to the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops to the Chamber of Commerce.\n  The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is very simple. Pregnant workers \nshould be able to request reasonable accommodations--a stool, a water \nbottle, a bathroom break--when such an accommodation would help them \nremain at work safely during their pregnancy and so they can return to \nwork after childbirth. Other accommodations that a pregnant worker \nmight request include, but are not limited to, light duty, temporary \ntransfer, additional or more flexible breaks, changing food or drink \npolicies, time off to recover from childbirth, accommodations for \nlactation needs, and flexible scheduling.\n  The bill is intended to help women like Peggy Young, a UPS driver who \nrequested light duty while she was pregnant. Peggy was denied her \nrequest, even though other workers had received light duty, because \nthere is no requirement under the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act to \nprovide reasonable accommodations. She was forced onto unpaid leave and \neventually took her case all the way to the Supreme Court. She won, but \nthe ruling did not provide full protections to the millions of workers \nwho get pregnant each year. That is why we need the Pregnant Workers \nFairness Act, so that every pregnant worker will be able to request an \naccommodation without fear of being fired or forced on leave, when all \nshe needs is a stool or a bathroom break.\n  Young did not solve this issue, and the standard is still unworkable \nfor employers and pregnant workers. After Young, over two-thirds of \nwomen still lost their Pregnancy Discrimination Act pregnancy \naccommodation claims in court, mostly because they were unable to find \na suitable comparator under the Young comparator framework. Pregnant \nworkers need immediate relief to remain healthy and on the job. \nPregnant workers should not have to muster evidence and identify \nsomeone else at work to get their own medically necessary \naccommodation, as basic as a stool or extra restroom breaks. Pregnant \nworkers, especially in low-wage industries, usually do not have access \nto their coworkers' personnel files and do not know how all their \ncoworkers are being treated.\n  The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would create a clear, explicit \nright to accommodations, allowing pregnant workers to remain healthy \nand attached to the workforce. It is a solution that provides clarity \nto both employers and employees. That is why the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and other business groups support the Pregnant Workers \nFairness Act.\n  The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act sets up a simple framework that is \neasily understood and utilized by both employers and employees. Under \nthe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a pregnant employee may request \nreasonable accommodations from their employer, the same process that \nindividuals with disabilities use under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. Employers are familiar with it, the interactive process is easier \nfor both the worker and the employer.\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\n  Workers will be able to secure the accommodations they need in a \ntimely manner, while employers will avoid costly litigation over \nallegations of discrimination. A significant advantage of using this \nsame framework is that employers are already familiar with it--and have \nover 30 years' experience providing reasonable accommodations to people \nwith disabilities already.\n  Over the years, I and my colleagues--along with supporters of the \nlegislation--have worked carefully to ensure that the Pregnant Workers \nFairness Act will both protect pregnant workers from discrimination and \nprovide actionable, realistic parameters and guidance for employers. \nThat is why, as I mentioned previously, the bill has the support of \nover 200 advocacy groups from all parts of the ideological spectrum.\n  Now, some have claimed that the Americans with Disabilities Act--\nADA--already gives pregnant workers who truly need accommodations a \nright to accommodations. That is simply not true. It is not what we are \nseeing on the ground or what courts are deciding in their rulings.\n  First, the ADA does not protect pregnant workers who need \naccommodations to prevent complications from arising in the first \nplace, such as extra restroom breaks to prevent a urinary tract \ninfection or temporary light duty to prevent a miscarriage, which \ndoctors sometimes advise.\n  Second, many courts have held that the ADA does not protect even \nthose pregnant workers with serious pregnancy complications like a \nhigh-risk pregnancy, bleeding, or severe nausea. That has remained the \ncase even after Congress expanded the ADA in 2008. Clearly, the ADA, \nwhile a vitally important law, is not adequate to keep pregnant workers \nhealthy and on the job.\n  It is time to step up and protect pregnant workers who just need a \nlittle help--a water bottle, a stool, light duty--in order to keep \nworking safely. This is the right thing to do. The Pregnant Workers \nFairness Act is a reasonable and responsible bill that will help \nworkers continue working safely during pregnancy and after childbirth. \nWith broad support and a framework that is already familiar to \nemployers, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a commonsense, \nbipartisan bill that should be enacted without delay.\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Senator Cassidy, \nwho has been a true partner on this bill, along with our staffs; \nSenator Shaheen, for cosponsoring with me all these years; Senator \nMurray and Senator Burr for their work to shepherd the bill through the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the majority \nleader, Senator Schumer, for helping us to see this bill through the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>", "date": "2022-12-24"}
