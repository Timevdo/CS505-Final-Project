Mr. Speaker, a lot can happen in a year: a woman \ncan deliver a newborn; a child can learn to walk; and a small virus \nleaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, can go around the globe and cause a \nglobal pandemic.\n  While the first two are joyous, the latter, and the 1-year \nanniversary of the Biden administration, is nothing to celebrate. We \nhave the highest inflation in 40 years, and you don't need a graph to \nshow that. We see it each day when we go to fill up our tank or go to \nthe grocery store.\n  We have the end of American energy independence and a plea to OPEC to \nincrease petroleum production; record-high numbers of illegal border \ncrossings; almost double legal immigration, with no COVID-19 testing; \nrecord-high illegal drug crossings, especially synthetic fentanyl, with \nrecord-high overdoses, especially in our young population, 18 to 45; \nrecord-high homicides and crime in blue States; a disastrous withdrawal \nfrom Afghanistan, Saigon 2.0, with a loss of billions in equipment and \nthe lives of 13 of our servicemen and -women.\n  The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has led to increased \ninstability with Russia and China.\n  We have a vaccine mandate that ignores science, which shows that both \nthe delta virus can transmit, even if vaccinated and boosted, and \nomicron wanes within 1 month.\n  My advice to this administration: End the vaccine mandate; stop what \nyou are doing; and go on vacation.\n\n[[Page H256]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the award of a \nCongressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the Iran hostage crisis \nthat were released, after 444 days of captivity, 41 years ago today.\n  On November 4, 1979, Iranian student militants stormed the U.S. \nEmbassy in Tehran and took Embassy employees captive. Despite mock \nfiring squads, beatings, solitary confinement, lack of food, and \npsychological torture, the American hostages maintained their strength \nand resilience.\n  Back at home, Americans remained united in their support for the \nhostages, many tying yellow ribbons around trees as a sign of \nsolidarity. The former hostages have never received proper recognition \nfrom their government for their sacrifices.\n  This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our Nation's ability to come \ntogether to honor these American heroes. As of today, the bill has over \n166 cosponsors.\n  Special thanks to Commission 52 and Chairman Brock Pierce for helping \nto gather support for the bill.

Mr. Speaker, this week marks 1 year of \nPresident Biden's out-of-touch, reckless, and disastrous Presidency.\n  The past 12 months have been filled with failure after failure, and \nAmericans are dealing with the consequences at every corner.\n  From skyrocketing inflation, increased crime rates, a disastrous \nAfghanistan exit, an open border agenda, concerned parents labeled as \ndomestic terrorists, and more, this administration has failed the \nAmerican people.\n  Amidst all the crises, President Biden has spent a quarter of his \nfirst year in his Delaware basement, avoiding all responsibilities. \nThis is unacceptable from anyone.\n  I came to Congress to serve the people of Texas' 25th Congressional \nDistrict, and when I am back home, I hear firsthand how Texans are \nworse off under President Biden than ever before.\n  The bottom line is, a year of the Biden administration's socialist \nand far-left agenda has dragged our country backward, not forward.\n  It is time America has leaders that put America first.

Now, we are at over \n80,000.\n  I secondly ask that we convene a bipartisan group to get back down to \n20,000 a month to cross the border.\n  Finally, at the time President Trump was President, he was given a \ncocktail which cured his COVID illness almost immediately. That \ncocktail should be available to all Americans.\n  I, again, encourage a joint conference with us to get together and \ncure the people who get COVID.\n  Finally, Mr. President, stop being so divisive and screaming racism \nright and left.

Mr. Speaker, people have been traveling \nacross the Merrill and Ring Creek Bridge in Everett, Washington, since \nHerbert Hoover was President of the United States.\n  Every day, residents drive, walk, pedal, and roll across the bridge \nto get to and from work and school in Everett and to catch a ferry in \nMukilteo.

Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Washington \ncommunities will receive more than $605 million over the next 5 years \nto invest in critical bridge repairs.\n  Last week, Everett officials took me across the Merrill and Ring \nCreek Bridge and told me how this bold, long-term investment will \ncreate jobs, drive economic recovery, and keep people on the move.\n  Mr. Speaker, you cannot have a big-league economy with little-league \ninfrastructure.

He returned to the \nUniversity of Georgia his junior year and earned a starting role.\n  This past season, Stetson Bennett spearheaded the Dawgs to their \nfirst college football national championship in 42 years. The dream has \nbecome reality.\n  Stetson inspires me and will inspire others for many years to come.\n  Congratulations, and go Dawgs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4673, as amended, my \nbill, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.\n  I have made suicide prevention a top priority for the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. Last Congress, we passed bipartisan, bicameral \nmental health legislative packages, including the Commander John Scott \nHannon Veterans Mental Health Improvement Act and the Veterans COMPACT \nAct. This Congress, we continued this work by passing the Sergeant \nKetchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act into law, but there is always \nmore to do.\n  EVEST builds on our work and finally closes one of the most glaring \ngaps for veterans being able to successfully access high-quality VA \nhealth services, the enrollment process. We shouldn't be trying to hide \nVA care from those who earned it.\n  We know that the months following transition out of the military can \nbe very stressful and particularly risky for new veterans in terms of \nmental health. With the EVEST Act, servicemembers will be automatically \nenrolled in VA care during their transition out of the military, with \nthe choice to opt out. This helps simplify the process and prevents \nveterans from potentially missing out on lifesaving care. It also keeps \nveterans from having to opt into VA care later and attempt to navigate \na new bureaucracy all on their own.\n  The symptoms of PTSD can be significantly improved in veterans who \nreceive prompt mental healthcare. A 2014 study led by researchers at \nthe San Francisco VA Medical Center looked at nearly 40,000 Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans who received VA mental\n\n[[Page H258]]\n\nhealthcare between 2001 and 2011 and had a post-deployment diagnosis of \nPTSD. They found that veterans who sought and received care soon after \nthe end of their service had lower levels of PTSD upon follow-up a year \nafter they initiated care. Each year that a veteran waited to initiate \ntreatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of their \nPTSD either not improving or getting worse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the study from the San Francisco \nVA Medical Center.\n\n                 [From Psychiatric Services, Dec. 2014]\n\n Timing of Mental Health Treatment and PTSD Symptom Improvement Among \n                     Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans\n\n (By Shira Maguen, Ph.D.; Erin Madden, M.P.H.; Thomas C.

The authors sought to determine whether \n     time between last deployment and initiating mental health \n     treatment was associated with a lack of improvement in PTSD \n     symptoms.\n\n\n                                Methods\n\n       The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of existing \n     medical records of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who enrolled \n     in VA health care, received a postdeployment PTSD diagnosis, \n     and initiated treatment for one or more mental health \n     problems between October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, and \n     whose records contained results of PTSD screening at the \n     start of treatment and approximately one year later \n     (N=39,690).\n\n\n                                Results\n\n       At the start of treatment, 75% of veterans diagnosed as \n     having PTSD had a positive PTSD screen. At follow-up, 27% of \n     those with a positive screen at baseline had improved, and \n     43% of those with a negative screen at baseline remained \n     negative. A negative PTSD screen at follow-up was associated \n     with female gender, older age, white race, having never \n     married, officer rank, non-Army service, closer proximity to \n     the nearest VA facility, and earlier initiation of treatment \n     after the end of the last deployment.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Interventions to reduce delays in initiating mental health \n     treatment may improve veterans' treatment response. Further \n     studies are needed to test interventions for particular \n     veteran subgroups who were less likely than others to improve \n     with treatment. (Psychiatric Services 65:1414-1419, 2014; \n     doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201300453)\n       Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most \n     common mental disorders among veterans returning from recent \n     deployments. Yet, despite the availability of evidence-based \n     treatments, there are multiple barriers to initiating mental \n     health treatment. Many military personnel and veterans who \n     report barriers to mental health care do not seek treatment \n     or postpone seeking it.\n       Among veterans who do seek mental health care, the time lag \n     is quite significant. In a previous study, we found that \n     recently returning veterans with psychiatric diagnoses had \n     delayed initiating mental health care at the U.S. Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) by a median of over two years after \n     their last deployment ended. Delays in care can translate \n     into delays in symptom and functional improvement, hindering \n     readjustment to civilian life, family, and community.\n       Some studies have examined predictors of PTSD symptom \n     worsening, but outside of randomized treatment trials, only a \n     few studies have examined variables that are associated with \n     PTSD symptom improvement. In other words, few studies have \n     examined variables that are associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement in a naturalistic fashion, by allowing treatment \n     initiation or engagement to vary among participants. \n     Furthermore, even fewer studies have examined these questions \n     among military personnel or veterans, particularly among \n     those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Existing \n     studies have found a few variables that were associated with \n     PTSD symptom improvement. For example, service members \n     serving in multiple deployments demonstrated greater symptom \n     improvement than those serving in a single deployment. For \n     other demographic variables, the association with improvement \n     is unclear. For example, although we know that female gender \n     may be associated with the development of PTSD, it is not \n     clear how gender is related to PTSD symptom improvement.\n       If we can better understand why some individuals improve, \n     we can better understand the course and trajectories of PTSD \n     and how to best contribute to individuals' recovery. This \n     study evaluated demographic, military, temporal, and logistic \n     variables that may be associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement. We were particularly interested in whether \n     seeking mental health treatment sooner was associated with \n     improvement in PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n                                Methods\n\n     Data source and extraction\n       We conducted a retrospective analysis of existing medical \n     records from the VA's Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/\n     Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation New Dawn (OND) \n     roster, a national database of veterans who have separated \n     from OEF/OIF/OND military service and who have enrolled in VA \n     health care. Veterans of OEF served predominantly in \n     Afghanistan, and veterans of OIF and OND served predominantly \n     in Iraq. We linked the OEF/OIF/OND roster database, which \n     contains veterans' demographic and military service \n     information, to the Decision Support System's National Data \n     Extract of pharmacy data and the VA National Patient Care \n     Database, which provides VA visit dates and associated \n     diagnostic codes from the International Classification of \n     Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). \n     These data are derived from electronic medical records \n     generated during clinical visits. Visits to mental health \n     outpatient and primary care services are categorized by \n     clinic stop codes. Mental health outpatient services include \n     visits to integrated care clinics providing primary care and \n     mental health care. Fee basis codes designate care that is \n     rendered at non-VA facilities and reimbursed by the VA but do \n     not capture all non-VA care, such as care reimbursed by \n     private insurance. The results of PTSD screening were \n     extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.\n       All analyses were restricted to OEF/OIF/OND veterans who \n     had received a diagnosis of PTSD (ICD-9-CM code 309.81) \n     during two or more clinical encounters that occurred after \n     the end of their last deployment and before December 31, \n     2012; had utilized mental health outpatient care between \n     October 1, 2007 (beginning of nationwide primary care \n     screenings), and December 31, 2012, and had not made any \n     prior use of VA care; and had received PTSD screenings at \n     both the start of treatment (up to three months before and \n     one month after the first mental health visit) and on at \n     least one other occasion occurring at least one year later \n     (N=39,690). Of veterans who newly entered mental health \n     treatment, 83% had a baseline screen for PTSD, and of those \n     with a baseline screen, 50% had a follow-up screen during the \n     period beginning one year later. The follow-up screen that \n     was closest in proximity to the one-year follow-up date was \n     utilized.\n     Measures\n       PTSD symptoms were assessed by using the Primary Care PTSD \n     Screen (PC-PTSD), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), or both. Both \n     measures were included in order to capture the most \n     representative sample, given that the PC-PTSD screen is \n     mainly used in VA primary care settings and other non-mental \n     health settings and the PCL is used primarily in VA mental \n     health settings. The PC-PTSD, a brief four-item screen given \n     annually and after each deployment, is designed to detect \n     possible PTSD symptoms. The screen yields binary responses \n     (yes or no) for each of four PTSD symptom clusters: \n     reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and \n     hyperarousal; a score of \u001c3 designates a positive PTSD screen \n     for veterans.\n       The PCL is a 17-item measure, with each item rating the \n     presence of a different symptom over the past month on a 5-\n     point Likert scale, from not at all to a little bit, \n     moderately, quite a bit, and extremely. The PCL has been \n     shown to have very good internal consistency, and it \n     correlates strongly with other measures of PTSD symptoms. The \n     PCL also demonstrates high diagnostic efficiency (.90). \n     Within the VA, the PCL is mainly administered at the \n     discretion of treating clinicians, typically to track patient \n     progress during the course of mental health treatment. For \n     the purposes of this study, symptoms rated as moderately or \n     above on the PCL were considered present. PTSD symptoms from \n     the PCL were combined in order to create indicators that \n     paralleled each of the four symptom cluster proxies from the \n     PC-PTSD. The validity of the mapping of PCL questions onto \n     PC-PTSD items was tested by examining concordance between the \n     two screens given at the VA on the same date. For the \n     purposes of validation, all OEF/OIF/OND veterans who were \n     administered the PCL and the PC-PTSD on the same date (not \n     restricted to our study sample) were included (N=53,756), \n     with a total of 57,889 instances in which a given veteran had \n     both a PC-PTSD and PCL administered on the same day. [A table \n     describing the mapping of the PCL to the PC-PTSD and \n     agreement between the two instruments is available online as \n     a data supplement to this article.]\n       We created a composite variable, referred to as the PTSD \n     screen result; endorsing three or more symptoms on either \n     measure constituted a positive screen for PTSD.\n     Dependent variable\n       The binary dependent variable, a negative (versus positive) \n     PTSD screen result, was defined as a score of <3 at follow-up \n     on the PTSD screen. This outcome comprised PTSD screen \n     results that had improved or had remained negative compared \n     with baseline results (versus having worsened or remained \n     positive).\n     Independent variables\n       The main independent variable was time until initiation of \n     mental health outpatient treatment, which was defined for \n     each person as the time (in years) from the end of the last \n     deployment until the first mental health\n\n[[Page H259]]\n\n     outpatient visit. Other independent variables included date \n     of birth, gender, race-ethnicity, marital status, and \n     military characteristics. Details about each person's \n     military characteristics (armed forces branch [Army, Marines, \n     Navy or Coast Guard, or Air Force], rank, component type \n     [National Guard and reserves or active duty], and number of \n     deployments [one or multiple deployments]) were extracted \n     from the OEF/OIF/OND roster. Information about the type of \n     VA facility nearest to the individual and the distance to \n     the closest facility was derived from the OEF/OIF/OND \n     roster by the VA planning and system support group.\n       The following independent variables were treated as \n     potential confounders because each could account for change \n     in PTSD symptoms: mental health outpatient treatment \n     utilization, defined as the number of mental health clinic \n     visits between the start of mental health treatment and the \n     follow-up screen; regular use of primary care services, \n     defined as a mean interval between visits of six months or \n     fewer; and use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor \n     (SSRI) for 12 consecutive weeks or more, as encoded in VA \n     outpatient pharmacy data.\n     Analysis\n       We used logistic regression analysis to examine the \n     association of independent predictor variables with a \n     negative PTSD screen result. In separate logistic regression \n     models, we examined predictors of PTSD screen results for \n     each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing, \n     avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal). The main \n     predictors of interest included time from the end of the last \n     deployment to initiation of mental health outpatient \n     treatment, gender, age, race-ethnicity, marital status, \n     military component, rank, branch, number of deployments, and \n     distance to and type of nearest VA facility. The multi-\n     variable analysis adjusted for potential confounders of the \n     association between changes in PTSD symptoms and predictors. \n     Potential confounders included baseline PTSD screen result, \n     timing of follow-up screen, regular utilization of primary \n     care services, total mental health outpatient treatment \n     utilization, and SSRI use. Primary care and mental health \n     service utilization and antidepressant use were included only \n     for adjustment purposes because of potential biases due to \n     confounding by indication. More specifically, persons who are \n     more symptomatic are more likely to utilize health services \n     and antidepressant medications.\n       We tested interactions of demographic and military \n     predictors with each other and, separately, with time to \n     initiation of mental health outpatient treatment. As \n     mentioned above, the study combined results for veterans \n     whose PTSD screen result had improved from baseline with \n     those for veterans whose screen result had remained negative. \n     To determine whether it was valid to combine these scores, we \n     tested interactions of baseline screen results with \n     demographic and military factors and, separately, with time \n     from the end of the last deployment to initiation of mental \n     health outpatient treatment. All tests were two-tailed. \n     Analyses were performed by using SAS, version 9.3. The study \n     was approved by the Committee on Human Research, University \n     of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco VA \n     Medical Center.\n\n\n                                RESULTS\n\n       The sample was 90% male, with a mean<plus-minus>SD age of \n     30.5<plus-minus>8.16; 57% were white, 11% were black, 11% \n     were Hispanic, and 21% were of other or unknown race-\n     ethnicity. At the time of initiation of mental health \n     outpatient treatment, 75% of the veterans screened positive \n     for PTSD, having endorsed at least three of the four PTSD \n     symptom clusters on the PTSD screen (Table 1). After at least \n     one year (mean follow-up=2.37<plus-minus>.93 years), 27% \n     (N=7,908) of those with a positive screen at baseline had \n     improved, and 43% (N=4,329) of those with a negative screen \n     at baseline continued to screen negative.\n       Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the \n     following characteristics were associated with a negative \n     PTSD screen result: women compared with men, older versus \n     younger age at first mental health outpatient visit, officer \n     rank compared with enlisted rank, service in branches of the \n     military other than the Army, and negative PTSD screen at \n     baseline (Table 2).\n       Blacks were less likely than whites to have a negative \n     screen result (Table 2), and this difference persisted after \n     adjustment for time from the end of the last deployment to \n     mental health outpatient treatment. Similar to findings of \n     previous studies, the median interval between the end of the \n     last deployment and the use of services was about three \n     months longer for blacks than for whites (p<.001; data not \n     shown). The reduced likelihood among blacks versus whites of \n     a negative PTSD screen result was partly driven by the 7% \n     greater probability that blacks would screen positive for \n     PTSD at follow-up after having screened negative at baseline \n     (p<.001; results not shown).\n       Veterans who were married were slightly less likely than \n     those who were never married to have a negative PTSD screen \n     result. Veterans who lived more than ten miles away from the \n     nearest VA facility were less likely than veterans who lived \n     closer to have a negative screen result. Veterans who lived \n     closer to a community-based outpatient clinic than to a VA \n     medical center were also less likely to have a negative \n     screen result.\n       Notably, veterans who waited longer to initiate mental \n     health outpatient treatment were less likely to have a \n     negative screen result. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing \n     probability of a negative screen result with each year that \n     passed after the end of the last deployment.\n       Logistic regression analyses found similar patterns of \n     association between predictor variables and PTSD screen \n     results for each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (results \n     not shown).\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       A number of demographic, military, temporal, and logistic \n     variables were associated with symptom improvement or with \n     continuing to score below the threshold for a positive PTSD \n     screen. Although temporal variables are rarely examined, we \n     found that greater time to mental health outpatient treatment \n     engagement was negatively associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement. More specifically, veterans who waited longer to \n     get mental health treatment were less likely than veterans \n     who sought treatment sooner to experience PTSD symptom \n     improvement during the study period. This finding sheds light \n     on the importance of continuing to better understand barriers \n     to mental health treatment, particularly given that less than \n     half of veterans with mental health problems seek care and \n     those who seek care do so after significant delays.\n       Outreach efforts to help veterans engage in treatment in a \n     timely manner are critical and may, in turn, help with PTSD \n     symptom improvement over time. Intervening early when mental \n     health problems are first detected should be a priority. \n     Given that integrated primary and mental health care is now \n     becoming available at many VA health care facilities, this \n     ``one-stop shop'' model provides an optimal way to decrease \n     time to seeking mental health care. Veterans in primary \n     care who screen positive for any mental health problems \n     can receive immediate mental health assistance within an \n     integrated care model, which may assist with the stigma of \n     receiving care in a mental health setting. Indeed, \n     veterans who received integrated primary care were more \n     likely to receive a mental health evaluation or care \n     within a month.\n       We also found that female gender was associated with \n     greater PTSD symptom improvement compared with male gender. \n     Although civilian studies found that females are at greater \n     risk of PTSD, findings in military samples have been mixed, \n     with some studies finding no gender differences. In addition, \n     we recently found that although both genders experienced a \n     delay in engaging in minimally adequate mental health care \n     (eight mental health outpatient visits within a year), female \n     veterans received minimally adequate mental health care about \n     two years sooner than male veterans, which may explain why \n     they achieved greater symptom improvement.\n       Black veterans were less likely, but only modestly so, to \n     demonstrate PTSD symptom improvement, compared with their \n     white counterparts, and this difference was not explained by \n     longer time from the end of the last deployment to mental \n     health outpatient treatment initiation. That is not \n     surprising, given that studies have consistently found that \n     unmet treatment needs are greatest in underserved groups, \n     including racial-ethnic minority groups). It may be that \n     veterans from racial-ethnic minority groups face particular \n     barriers to treatment that are important to acknowledge, and \n     more research is needed in this area in order to optimize \n     outcomes. Furthermore, other variables, such as differential \n     rates of traumatic stressors and preexisting conditions, are \n     important to further explore and may explain some of these \n     differences.\n       Officers were more likely than enlisted personnel to \n     experience PTSD symptom improvement. One possible explanation \n     is that officer status may be a proxy for higher education; \n     research has shown that lower levels of education are \n     associated with chronic trajectories of PTSD. However, other \n     variables that we were not able to measure, such as social \n     support in the aftermath of trauma, may also explain some of \n     these findings.\n       A number of limitations should be considered when \n     interpreting these findings. First, this study was conducted \n     with a population of treatment-seeking veterans who had at \n     least one visit to a VA health care facility. Therefore, our \n     results should not be generalized to all OEF/OIF/OND military \n     personnel or veterans. Second, we selected a population of \n     veterans who served in support of OEF/OIF/OND, and, \n     therefore, these results should not be generalized to \n     veterans of other eras or to veterans from other countries. \n     Third, ICD-9-CM diagnoses were acquired from administrative \n     health records and were not verified with standardized \n     diagnostic measures. A related concern is the combined use of \n     two separate validated tools, the PCL and the PC-PTSD. We \n     used both the PCL and the PC-PTSD in order to obtain the most \n     representative sample and because they are the measures used \n     by the VA system. Furthermore, we found that the method we \n     used was statistically reliable. Nonetheless, combining two \n     separate validated tools may have resulted in variations in \n     these data. Future studies should continue to examine the \n     validity and reliability of this method.\n       Fourth, because of the ways in which data appear in the VA \n     administrative database, we were not able to distinguish \n     between the types of mental health treatments that veterans \n     were receiving, such as evidence-based treatment for PTSD or \n     other mental health\n\n[[Page H260]]\n\n     problems versus supportive therapy; rather, we could account \n     only for number of visits. We hope to have better indicators \n     of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in the future so that \n     the particular types of care that veterans receive can be \n     examined more closely in relation to symptom improvement. \n     Fifth, because we used administrative data, we were not able \n     to examine third variables that may be associated with our \n     outcome, including severe avoidance symptoms, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and poor attachment, among others. Finally, we \n     were able to include only veterans whose PTSD symptoms were \n     measured during at least two occasions; those who dropped out \n     after one visit are not as well represented.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Veterans who waited longer to get mental health treatment \n     were less likely to experience PTSD symptom improvement \n     during the study period. Furthermore, improving barriers for \n     black, male, younger, rural, lower-ranking, and possibly less \n     well educated veterans is an important priority, given our \n     findings. Models that integrate primary care and mental \n     health care may be an optimal way to help expedite veteran \n     treatment engagement.\n\n\n                    Acknowledgments and disclosures\n\n       This research was supported by VA Health Services Research \n     and Development Service (HSR&D) Career Development Award (RCD \n     06-042) to Dr. Maguen, an HSR&D Service Directed Research \n     Award (SDR-08-408) to Dr. Seal, and a Department of Defense \n     Mental Health Research Infrastructure Award (W81XWH-11-2-\n     0189) to Dr. Neylan.

A smooth care transition from DOD to VA can help support \nveterans as they adjust to the next phase of their lives and provide \neasy access to healthcare should any challenges arise.\n  Everyday Americans find it difficult and frustrating to sign up for \nhealthcare. Now, imagine that you have just come off Active-Duty \nmilitary service where, for years you were told when and where to show \nup for your healthcare. You probably heard something about VA services \nduring your transition assistance program but, frankly, you were \nfocused on everything you had to do to finalize your separation from \nthe military and possibly looking for new employment and relocating \nyour family.\n  Now, after having separated from the military, you are a veteran, and \nmaybe for the first time you have to figure out how to check your \neligibility for VA healthcare and navigate the system while potentially \nalso facing some new stress in your personal and family life. This is \ncompletely avoidable with EVEST, which simply enrolls you in the VA \nhealthcare for which you are already eligible, ensuring that when you \nneed VA, there aren't any unnecessary roadblocks to seeing a doctor.\n  Now, let me say that again. This legislation has nothing to do with a \nveteran's eligibility, nor does it change VA standards or who is \neligible. It only connects eligible veterans to VA care faster and \neasier.\n  We know that veterans are much more likely to use VA services and \ncare when the process to enroll is simple, and we know that VA care is \nworld class. EVEST is a straightforward tool that will allow us to \nsimplify the transition process and take steps toward preventing \nveteran suicide.\n  Automatic enrollment is something policymakers and veterans service \norganizations and stakeholders have been trying to advance for years, \nand with EVEST it will finally become a reality.\n  Paralyzed Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans have \nformally endorsed this legislation. The Nurses Organization of Veterans \nAffairs, the American Federation of Government Employees, the Veterans \nHealthcare Policy Institute, and the American Psychological Association \nalso support EVEST.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from \nthe Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs and the Veterans Healthcare \nPolicy Institute.\n                                            Nurses Organization of\n\n\n                                             Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                                 January 14, 2021.\n     Chairman Mark Takano,\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Takano: On behalf of the nearly 3,000 members \n     of the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA) we \n     would like to offer our strong support for your bill, H.R. \n     4673, Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST).\n       As nurses, caring for Veterans is our number one priority. \n     Your bill will provide Veterans with the option of enrolling \n     in VA healthcare during the critical months following their \n     transition to civilian life and ensure servicemembers \n     separating from active duty receive the critical health care \n     to which they are eligible.\n       Your bill will also help eliminate barriers to care--\n     including those who may not know they are even eligible to \n     receive care at VA. It will also help to assure the Veteran \n     that they are not alone in seeking care for any physical or \n     mental health condition acquired during their military \n     service.\n       Offering automatic enrollment with an opt out will help to \n     lessen the burden of navigating the VA healthcare system at a \n     time when they are dealing with many challenges as they \n     transition to civilian life.\n       NOVA believes that most Veterans will find care provided \n     them within the VA is suited to their individual and complex \n     needs and cannot be matched in the private sector. Many \n     providers at the VA are Veterans themselves so they \n     understand what it means to serve and are trained to provide \n     a Whole Health approach to the Veteran patients' health and \n     well-being.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue and your \n     continued support for Veterans and the healthcare \n     professionals who care for them.\n           Sincerely,\n     Taryn-Janae Wilcox-Olson, MHS, RN,\n       President, Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA).\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Veterans Healthcare\n\n\n                                      Policy Institute (VHPI),\n\n                                                 January 19, 2022.\n     Endorsement of the ``Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition \n         Act''\n       The Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute (VHPI) is pleased \n     to formally endorse House bill H.R. 4673, the ``Ensuring \n     Veterans' Smooth Transition Act'' or ``EVEST Act.'' The EVEST \n     Act creates a process to automatically enroll Veterans who \n     are eligible, upon their discharge from the military, into \n     the VA for medical care, with an opportunity to opt out. Many \n     Veterans do not receive the health care they have earned \n     through their service because they are unaware of their \n     eligibility or are too overwhelmed during the complex period \n     of transitioning from active duty. By automatically enrolling \n     Veterans into the VA system, many more eligible veterans will \n     be able to utilize valuable VA health care benefits. Many \n     lives will be saved.\n       This is one of the most important bills in many years, and \n     we are pleased to support its passage.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader \nHoyer for considering this legislation today, and I urge the rest of my \ncolleagues to support this vital legislation to increase access to care \nand ensure a smooth transition to civilian life for veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4673, the Ensuring \nVeterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.\n  This bill would require VA to automatically enroll every eligible \nseparating servicemember into the VA healthcare system. As a veteran, I \nknow firsthand that the transition from military to civilian life can \nbe hard. One of the goals is to remove barriers to care for veterans, \nwhether they left the military decades ago or just last week.\n  I believe the intention of the EVEST Act is to further that goal by \nconnecting more at-risk servicemembers with the VA as they leave the \nservice. I support the intention. I know many other Members do as well, \nwhich is why I expect the bill to pass the House, and probably on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  However, as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nhave a different perspective on this bill than many of my colleagues. I \nhave taken a long, hard look at this legislation, and what I have seen \nis a bill that may be well intended but has several potential problems.\n  To start with, the EVEST Act enrolls separating servicemembers into \nthe VA healthcare system without their knowledge or consent. Only after \nthey have been enrolled does the bill require VA to inform the veterans \nof their enrollment, the status of their enrollment, and how to opt out \nby disenrolling themselves.\n  We shouldn't be signing veterans up for a government program they \naren't asking for and may never need without at least letting them know \nfirst. And\n\n[[Page H261]]\n\nwe shouldn't be telling them that if they don't like it, they can \nfigure out how to disenroll themselves. That is backwards.\n  Veterans deserve better than that. Veterans also deserve better than \na bill that has been rushed through Congress without due diligence. \nThere has never been a single hearing on the EVEST Act in this \nCongress.\n  You may hear the chairman say that there has been a hearing on this \nbill last Congress. That is true. But last Congress and this Congress \nare very different. We had a different administration last Congress; we \nhad a different VA Secretary last Congress. I believe more than 70 \nMembers are new this Congress. More than half of the membership of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee is new as well. And, regardless, VA did not \nprovide testimony at the hearing last Congress.\n  We have no idea if VA can implement the bill without disrupting \nservice to the veterans already in the VA health system, further \nburdening VA's already overworked staff, or increasing the strain on \nVA's already overfull facilities. Every Member of the House hears from \nveterans in our districts who are waiting too long for care they need, \nstuck in crowded VA facilities, and being treated by VA staff who are \nstruggling and overwhelmed. I am concerned that this bill could make \neach of those things worse.\n  I am not the only one who thinks so. Last week, right before this \nbill was considered by the Rules Committee, the Biden administration \nissued a Statement of Administration Policy on the EVEST Act. The \nstatement reads, ``There may be challenges implementing this bill as \ndrafted, and the administration looks forward to working with Congress. \n. . .'' In other words, even the President recognizes that this bill \nneeds more work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nH.R. 1836--Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021--Rep. Levin, D-\n                    California, and nine cosponsors\n\n   H.R. 4673--Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition (EVEST) Act--Rep. \n                          Takano, D-California\n\n       The Biden-Harris Administration supports efforts that \n     ensure veterans receive timely access to high-quality \n     benefits and services that they have earned.\n       The Administration supports H.R. 1836, which would expand \n     eligibility criteria for certain education benefits. Current \n     law defines the term ``active duty'' as those individuals who \n     are on full-time duty in the active military service of the \n     United States, including full-time training duty, annual \n     training duty, and attendance, while in the active military \n     service, at a school designated as a service school by law or \n     by the Secretary of the military department concerned. H.R. \n     1836 would expand eligibility criteria to include those \n     training in full-time National Guard duty, which includes the \n     National Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air National \n     Guard, as well as those same members when performing active \n     duty.\n       The Administration supports the EVEST Act's goal of \n     seamless enrollment in health care coverage. As currently \n     written, H.R. 4673 would require the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll new veterans into VA \n     health care, and notify veterans of their enrollment and \n     instructions on how to un-enroll, if desired. There may be \n     challenges implementing this bill as drafted, and the \n     Administration looks forward to working with Congress on how \n     best to operationalize its objective.\n\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, to be clear, the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nhad numerous opportunities in the last year to do that work that I had \njust discussed, and I don't know why the chairman chose not to. I have \nheard him say over the last week that it is okay we didn't have a \nhearing on the EVEST Act in this Congress because the bill has been in \nthe public domain.\n  Now, I am not sure what that statement really means because there \nhave been almost 400 bills introduced in this Congress that have been \nreferred to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I guess that each of those \nare in the public domain. But I don't think any of them are ready for a \nvote here on the House floor.\n  It is not too much to ask that we seek the input from stakeholders \nbefore voting on a bill to become law. That is actually the least we \ncan do. I don't think our constituents sent us here to do anything less \nthan that.\n  During last week's Rules Committee, Congresswoman Torres, a member of \nChairman Takano's own party, seemed to agree with me by lamenting the \nlack of process this bill has received this Congress. With all due \nrespect to the Congresswoman, I doubt that we agree on much, but we do \nagree on this, though. Having this bill go through a much more robust \nprocess this Congress could have resulted in a much better product for \nour veterans.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Finally, I want to note that the bill will also cost taxpayers $3.1 \nbillion in new discretionary spending. Not a penny of that $3.1 billion \nis offset.\n  Implementing this bill will certainly require additional funding \nabove the nearly $100 billion already appropriated for the VA \nhealthcare system.\n  We cannot keep saddling our children and grandchildren with billions \nof dollars more debt. We have to do better than this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that I understand why my colleagues will \nlikely vote for this bill. I wish I could vote for this bill, as well.\n  Leaving the military was not easy. It can leave new veterans feeling \nadrift and alone. I have been there. But that is why I supported \nefforts during the Trump administration to improve the Transition \nAssistance Program and increase the VA's outreach to separating \nservicemembers during their first year out of uniform.\n  I want separating servicemembers who need additional support to be \nable to get it and the help they need in a seamless manner. And I am \nnot at all confident that this bill will accomplish that goal without \nharming services to other veterans and adding to the national debt. As \na result, I must oppose this bill today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I reiterate that we should not be hiding the care that our veterans \nhave earned. Let me quickly say that this bill has been in the public \ndomain for 2 years. It was reintroduced last summer, and the minority \nhad over 6 months to talk with us and the VA about it.\n  Furthermore, the committee has held six hearings on suicide \nprevention and transition since 2019. The common sense of this bill \nshines through.\n  And let me also add that regarding the capacity of VA--and I am glad \nthat the ranking member has entered the statement of administrative \nsupport into the Record; that statement clearly says and declares the \nadministration's support and its willingness to work with the \nadministration.\n  Data shows that VA enrollment has been going down in recent years, \nand while new enrollment hovers around 400,000 per year, it used to be \ndouble that, around one million per year, and using current \nassumptions, VA projects veteran enrollment in VHA to remain relatively \nsteady from 2019 to 2029.\n  I am very confident about VA's ability to absorb the additional \nveterans that will take advantage of VA's world-class healthcare.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nMrvan), my good friend and a member of the House Committee on Veterans \nAffairs and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology \nModernization.\n  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for yielding me the time.\n  It is my honor today to rise in support of H.R. 4673, the Ensuring \nVeterans' Smooth Transition Act.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Takano to advance this \ncritical legislation that will require the VA to automatically enroll \nindividuals who are separating from the military into the VA system.\n  Our brave members of the military put their lives and health on the \nline every day to keep our Nation safe, defend our democracy, and \nprotect our freedoms.\n  We have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible for them to \ntransition from military service to civilian life, and I am pleased \nthat this legislation does just that.\n  My life experiences have afforded me the opportunity as a former \ntownship trustee in northwest Indiana to work every day with the \nveterans community. I was able to initiate a veterans services \nroundtable and bring together veteran organizations to discuss, \ncoordinate, and streamline much-needed resources to our veterans.\n\n[[Page H262]]\n\n  In many instances, it was not that the resources or the benefit was \nunavailable, but rather, the individual was unaware of the existing \nbenefit, or unable to access, for whatever reason, the very resource \nthey needed.\n  Today, I am thinking of those countless discussions and individuals \nas I will vote to support the EVEST Act. It is an effective proposal to \nhelp ensure that veterans access the valuable healthcare services \navailable to them during this transition process from active to veteran \nstatus.\n  Today, I want to make sure we meet our veterans' mental health needs \nand increase veterans' access to healthcare. I again thank Chairman \nTakano and my fellow members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nyour commitment to supporting veterans and bringing this measure to the \nfloor today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In response to the EVEST Act has been in the public domain, I think \nit is very important to note, as I mentioned earlier, the last Congress \nis not the same as this Congress. We have more than 70 Members who are \nnew Members of Congress, half of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is \nnew, we have a different President, and we have a different secretary.\n  Introducing a bill is not the same as conducting a hearing. You can't \nget input from the stakeholders. You can't engage in meaningful debate \nin the public domain. This reflects zero input from the VA, meaning we \nhave no idea whether it is flexible, whether it is workable, whether it \nis disruptive to the VA system. We don't know.\n  And even the Biden administration agrees that more work is needed \nbefore this bill should become law.\n  And the previous speaker, Mr. Speaker, spoke about the person that \ndidn't know what was available to them through the VA. If you were my \nage as a veteran it is true that you could not know because you got a \nquick class and the TAP program. And I have mentioned on this floor \nbefore that that is a tap on the back and see you later.\n  But today's TAP program is a course that you take, and you are bound \nto understand separation from your active service and what VA benefits \nare available to you.\n  And not only that, the Trump administration in 2018 put an \nadministrative order out that you are then contacted after separation \nat 90, 180, and 360 days out to be notified of what benefits are \navailable to you in the VA. We are doing that.\n  This instead enrolls members without their consent, and then they are \nenrolled. And the only option they have is to be notified later how \nmaybe they can get out of being enrolled.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to add that, in response to the esteemed ranking member, VA \nformally supports this legislation and has been discussing auto \nenrollment for years.\n  VA has already been working to make transition into VA healthcare \nsmoother with Solid Start and will soon have data showing that warm \nhandoffs have a positive impact on veteran outcomes without \noverwhelming the VA system.\n  In response to the criticism that VSOs have not had input, I want to \npoint out that VSOs, including Paralyzed Veterans of America and \nDisabled American Veterans, have already formally endorsed EVEST. Why? \nBecause the common sense of this legislation shines through.\n  All VSOs have had a chance to weigh in, and many did. The Nurses \nOrganization of Veterans Affairs, the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, the Veterans Health Policy Institute, and the American \nPsychological Association also support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCorrea), my good friend and a former member of the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee who now serves on the Agriculture Committee, Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the EVEST \nAct.\n  All gave some, and many made the ultimate sacrifice. America has made \na promise to our veterans that we will take care of them when they \nreturn home.\n  I represent Orange County, California, and many of my constituents \nhave served their country proudly. One of my constituents, Billy Hall, \nfrom the city of Orange, enlisted at the age of 15, served from 1941 to \n1945 in World War II, and again from 1948 to 1967 in the Korean and \nVietnam wars.\n  Every servicemember deserves our respect and gratitude, and most of \nall, all the benefits and care that we promised them when they would \nreturn home.\n  This bill is very simple but very important. It automatically enrolls \nveterans in the healthcare system. It provides veterans healthcare \nwithout the red tape.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the EVEST Act and pass this \nsimple and important commonsense legislation for our veterans.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In my debate and the things that I brought up here today, I never \nsaid that VSOs didn't have input. I did say the VA did not come to the \ncommittee, and we did not have the proper hearings. If the VA is in \nsupport of this bill, I would request that the VA send the \ndocumentation saying how they are in support of this bill. Their input \nwould be vitally important.\n  Whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration, the VA is \nvitally important to make sure they provide services to our \nconstituents and to our veterans.\n  No one on this floor cares more about veterans than the people who \nserve on this committee--I can guarantee you that--whether it is the \nchairman or myself.\n  But we have to make sure what we are providing does what it is we are \ntrying to do. It was mentioned earlier that they believe that this \nwould help reduce suicide among transitioning servicemembers. I care \ndeeply about this. This is something that both I and the chairman have \nworked on and will continue to work on.\n  The majority of veterans who die of suicide have not had meaningful \nengagement with the VA. They may have been enrolled in the VA, but they \nhaven't gotten the VA care that they need.\n  This bill would add names of eligible separating servicemembers from \nthe VA and put them on the rolls, but it doesn't do the outreach that \nis necessary to possibly prevent them from that ultimate decision to \nend their lives.\n  Those are the type of things we are working on and will continue to \nwork on. This is not the answer to that. There are a lot of other \nconcerns that I have expressed and will continue to express.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me say that the amendments that we are considering to this bill \ntoday, which I consider friendly, will address many of the ranking \nmember's concerns about the reaching out.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), my \ngood friend who serves on the Financial Services Committee and the \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for moving this very \nimportant legislation.\n  In this polarized and angry time, one of the lights of this \ninstitution is that we have always come together to better serve our \nveterans, to better serve those men and women who took the ultimate \nrisk and were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of all \nof us and the system that this room embodies.\n  And this is a real problem. As I go around my district and I talk to \nyoung veterans, they face any number of transitional issues; with \nhousing, with healthcare. And let's face it, the change from being on \nactive duty to being a veteran is a challenging one, one that all too \noften results in the kind of tragedy that we have acknowledged here in \nthis Chamber today.\n\n[[Page H263]]\n\n  And so I rise in strong support of the EVEST Act. It is consistent \nwith something that I am very proud to have accomplished many years ago \nwhen we passed the SERVE Act, which made it easier for veterans to show \nthat they had an income so that they could get the housing which they \nwere entitled to. It was a small thing, but it just eased the passage \nfor those young men and women who have so well served this country.\n  This is important, and it is not a big deal, but it is going to \naffect tens of thousands of veterans. My Republican friends know that I \nrespect and value their input and their objections to our ideas. It \nmakes us better when you pose objections to our ideas. But I am a \nlittle puzzled by the objections that I am hearing today.\n  I have heard sitting here that this is not paid for. Okay. It is $3 \nbillion that I think is well spent on perhaps the most valuable \npopulation that we have. But the notion that it is not paid for, let's \nremember it was just a couple years ago that my friends on the \nRepublican side passed $2 trillion in tax cuts, 83 percent of which \nbenefited the top 1 percent of this country's citizens. I have to \nbelieve that if we can do $2 trillion in tax cuts that largely benefits \nthe richest Americans, that we can find $3 billion to ease the passage \nfor our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I have heard the ranking member say that the VA maybe can't handle \nit. Let's remember that the VA supports this idea and that we are just \nasking them to do a little bit more of what they already do. This is \nnot some new and fanciful program. No, it is making a program that is \nwell-established available to more.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I am particularly proud of my \nfriend and neighbor--  Joe Courtney will talk about this shortly--that \nmy neighbor, Jahana Hayes, is proposing an amendment that will increase \nthe notification that goes to veterans about what is available to them.\n  This bill needs to pass because, at the end of the day, we are \nanswering the question: Do we want more veterans to have access to what \nwe have promised them, or do we want fewer veterans to have access to \nwhat we have promised them? That is what is at stake here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and urge him to rethink his \nobjections to this bill because this will be a proud moment when this \nbill passes.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs did \nnot do our job on this bill. We did not consider this bill in a \nlegislative hearing. We did not seek input from stakeholders or the VA. \nWe did not make certain that automatically enrolling newly separated \nservicemembers into the VA healthcare system would not impede access \nfor existing employees or cause funding crises. And those things are \nvery, very real.\n  Even the Biden OMB has admitted that there are going to be challenges \nwith implementing this bill. If you look at the numbers--and I am going \nto add this into what should be mentioned--19.1 million veterans is \nwhat we have; 9 million veterans are enrolled; 7 million have used \naccess to the VA. If we start and do it this way without letting \nveterans make decisions on their own, it can overwhelm the VA. That is \nwhat has been mentioned by OMB.\n  Veterans are already facing tough challenges. So is the VA health \nsystem that they can go to. But we don't need to add any more to their \nplates without at least hearing how it is going to affect the services \nthat are already being provided to our veterans.\n  That is why, just so you know, I am offering a motion to recommit \nthis morning. My motion to recommit, if adopted, would send this bill \nback to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to consider an amendment to \nH.R. 4673 that would delay implementation until 30 days after the VA \nhas certified that it can implement, without disruption, services to \nveterans or requiring additional funds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't see how those who support this bill, despite its \nproblems and the Biden administration's recognition that it may cause \nchallenges, can object to this amendment. The very least we can do for \nthe millions of veterans who are already enrolled in VA care and \ncounting on VA services is to ensure--before this bill goes into \neffect--that it won't cause undue harm to them. I have already drafted \nan amendment that would accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my motion to \nrecommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in response to my friend, the esteemed \nranking member, that his MTR, which would delay implementation in order \nto avoid harm to our veterans, dare I say that the harm is in the \ndelay.\n  I am reminded of a quote from the VFW's Pat Murray that we had at \nyesterday's roundtable on toxic exposure: Our pay-for for this bill and \nour pay-for, frankly, for all that we do for veterans was the ticket \nthat we sent servicemembers overseas to serve. I repeat: Our pay-for \nwas the ticket we sent servicemembers overseas to serve.\n  And a little further discussion on the pay-for issue: The \nCongressional Budget Office does not estimate that this bill will \nincrease mandatory spending and does not require an offset. These are \nthe rules we play by.\n  Again, we are not creating new eligibility here. The only cost of \nthis bill is veterans seeking care that they are already eligible for. \nWe are all better off when veterans are seeking the care that they \nneed, and we should not be hiding that care for which they are \neligible.\n  Automatic enrollment in VA healthcare for eligible veterans is a \nlong-needed suicide prevention tool. We cannot put a price tag on \nprotecting the health and safety of our veterans. Many of these \nveterans would go on to use VA healthcare even if they are not \nautomatically enrolled, and the minority does not give a compelling \nreason why we should hinder or make that process more difficult for our \nveterans.\n  Again, I repeat, we should not be hiding the care for which our \nveterans are already eligible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in passing H.R. \n4673, as amended, and I anticipate we will see a big bipartisan vote \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R. \n1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST), which \nprovides automatic enrollment in the VA for all transitioning service \nmembers, and veterans who don't want to obtain its services have the \neasy choice of opting out.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  January 20, 2022, on page H263, in the third column, the \nfollowing appeared: Mrs JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in \nstrong support of H.R. 1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth \nTransition Act\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: Ms. JACKSON LEE. \nMr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R. 1836, the \nEnsuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n  Specifically, this bill would:\n  Automatically enroll new veterans into VA Health Care;\n  Provide VA with information about transitioning service members;\n  Require the VA to reach out to veterans about the scope of, and \naccess to, benefits.\n  Assuring future cohorts of veterans--including those struggling with \nthe Taliban triumph in Afghanistan--don't go without health care during \ntheir transition from military to civilian life is the worthy goal of \nthis bill.\n  After attempting suicide while serving on active duty in Iraq, \nKristofer Goldsmith was given a general discharge by the Army and \nlittle else.\n  The overwhelmed 21-year-old returned to his hometown on Long Island, \nN.Y., totally unaware that he was eligible for care from the Veterans \nHealth Administration (VA).\n  ``I had just lost my income, my support network, my identity, and \nalmost my life. I was in a total mental health crisis,'' Goldsmith \nsaid.\n  During the critical months following his transition to civilian life, \nhe went without desperately needed services.\n  If his mother hadn't forced him to go to the VA, Goldsmith, who \ncredits the VA with helping him rebuild his life, doesn't know what \nwould have happened to him.\n  Of this, however, he is certain, ``If I had heard from my local VA \ninforming me of what benefits I had and that I'd been enrolled in the \nsystem, it would have changed my life drastically.''\n  This bill would help thousands of veterans who need services for the \nmultitude of conditions acquired or exacerbated by military service but \nare confused about how to access them.\n\n[[Page H264]]\n\n  These ailments include everything from respiratory problems caused by \nburn-pit toxic exposure to signature combat conditions such as \nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n  For all these problems, prompt attention means everything.\n  For example, according to research conducted by the VA, veterans who \nreceived care soon after the end of their service ``had lower levels of \nPTSD upon follow-up a year after they initiated care.\n  According to the study, for each year that a veteran waited to \ninitiate treatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of \ntheir PTSD either not improving or worsening.\n  In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine \nfound that post-9/11 veterans who had not sought VA mental health care \ndidn't know how to apply for benefits--or were unsure whether they were \neven eligible.\n  Some didn't know what services the VA offered or felt that they \ndidn't deserve care even if they could get it.\n  Some women veterans are similarly unsure whether VA services are even \navailable to their gender.\n  This legislation will not only be key to eliminating these barriers \nbut also to reducing the veteran suicide crisis.\n  A disproportionate number of veterans die by suicide during the \ninitial months and years following separation from military service.\n  Veterans ages 18 to 34 have the highest rate of suicide.\n  Automatic pre-enrollment could be lifesaving during a crisis when \nspeed is of the essence.\n  Smoother access to VA health care has never been more important than \nit is today.\n  The tumultuous end of the war in Afghanistan is intensifying mental \nhealth symptoms within the veteran population.\n  I am proud to support this legislation in order to better serve \nveterans and reduce veteran suicide.\n  This bill, in which we further the benefits and recognition that our \nservicemen and women deserve, also reminds us that we have an \noverriding duty to protect the health and dignity of those serving \ntoday.\n  For this reason, I would like to discuss the crisis that our National \nGuardsmen and Guardswomen have been thrust into at the Texas Governor's \ndirection on our Southern Border.\n  In March 2021, the Texas Governor launched the ill-fated and \nineffective Operation Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to stem \na so-called invasion of migrants at Texas' southern border.\n  As of November 2021, more than 10,000 Texas National Guardsmen have \nbeen deployed to the southern border in pursuit of this folly.\n  According to published media accounts, National Guard members who \nhave been activated for Operation Lone Star are experiencing habitual \npay delays and poor working conditions during the border mission, \nincluding being exposed to COVID-19, and many are missing the equipment \nnecessary for safety and mission success.\n  In addition, the National Guard has faced austere conditions and \nlimited resources, leading to unsanitary conditions such as the lack of \nportable restrooms.\n  Rather than addressing these conditions, just last week the Texas \nGovernor filed a frivolous lawsuit in federal court challenging the \nauthority of President Biden, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed \nForces to require that members of the National Guard be vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19.\n  There is no merit to this nuisance law suit as demonstrated by the \nsummary rejection of similar arguments raised by neighboring Oklahoma \nGovernor Stitt.\n  The Texas Governor's failure to comply with the policies intended to \nreduce the spread of COVID-19 among the Armed Forces will mean that \nthere will be less military personnel available national disasters that \nhave struck Texas in recent years, such as the winter freeze of last \nyear.\n  This will also mean that there are fewer personnel to respond to any \nattacks on the homeland.\n  Encouraged by the Texas Governor's obstinacy, about 40% of the \nmembers of the Texas Army National Guard are refusing to get \nvaccinated, which puts at risk their colleagues and the persons they \nare sworn to defend and protect.\n  National Guardsmen and Guardswomen deployed in this disastrous \nmission at the Texas Governor's insistence face the deadly spread of \nCOVID-19, unsanitary conditions, lack of pay, and a lack of a certain \nfuture.\n  These uniformed men and women deserve better, and some of them, \nseeing no alternative to their present reality, have decided to end it \nall.\n  Five National guard soldiers have shot and killed themselves in the \npast three months, and one more survived a suicide attempt.\n  One of these men, private first class Joshua R. Cortez, was preparing \nto accept a ``lifetime job'' with one of the nation's biggest health \ninsurance companies in late October last year, but the Texas National \nGuard had other ideas.\n  Operation Lone Star required involuntary activations to meet the \nTexas Governor's troop quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers \ntapped to go on state active duty orders--with no idea how long the \nmission would last.\n  In November, the 21-year-old mechanic requested a hardship release \nfrom the mission: ``I've been waiting for this job and I'm on my way to \ngetting hired . . . I missed my first opportunity in September when I \nhad to go on the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not miss this \nopportunity because it is my last opportunity for this lifetime job.''\n  Cortez's company commander recommended approval. But his battalion \ncommander and brigade commander disapproved.\n  Within 36 hours of his request being denied, Cortez drove to a \nparking lot in northwest San Antonio and shot himself in the head.\n  Three other soldiers tied to Operation lone Star have died by \nsuicide, including:\n  Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He \nwas a member of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion's headquarters \ncompany.\n  1st Sgt. John ``Kenny'' Crutcher died Nov. 12, as time ran out on his \ntemporary hardship waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 3rd \nBattalion, 144th Infantry.\n  1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in Crutcher's company, \ndied at home overnight Dec. 17 while on pass.\n  The string of suicides raises urgent questions about the mission's \nconditions and purpose, as well as the way it's organized and manned \nthrough indefinite involuntary call-ups.\n  This is an excellent and common-sense bill that will enhance the \nbenefits of our servicemen and women.\n  We must also act to ensure that our servicemen and women are \nprotected from COVID-19, both for their own safety and the safety of \nour nation.\n  Although we cannot bring back the lives lost due to the Texas \nGovernor's misguided actions, we can remember the names of those we \nhave lost and work to ensure that we treat all members of our military \nequally and with dignity and respect.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Bost) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of these en bloc \namendments. Seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and care \nthey earned through their service is paramount to the transition \nprocess.\n  The Delgado amendment No. 1 makes sure that VA can easily notify \nveterans regarding care and services through mass texting. As \ntechnology and communication methods improve, so should how VA uses \nthose capabilities to easily inform veterans of their benefits. Texting \neligible veterans to tell them they have been auto-enrolled in VA \nhealthcare is an effective, simple way to increase awareness of the \ncare available to them.\n  The Delgado amendment No. 2 requires GAO to submit a report to \ndetermine the best methods to notify veterans regarding their automatic \nenrollment in VA healthcare. This amendment will strengthen the \nunderlying bill and inform best practices for how VA can ensure \nveterans have the information they need regarding their access to care \nand services.\n  Getting information to veterans in an effective manner is crucial to \ntheir transition into civilian life, and the Delgado amendment No. 2 \nwill help improve how VA communicates an eligible veteran's enrollment \nin VA healthcare so they can easily access the care they need.\n  The Hayes amendment requires that VA notify veterans who opt out of \nautomatic enrollment that they may elect to enroll at a later date. We \nunderstand there will be some veterans who opt out for auto-enrollment \nfor a variety of reasons, but it is our duty that they know that the VA \nwill be waiting for them if their future needs change.\n  Ensuring VA adopts and scales best practices related to auto-\nenrollment while also learning from any issues that arise during its \nrollout is important to the long-term effectiveness of the aims of H.R. \n4673.\n  The Tlaib amendment requires the VA to submit a report a year after \nthe first veteran is auto-enrolled in VA healthcare to preserve lessons \nlearned from the rollout. This report will help improve auto-enrollment \nfor both the VA administrators implementing the program and veteran \nusers alike.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendments, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the four en bloc amendments are offered by Congressman \nDelgado, Congresswoman Hayes, and Congresswoman Tlaib. I thank them for \ntheir work. I remain opposed to the underlying bill, and I explained \nwhy in detail over the last debate.\n  One of the reasons I was opposed to it is because the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs did not do our job before bringing this bill to the \nfloor. We did not hold hearings on the bill or seek input from \nstakeholders. And importantly, we did not get assurance from the VA \nthat the bill could be implemented without negative impact to services.\n  In fact, shortly before this bill hit the Rules Committee, the Biden \nadministration did release the statement that we talked about earlier. \nThat statement, remember, says that there are challenges in \nimplementing this bill.\n  Now, I wish we could have done that work in the VA Committee before \nconsidering the bill on the floor. If there are challenges, we need to \nknow about them, and we need to be able to address them to make sure \nthat no veteran is harmed by this bill.\n  Nevertheless, here we are. These en bloc amendments will help get \nsome of the information we should have gotten before passing the bill. \nThey will help us stay informed on how the bill is working and the \nimpact it is having on veterans and on the VA healthcare system after \nthe fact.\n  For example, one of Congressman Delgado's amendments would require \nGAO to study the best methods for VA to notify newly separated \nservicemembers of their enrollment status. His second amendment would \nrequire VA to consider texting newly separated servicemembers to inform \nthem of their enrollment status and their ability to disenroll. If a \nveteran chooses to disenroll, Congresswoman Hayes' amendment would \nrequire VA to provide them with information on how to enroll at a later \ndate if they change their mind down the line.\n  Finally, Congresswoman Tlaib's amendment would require VA to report \nto Congress on the implementation of this bill not later than 1 year \nafter enactment. That would allow us to course-correct, as needed, if \nthe bill is causing problems at least 1 year out.\n  Now, I feel like a broken record, but this is information we should \nhave had already. Nevertheless, it is better late than never. That is \nwhy I will be in support of that amendment alongside the amendments for \nDelgado and Hayes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney), my good friend who serves on the House \nCommittee on Armed Services as chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower \nand Projection Forces and the Committee on Education and Labor.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano and Ranking Member Bost \nfor supporting the en bloc.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to speak on behalf of the Hayes \namendment offered by my friend and neighbor from Connecticut, \nCongresswoman Jahana Hayes, who unfortunately could not be here today \nbecause she is\n\n[[Page H266]]\n\nquarantining. Her amendment is a commonsense proposal to improve an \nalready outstanding bill that will connect more veterans to benefits \nthey have earned by volunteering to wear the uniform of this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, last year, at the outset of the VA's highly successful \nCOVID vaccination program, Congresswoman Hayes and I both toured the VA \nhospital in West Haven, Connecticut, which is the flagship of our VA \nhealthcare system. I had a chance to personally observe her authentic, \nwell-informed advocacy for veteran patients and their family members, \nasking questions about ways Congress can improve the system, \nparticularly about communicating the full extent of their benefits.\n  She described casework from the veterans seeking care, about the \nburdens they faced when navigating a complicated system where not only \nveterans, but family members struggle to stay current with changing \nrules and programs. It is particularly troublesome to hear cases of \nveterans who lose eligibility for help because of late claims caused by \npoor communication, oftentimes at the time of discharge from military \nservice.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why it is so important for the House to pass the \nEVEST Act which will provide automatic enrollment in the VA system for \nall transitioning servicemembers.\n  Mrs. Hayes' friendly amendment wisely requires the VA to go the extra \nmile and inform veterans who opt out of automatic enrollment through \nmultiple methods, including not only email but also paper mail, that \nthey can reenroll as they transition out of the military. Her measure \nis a commonsense insurance that veterans are informed of the EVEST so \nthat they know from day one all of the options and rights that they \nhave to get help.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Chair Takano and Ranking Member \nBost.\n  And I will close by simply noting that my district in eastern \nConnecticut is home to the largest military installation in New \nEngland, with 9,000 sailors and officers who work every day to protect \nour Nation. The transition from military to civilian life happens on a \nrolling, nonstop basis. Too often we work with veterans who experience \ngaps in benefits caused by a failure to enroll or late enrollment, \nwhich this excellent bill will fix.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Hayes \namendment in the en bloc and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), my good friend and author of this amendment. \nShe serves on the Financial Services Committee, the Natural Resources \nCommittee and the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and the committee \nstaff for working with me on this important amendment and for their \nleadership on this bill. I can't thank him enough and look forward to \nhim one day coming to my district for a visit to our VA hospital that \nwe love and cherish.\n  Mr. Speaker, the transition of being on Active Duty to being a \nveteran is not easy. The EVEST Act helps with that transition and makes \nlife easier for those who served our Nation.\n  This act is also a great opportunity to review the automatic \nenrollment programs and learn what works and what doesn't, because \nensuring effective implementation is critical to its success.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a social worker at heart, and we have to ensure \nthat our veterans' lives are changing for the better with this bill. My \namendment ensures the lessons learned during implementation of the \nprogram are preserved for other agencies, as well as to learn, again, \nwhat to do and what not to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the committee for working with me on this \nand look forward to my colleagues' support of this amendment. I also \nlook forward to working with the committee on a number of other issues \nimpacting our veterans, especially veteran suicide and access to mental \nhealth services.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Green), my good friend and member of the Financial Services \nCommittee where he is chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations.\n  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, by way of further introduction, I am \nthe same Al Green who lives across the street from the DeBakey VA \nhospital; the same Al Green who fought in this Congress to secure a \nCongressional Gold Medal for Dr. Michael E. DeBakey; the same Al Green \nwho has 800 flags outside of his office presently to be distributed \nover at the DeBakey VA hospital; the same Al Green that goes there \nannually and speaks to veterans, who talks to them about their needs on \nan annual basis; the same Al Green who has had veterans who tell me the \ndifficulties associated with enrollment; the same Al Green who has \nveterans who say they are so pleased that somebody would come by to be \nof service to them.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Al Green announces here and now that I will support \nthe underlying bill. I support it because it is necessary. I support it \nbecause I believe the veterans that I have spoken to will support it. \nThey need it, and they will enjoy knowing that we came to this floor to \nbring this to fruition.\n  Mr. Speaker, finally, if the VA hospital is not properly funded and \nthis creates some funding issues, I am prepared to vote to fund the VA \nhospital sufficiently so that our veterans can be taken care of. Anyone \nwho is willing to go to a distant place, who may not return the same \nway they left, who may have issues for the rest of their lives, and \nthey do it because they want to protect this country, I am going to do \nall that I can to protect them. This is the least a grateful Nation can \ndo.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to \nclose. I ask all my colleagues to support me in supporting these four \namendments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \nprevious question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The question is on the amendments en bloc.\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 offered by Ms. Escobar\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. \n3 printed in part B of House Report 117-225.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 12, insert after ``a veteran'' the following: \n     ``who is discharged or separated from the Armed Forces on or \n     after the date that is 90 days before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his continued, strong, \nunwavering leadership on behalf of our veterans.\n  I am proud to represent a district that is home to a strong and \ngrowing veteran community, and proud to represent Fort Bliss in \nCongress, where thousands of our servicemembers transition to civilian \nlife.\n  One of my top priorities in Congress has been to protect our veterans \nand their families in the same way they have served and defended our \ncountry. Today, I am honored to stand in support of this critical \nlegislation for our Nation's veterans and to present my amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4673, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act, \nprovides automatic enrollment in the VA for all transitioning \nservicemembers. This bill is vital in that it expedites\n\n[[Page H267]]\n\nthe use of healthcare benefits that veterans have already earned. My \namendment seeks to ensure that servicemembers who were discharged up to \n90 days before the enactment of this legislation can also reap its \nbenefits.\n  Servicemembers transitioning to civilian life already face a \nmultitude of hurdles, from adjusting to everyday life, dealing with \nunemployment issues, housing and security, and poor mental and physical \nhealth, among other things.\n  Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve that we eliminate these and any \nother barriers. Thousands of veterans leave the service without knowing \nabout the VA, whether they are eligible, and what benefits they are \nentitled to receive.\n  Veterans who returned to civilian life during the pandemic faced even \nmore challenges to access and overall engagement with the VA due to \nclosures and the VA's limited operational capacity at the height of the \npandemic. We cannot leave these veterans behind.\n  Already, more than half of eligible veterans don't use VA health \nbenefits, many of which are due to confusion on eligibility and \nbenefits and lack of access to information. The pandemic only \nexacerbated this. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan this past year \nsimilarly impacted millions of veterans who now need that care more \nthan ever.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is not adding any new entitlements. It is \nsimply extending them to those who are equally in need. With my \namendment to this bill, we can ensure that newly transitioned veterans \ndo not miss the opportunity to access VA benefits they deserve and are \nentitled to.\n  As our chairman has said, when it comes to supporting our veterans, \nthe true heroes of our country, there is always more work to be done. \nThis bill is truly transformative and assures future cohorts of \nveterans receive the expeditious access to the healthcare they need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman is \nrecognized.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Escobar's amendment would expand automatic \nenrollment to servicemembers who left the military 90 days before this \nbill is enacted. There are already many existing mechanisms for \nseparating servicemembers to connect with the VA if that is something \nthey need and want.\n  As I explained during the general debate, I have a number of serious \nconcerns with the underlying bill. The Biden administration agrees that \nthere are challenges. I think that is an understatement. Regardless, we \nshould not be further complicating an already difficult implementation \nby expanding it even more.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Escobar amendment \nto H.R. 4673.\n  Mr. Speaker, seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and \ncare they have earned through their service is paramount to the \ntransition process. The Escobar amendment extends the automatic \nenrollment in VA healthcare to eligible veterans discharged within 90 \ndays before enactment of the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of the 175,000 veterans who served in Operation \nEnduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn are \nunaware of their eligibility for 5 years of VA healthcare upon \nseparation. Automatically enrolling recently separated eligible \nveterans into VA healthcare will support our aim to prevent veteran \nsuicides and improve their access to care during their transition to \ncivilian life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Escobar amendment.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \nprevious question is ordered on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar).\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Escobar).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appear to have it.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Allentown \nPolice Detective and Community Liaison Officer James Stanko, a man who \ndedicated his life's work to bridging the divide between police \nofficers and the community they serve.\n  Officer Stanko died on Monday, a huge loss for our community, but his \nlegacy lives on through the countless lives he touched.\n  Officer Stanko wasn't known for sitting idly at a desk. His passions \nlay out in the community where he was known for mentoring our kids, \nwhether it was through coaching basketball, talking at schools, or \noffering life lessons at the children's clinic.\n  As someone who worked closely with him put it, ``Our kids called him \nfamily.'' He was a calming, yet dependable force that everyone, \nespecially our youth, could turn to for guidance and support.\n  Officer Stanko never stopped trying to achieve his ultimate goal of \nconnecting the police department to the people that it serves.\n  Working as an Allentown police officer for 13 years, Stanko never \nwavered in his values of honesty, integrity, and, most notably, respect \nfor others. I was inspired by his sincere love for public service, as \nwell as his passion for our community that he was proud to call home. \nHe will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, as a Clinton County native, I rise today in \nhonor of the 2021 Division IV Ohio high school football State champion, \nthe Clinton-Massie Falcons.\n  On December 3, 2021, the Clinton-Massie Falcons defeated the \nYoungstown Ursuline Irish in a thrilling comeback victory that one \nwould expect to see in a movie.\n  Trailing 28-7 late in the third quarter, the Falcons kept their poise \nand refused to be denied. They shut down the Irish offense while \nscoring on three straight possessions. The Falcon's final touchdown \ncame on a fourth and goal from the 1-yard line with under 1 minute to \nplay.\n  With the score 28-27, the team didn't think twice when given the \nchoice. They went for 2 points and the win to bring home the school's \nthird State championship in just under 10 years.\n  To Coach Dan McSurley and every player on the Falcon roster, \ncongratulations. As a former captain of the East Clinton Astro football \nteam, I understand the obstacles that you have had to overcome to earn \nthis title. You have made our county proud and proven that hard work \nand determination truly pay off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden's Infrastructure \nInvestment and Jobs Act that I and many of us voted for, we are now \nputting those resources on the ground across America.\n  The first billions of dollars to go to California and every State in \nthe Union are now being put in place to fix bridges. Next, we are going \nto fix our roads and build our infrastructure to electrify our system \nthroughout the country.\n  These are the kinds of things that our voters sent us to Washington \nto do, to bring those resources back to every single community, every \nsingle one of our communities, and that is what we are doing here in \nCongress with a President who actually believes in the fundamentals of \ninfrastructure and making sure that we put our American workers back to \nwork to build our Nation as it should be and what we are so proud of.\n  We are the number one infrastructure place in the world, and we will \ncontinue to be so with these investments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-year \nanniversary of President Biden's inauguration and 1 year under one-\nparty rule.\n  And I ask: Is America better off? The answer is no.\n  Since President Biden took office, we have seen crisis after crisis.\n  We are facing an economic crisis. President Biden and the Democrats \nhad the tools to bring our economy back to the prepandemic records of \n2019. But instead, we have massive supply shortages, labor shortages, \nand an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high.\n  Our country faces an energy crisis. We went from being energy \nindependent to begging OPEC+ to produce more oil to offset the rising \ncosts. This is because of anti-American energy policies enacted over \nthe past year.\n  Mr. Speaker, the list goes on: an education crisis as our youth \ncontinue to face uncertainty in the classroom; a national security \ncrisis as our presence on the world stage has been weakened and our \nsouthern border remains vulnerable; and a crime crisis following \ndangerous defund the police rhetoric.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not the leadership America needs right now. In \nfact, it is far from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, today marks one year of Democrats in \nCongress working alongside the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of \nAmerican families.\n  I am proud of what we have accomplished so far, including the once-\nin-a-generation investment in our roads and bridges made by the \nbipartisan infrastructure law. With nearly 2,500 bridges in poor \ncondition, Illinois ranks third among States with crumbling bridge \ninfrastructure. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Illinois \nwill receive $1.4 billion to repair and rebuild these bridges, like the \nBlackberry Creek and Mendota railroad bridges in my district.\n  These upgrades will save Illinoisans money on costly car repairs and \ntime on their daily commutes. This long-overdue investment will also \nconnect our communities and support our supply chain, while creating \ngood-paying jobs and spurring economic development.\n  With the partnership of the Biden-Harris administration, we have \nspent the last 365 days delivering for the American people. Our work is \nfar from finished.\n\n[[Page H271]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of great respect and \nmourn the loss of Dr. Marcy Zwelling from California.\n  Dr. Zwelling, since 2012, has headed up the National Physicians \nCouncil for Healthcare Policy, which is a group of some 570 independent \nphysicians across the country. Dr. Zwelling not only challenged me but \nchallenged all 570 members of the Physicians Council to please advocate \non behalf of not only patients but also physicians. She dedicated her \nservice and life not only to patients, attempting to give them the very \nbest of medical help, but also for physicians. Physicians who many \ntimes are faced with innumerable challenges, not just to provide \nservice but also in their own lives.\n  So it is today I offer to the House of Representatives the great life \nof Dr. Marcy Zwelling who passed away this last weekend. May she rest \nin peace. May God bless her life and that which she gave each of us.\n  Whether she was helping organize one of the over nine conferences of \nthe National Physicians Council for Healthcare Policy nationwide, \ndeveloping new screening tools for patients with cancer, or supporting \nher fellow physicians, Dr. Zwelling served as an inspiration and \nservant leader for myself and so many others in the medical community. \nI will miss her leadership and inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the name of Dr. Martin \nLuther King and John Robert Lewis, our late colleague.\n  I rise today to say that we are not finished. The work of this Nation \nis not finished, even in the aftermath of a sinister vote on the floor \nof the United States Senate that could not see clearly to determine \nthat the Constitution and the right to vote rose above the silly and \ninsignificant rule of the Senate called the filibuster.\n  In the midst of that debate, we heard eloquent and beautiful \nstatements about the many times the filibuster had been eliminated or \nrelieved. We heard a brilliant analysis of the Constitution and the \nFounding Fathers' desire for the filibuster not to be in the \nConstitution, yet due process and the 15th Amendment are.\n  Mr. Speaker, we saw justice crushed and democracy gored. In Texas, of \ncourse, more criminal laws are now related to voting. Poll watchers can \nattack voters in terms of what they are doing. We are now in a \nconstitutional hearing in Judiciary. It is my commitment to go forward \non the John Robert Lewis and all the bills attached to it because the \nNation is crying out for justice. The country is crying out for \ndemocracy. We will not let it down. The Senate must continue its \ndebate, and we must get these billed passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind the American people \nthat today marks President Biden's one year in office and 365 days of \nhis disastrous failure at our southern border.\n  Forty percent of Americans graded Joe Biden's immigration policy with \na big fat F for his failures. His open border policy has proven month \nafter month to be not only unsuccessful but downright dangerous for the \nAmerican people.\n  More deadly fentanyl products have been smuggled into our \nneighborhoods this year than ever before. Nearly 11,000 pounds were \napprehended in the last year alone.\n  Biden's wide open southern border is poisoning our communities and \ncausing unthinkable harm. His bad policy is taking lives. It is no \nsurprise that our Nation's number of overdoses reached an all-time high \nin 2021. My heart breaks for the parents who have lost their children \nwhile our President plays politics.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have said it before, and I will say it again. Border \nsecurity is national security. It is time to stop deliberately \ndestroying the safety of innocent Americans for the sake of politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago, I spoke here about the \ndelays in our postal system, and a year later the calls to our office \nhave not stopped. In fact, they have gotten more frequent and more \nfrantic.\n  Since the start of this year, 50 percent of all the phone calls our \noffice has received are about disruptions in the Postal Service. These \nare from seniors whose essential medications and Social Security checks \nwere over 2 weeks delayed; folks with missing credit card statements, \nMedicare cards, past due still undelivered bills accruing interest that \nthey can't pay because their paycheck hasn't come in; small business \nowners reliant on the mail who are completely unable to operate.\n  Now, to be sure, the pandemic contributes to some of this. It has \nincreased demand on the mail system, even as postal workers are staying \nhome, quarantining, looking after loved ones. While leaders in the \nprivate sector have adapted to this moment, Postmaster DeJoy has \nresponded to this by eliminating overtime, closing mail processing \nfacilities, and removing mail sorting machines. He has made things \nworse.\n  Now, in the private sector we would fix that. A corporate board \nwouldn't tolerate it. They would hold this man to account. That hasn't \nhappened because we still don't have a fully staffed Postal Board of \nGovernors thanks to the Senate's failure to confirm President Biden's \nnominations. This is no way to run a business. It is no way to treat \nthe American people.\n  The Postal Service needs leaders as committed to public service as \nour letter carriers and mail handlers. Frankly, so does the U.S. \nSenate. It is time for them to act, to confirm these nominees and \nensure the post office has a fully staffed and fully functioning board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Lauren \nGollofon from Bozeman, Montana. Lauren is a 17-year-old senior at \nLiberty Online Academy and a former student at Bozeman High School. \nWhen Lauren became aware that the Pledge of Allegiance was not being \nsaid daily in public schools in Bozeman, she sprang into action. Lauren \nnotified school administrators that their failure to hold the Pledge of \nAllegiance every day violated Montana House Bill 543, and asked that \nthey hold the Pledge of Allegiance daily in accordance with the State \nlaw.\n  Within a week of her advocacy, local schools began to recite the \nPledge of Allegiance daily. When asked why this was so important, \nLauren said patriotism is on the decline in the United States. When \nstudents say the Pledge of Allegiance, they are acknowledging the \nfreedom and the values and also everyone who has died and fought for \nour country.\n  This display of patriotism demonstrates why a report just this year \nfound that Montana is one of the most patriotic States in the Nation, a \nranking which we are extremely proud of.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Montanans, I want to sincerely thank \nLauren Gollofon for her leadership, community activism, and her \ndedication to the core principles that make this country great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

He had a long \ncareer in local and State politics, serving as Adams County \nCommissioner for 4 years, beginning in 1979--where he actually helped \nme on one of my very first cases that I had as a lawyer--as the local \nboard member for the Regional Transportation District for 4 years in \n1999, and a State representative for District 29 from January 2003 to \n2005. He served terms on the Westminster City Council, including a \nstint as mayor pro tem. He was a longtime proponent of local rail and \nhelped found the advocacy group Rocky Mountain Rail.\n  Mr. Speaker, Bob was a devoted husband and a loving father and \ngrandfather.

Mr. Speaker, under recent comments President Biden made \nabout his first year, he talked about under-promising and over-\ndelivering.\n  Given what the year looks like, please, Mr. President, under-deliver.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country has seen unprecedented crisis and record \ninflation, supply chain disruptions, price surges, gas and energy costs \ngoing through the roof, food supply shortages, empty shelves \neverywhere, higher prices.\n  Unfortunately, the failures of Biden's first year in office isn't \nlimited to just the United States alone. No, he hastily evacuated our \ntroops from Afghanistan, leaving behind as many as 14,000 U.S. citizens \nand legal residents and friends, as well as billions of dollars of \ncountless weapons of ours that have fallen into the hands of the \nTaliban. So over 20 years of a record of Taliban and they get all these \nweapons to use against us or our friends in the neighborhood.\n  If this is not bad enough, the administration is now proposing to \nsend over $300 million in foreign aid, basically, to the Taliban regime \nto do all the great things they have been doing. People in Afghanistan \ndo need help, but we know the funds or food we send over there will go \nstraight into the wrong hands.\n  We need to have a better chain of supply to help them than what the \nBiden administration is proposing. The nonprofit rescue group known as \nSave Our Allies has been working tirelessly to rescue those left behind \nby President Biden's disaster over there. They warn that the funds and \nsupplies will not go into the hands of the average Afghan but, instead, \nstraight into the hands of the Taliban. We need to rethink this.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kahele). Members are reminded to direct \ntheir remarks to the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, the history of New Mexico and our rural \ncommunities predate the founding of our great Nation.

In addition to all the other disastrous policies and \nthe crises created by this President, it marks another year with 1 \nmillion babies being slaughtered in the womb in our country.\n  Tomorrow we will, once again, march for life here in Washington, DC, \nand I will be privileged to join that march. May it be the last time \nthat we do that before the Supreme Court rightly overturns the brutal, \nvicious, inhumane, dishonest, and inaccurate interpretation of the \nhighest law of the land--the Constitution--giving the right to \nterminate a pregnancy in the womb.\n  Sixty-five million babies have been lost since that happened nearly \n50 years ago. These are inventors, these are scientists, these are \nministers, and these are healthcare providers who are not serving and \nhelping our country here today.\n  Equality begins in the womb, and freedom begins in the womb, and the \nscience tells us that life begins in the womb.

Their dedication to their jobs is \ntruly inspiring, and they are literally saving lives every day. After \nalmost 2 years of battling COVID, our healthcare workers are mentally \nand physically exhausted, but yet they still show up every day to \nprovide care for others.\n  We can all learn so much from them.\n  I am honored to represent so many of them in my district in places \nlike Edward Hospital in Naperville, Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox, \nRush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, and Aunt Martha's Health Center \nin Joliet; just to name a few.\n  So I want every healthcare worker in America--doctors, nurses, and \nsupport staff--to know that they are not alone.

Mr. Speaker, in business, a 1-year review is customary. \nSo let's review the Biden administration's first year by the numbers. \nAs we tend to say in business, the numbers don't lie.\n  Regarding the economy, there are 6 million Americans unemployed while \n10 million jobs remain unfilled. The vast majority of small businesses \nare hiring, yet 95 percent report few applications. Inflation, Mr. \nSpeaker, is at a 40-year high of 7 percent. Gas is up 50 percent, and \nit costs about $100 to fill up the gas tank on a pickup truck.\n  Regarding national security, it is really no better. Two million \nillegals have crossed our border. Twice as much fentanyl is coming in; \nwe have over 100,000--sadly--fatalities throughout the United States. \nAnd we have 125,000 troops preparing to invade Ukraine.\n  We have 2-mile long lines for COVID testing in my district.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not going to hold our breath for corrective \naction to be taken by the Biden administration; they have stated how \nthey plan to double down.

Mr. Speaker, as I stand at this podium, I will speak \nfor about 60 seconds, and within those 60 seconds, an unborn baby will \nlose its life. In fact, in America, an unborn baby will have its life \nripped away every 50 seconds through the gruesome procedure of \nabortion. This is about 630,000 unborn lives lost per year--a number \nthat equals about 80 percent of my congressional district.\n  This is tragic. God has a plan for these children. They are our \nbrothers, sisters, friends, and loved ones. They are future leaders, \nnurses, doctors, farmers, and small business owners. But, most \nimportantly, they are human beings with a purpose from our Creator. \nThere is nothing more hideous than taking the life of the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Forty-nine years ago, the decision made by the Supreme Court in Roe \nv. Wade has resulted in the death of over 62\\1/2\\ million unborn \nbabies. Despite the three-quarters of Americans who want significant \nrestrictions on abortions, my colleagues across the aisle are still \nprioritizing their abortion-on-demand agenda.\n  This is senseless. Together, as a nation, we must make this the last \nyear we speak on this horrible anniversary. We cannot wait another 50 \nseconds, another 50 months, or another 50 years. Everyone is entitled \nto the right to life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, today we honor the life and memory of Manny \nT. Padilla, a leader in our community and my very, very good friend.\n\n[[Page H274]]\n\n  Manny served on many boards, commissions, and organizations in Orange \nCounty, and he also served 9 years on the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce \nof Orange County's Board of Directors.\n\n  Among his many accomplishments, he was honored as Volunteer of the \nYear by the University of Georgetown, as well as receiving the Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of the State of \nCalifornia.\n  Manny's story started in New Mexico when he was 17. Then his high \nschool principal chose two of the best students in his high school to \nbe part of the Boys State program. Manny was one of those students.\n  He moved to Washington, D.C. later on and attended Georgetown \nUniversity while he worked for then-Senator Dennis Chavez. Years later \nhe attended law school where he met his wife, Betty, at the same time \nwhile working at the Department of Labor. They had four children. And \nManny had a very long career in the private sector working for State \nFarm Insurance.\n  As we celebrate his life, we know his memory will serve as a great \nexample to this next generation.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nFoster).\n\n\n                          Brandon Road Project\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some great news about \nour efforts to protect Lake Michigan and the rivers and lakes \nthroughout Illinois and the entire Great Lakes region from invasive \nAsian carp.\n  Yesterday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that thanks to \nthe bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, $225 million of \nnew funding is headed to Illinois for the Brandon Road Project. The \nBrandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River in Joliet, Illinois, \nis the last best line of defense against the spread of this invasive \nspecies into waterways not just in Illinois but to lakes and \ntributaries throughout the entire Great Lakes basin.\n  The economic and environmental consequences of allowing this \ninfestation to spread would be massive, and that is why securing \nFederal funding for the Brandon Road Project has been one of my most \nimportant priorities for several years.\n  Last year, I joined my colleagues on the Great Lakes Task Force to \nurge the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize the Brandon Road \nProject. And 3 years ago, I hosted members of the then-Republican-\ncontrolled Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for a tour of \nthe Brandon Road site so that they could have a first-person look at \nthe importance of this project.\n  This injection of much-needed funding means that we can move forward \non getting this project done and protecting our waterways, and not just \nour Great Lakes, but the beautiful lakes and rivers that define the \nentire Great Lakes region for generations to come.\n  I just wish that more of my Republican colleagues had actually voted \nfor the bipartisan infrastructure bill to provide the funding for this \ngreat project.\n\n\n                             Infrastructure\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, for decades, Americans have been asking \ntheir elected leaders to fix crumbling roads and bridges and modernize \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure. For decades, politicians of \nboth parties promised to deliver on an infrastructure package. \nPresident Trump even promised that he would be the one person to get it \ndone. But he didn't, not even when Republicans controlled the House, \nSenate, and Presidency.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  It was President Biden and this Democratic Congress that finally got \nit done even though more than 90 percent of my Republican colleagues \nvoted against it. Thanks to this new law, people in my State will \nbenefit from robust Federal investment in the infrastructure that they \nrely on every day: $11.2 billion for highway and bridge repairs; $1.7 \nbillion to make sure that everyone has access to clean drinking water; \n$4 billion to enhance public transportation; $616 million for \ninfrastructure enhancements at Illinois airports; and over $100 million \nfor broadband internet expansion.\n  Just last week, the Department of Transportation announced that $1.4 \nbillion was already on its way to Illinois to repair bridges all across \nthe State. This is the largest investment in our State's bridges since \nthe construction of the Interstate Highway System, and it is just the \nbeginning of the infrastructure investments that will benefit the \npeople of Illinois every day.\n  I have to say, I look forward to meeting my Republican colleagues at \nthe ribbon cutting ceremonies for all of these projects that they voted \nagainst.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about the foundation of our \ndemocracy: the right to vote and why we must protect it.\n  I want to begin just by telling a little bit about me. My story is \nsomewhat unique. I didn't take the traditional path to Congress. Before \nI got here, I played in the NFL for 5 years as a linebacker for the \nTennessee Titans. After hurting my neck, I decided to pursue my other \ndream, which was to become a voting rights attorney, a civil rights \nattorney. While I was in law school, I decided to focus on voting \nrights because of what I saw happening in my home State of Texas where \nit was becoming harder to vote as the State was becoming more and more \ndiverse.\n  After I came back to Texas, I worked doing voter protection in 2014, \nsetting up poll watcher programs across the State of Texas, trying to \nhelp voters deal with the new voter ID law that had just been put in \nplace and that I knew was going to deeply impact so many Texans. Then I \nbecame a voting rights litigator suing States like Ohio and Wisconsin \nfor the laws that they passed making it harder for the people in their \nStates to vote.\n  Then I was lucky enough to rejoin the Obama administration and finish \nout that administration.\n  I decided to come home and run for Congress in my hometown and my \nhome district where I was born and raised. In 2018, I ran against an \nopponent who had been unopposed in 2016. I won, and I am now proud to \nbe representing the 32nd Congressional District in Congress.\n  In that campaign in 2018, I had the distinct honor of having \nCongressman John Lewis come join me in Dallas. Mr. Lewis is my hero, \nand to have him with me talking to voters and campaigning with me was, \nto say the least, surreal. We went on to become colleagues, and I \nconsidered him to be a friend and a mentor. I know that without John \nLewis, I would not be here today. There would be no Congressional Black \nCaucus.\n  So many of us would not be here today were it not for him, the other \ncivil rights leaders, and the foot soldiers who fought for the right to \nvote. That is why we named this critical piece of legislation after \nhim, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.\n  Now, this piece of legislation is not coming out of thin air. It is \nnot a Federal takeover. Many of the reforms are intended to address \nlong-held problems with access to the ballot box for many Americans. It \nis also meant to address the gutting of the Voting Rights Act by the \nSupreme Court in 2013, and the 440 voting restriction bills across 49 \nStates that have been introduced in recent years.\n  Many of those bills to restrict the right to vote have become law in \nStates like my own, in Texas, in Georgia, and so many other States. \nWhile other pieces address the direct and more recent threat to our \ndemocracy, including the counting of votes and the safety and security \nof election officials, this legislation is necessary for us to save our \ndemocracy.\n  Yes, we have had setbacks in this fight. Yesterday was another one. \nNot enough of our Republican colleagues in the Senate were brave enough \nto stand up to President Trump's lies and to vote for the same Voting \nRights Act that the Senate had unanimously reauthorized in 2006 that my \nconstituent, a Republican, President George W. Bush, signed in 2006. We \nwere just shy of having enough Democrats in the Senate with enough \ncourage to change the rules so that we could protect our democracy.\n  But I am here to say today, to all of my constituents and to anyone \nacross the country who is worried about our democracy, that we can't \nlose hope. We have had setbacks before, just as Mr. Lewis did, and we \nhave come back from\n\n[[Page H275]]\n\nthem. The American people have sent us a clear message.\n  In 2020, 155 million Americans voted in a pandemic. They risked their \nlives to vote. That is how important it was to them. Campaign finance \nreform; ending partisan gerrymandering; and expanding access to the \nballot by creating national standards around voter registration, early \nvoting, and vote by mail are all necessary for us in our democracy, and \nthey are commonsense ideas that are contained in the Freedom to Vote \nAct. They will fortify and protect this sacred right.\n  But let's talk about what is happening in the country because I hear \nall the time from folks that voting is not difficult; that there has \nnot been a rash of voter suppression laws passed across the country; \nthat this is a Democratic story that is being told.\n  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, between January 1 and \nSeptember 27 at least 19 States enacted 33 laws to make it harder for \nAmericans to vote.\n  Restrictive laws in four States: Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, and Texas, \nimposed new or more stringent criminal penalties on election officials \nor other individuals for helping their fellow citizens vote. These new \ncriminal laws would deter election officials and others who assist \nvoters from engaging in ordinary, lawful, and often essential tasks. \nPeople in Georgia can now be charged with a crime for handing out water \nand snacks to voters waiting in line to vote; lines that were created \nintentionally by restricting other ways to vote.\n\n  Montana eliminated election day voter registration, making it harder \nfor new voters or folks who have moved to vote in that State.\n  Arizona temporarily restricted the powers of their secretary of State \nto represent them in lawsuits. And the reason? Because that position is \nheld currently by a Democrat.\n  Other States have shortened the window to apply or the deadline to \ndeliver a mail-in ballot or have eliminated ballot drop boxes and \nreduced polling places, and the list goes on and on and on.\n  Mr. Speaker, 155 million Americans voted in 2020, the highest turnout \nsince the 1900 election. The Trump administration itself called it the \nmost secure in American history. Yet, the lies about the election and \nthe attacks on the right to vote have just continued and continued, and \nthat is why I am standing here today.\n  Because of this new lie, these new laws have been passed, and we are \nseeing voter suppression taking place in real time in my home State in \nTexas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just talk about my home State for a little bit \nbecause I hear from a lot of Texans who wonder why voting rights \nexperts like myself say that it is one of the most difficult States in \nthe country to vote.\n  I want to walk you through just how difficult it is to cast your \nballot in my home State. First, the State of Texas makes it incredibly \ndifficult to register to vote. In order for me to register my neighbors \nin Dallas County, I need to go to the Dallas County elections \ndepartment, take a short course, and become deputized as a volunteer \ndeputy registrar. That is just to register my neighbors. After that, I \nam able to register voters only in Dallas County, and I am only able to \ndo that for 2 years because it is going to expire, and then I have to \ngo back and get it reauthorized.\n  After I registered that voter which I have done hundreds of times, I \nhave 5 days to deliver the completed form that I filled out with them, \nor I face criminal penalties; 5 days. So if I lose it, something \nhappens, I will be held criminally liable. If I would like to register \nvoters in both of the counties in my congressional district, Collin \nCounty and Dallas County, I would have to go to Collin County and get \ndeputized separately there. If I meet a voter who lives in the city of \nDallas but doesn't know what county they live in, because four counties \ntouch the city of Dallas, I would not be able to register them unless I \nknow that I am deputized in their county, whether it be Denton County, \nKaufman County, Collin County, Dallas County. I have to figure it out. \nThat is just to register my neighbors as a lawyer, as a voting rights \nlawyer, for me to help my neighbor get registered.\n  If a voter would like to participate in the next election, they have \nto register at least 30 days before that election day. So if, like many \nyoung people, you decide that a week out from an election you are fired \nup, you are ready to go, you want to vote in that election, guess what? \nYou can't. Because you didn't get registered in time.\n  Unlike many other States where they have same-day voter registration, \nin Texas you have to have decided 30 days out from the election that \nyou were going to get registered and, hopefully, get through all of \nthose other hoops.\n  Right now, as we speak, the secretary of State's office is citing a \npaper shortage as the reason why they can't print out enough voter \nregistration forms, despite dragging their feet for years in expanding \nonline voter registration for Texans. That is all just to get \nregistered, Mr. Speaker. We are not even talking about casting your \nballot yet.\n  So after you have gone through those hoops, after you have gotten \nregistered, you have to then survive the purges of the voter rolls that \nare going on right now, such as in 2019, when Texas attempted to kick \n100,000 Texans--incorrectly--off the voter rolls claiming that they \nwere noncitizens. It was such a disaster the secretary of State had to \nresign.\n  Now, if you survived that, if you have gotten registered and you have \nnot been purged from the voter rolls to actually cast your ballot, you \nhave to jump through more hoops because Texas has the strictest voter \nID law in the country. In order for me to vote in the State of Texas, I \nneed to possess one of seven acceptable forms of ID which does include \na Texas handgun license but does not include a student ID like my \nconstituents at SMU, or UTD, or any school in Dallas might be issued.\n  A Texas district court found in 2014 that 600,000 registered Texans \nor 4.5 percent of those registered at that time lacked one of these \nqualifying IDs. Now, thanks to a court ruling, you can sign a \ndeclaration stating that you don't possess that required form of ID. \nBut that is not often communicated at the polling place. I know because \nI have trained poll watchers to try and watch for this. When voters \npresent themselves and they don't have the required ID, they are often \nturned away.\n  If you have a disability or if you are out of town, or you just have \ndifficulty coming to a polling place, you can't vote by mail very \neasily either. To vote by mail in the State of Texas you have to be 65 \nyears or older, you have to be sick or disabled, or you have to be out \nof the county where your election is being held on election day and \nthroughout the entire early voting period.\n  Recently, thanks to the State's voter suppression law, S.B. 1, this \nhas become even more difficult. As reports from counties from across \nthe State have shown, mail-in ballot applications are being rejected at \nan alarming rate. That is because this new law requires that people \nprovide either a partial Social Security number or a driver's license \nnumber on their application for a mail-in ballot, and that number has \nto match the identification on their voter registration. This makes it \nextremely difficult for voters to remember which ID they used when they \nregistered, perhaps decades ago.\n  In Dallas and Tarrant Counties right now, 40 percent, Mr. Speaker, of \nthe applications have been rejected. In Bexar County where San Antonio \nis located, it is almost 50 percent. If these rejection rates hold, \ntens of thousands of mail-in ballots and possibly more will be \nrejected.\n  It is now a crime, Mr. Speaker, for county officials to encourage \nfolks to vote by mail, meaning that if you are in a household and you \nare married and if a spouse requests a mail-in ballot, the county \nofficial cannot inform you that your spouse can also request a mail-in \nballot if they are eligible or they face criminal penalties. And that \ndoesn't even scratch the surface of dealing with voters whose names \nhave changed because of marriage or divorce, or a change in gender \nidentity, or whose names no longer match the names on the voter roll.\n  If you possess one of these IDs and if you are aware of your rights, \nyou may still struggle to find a polling place. According to a report \nfrom the Leadership Conference Education Fund, 750 polling places have \nbeen closed in\n\n[[Page H276]]\n\nTexas since 2012. This has disproportionately happened in counties with \nlarge Black and Latino populations.\n  The law also curbed other initiatives by counties to make voting \neasier. That happened during the pandemic, including limiting ballot \ndrop boxes, banning counties from drive-through voting, and opening 24-\nhour voting locations as they did in Harris County where Houston is. \nThey even tried to ban Sunday morning early voting to stop souls to the \npolls until they had too much outrage and they had to back off.\n  Texans in minority communities disproportionately face long lines \nwhen they get to the polling place in order to vote. This includes one \nBlack man in Houston who waited 6 hours to cast his ballot in 2020.\n  If you make it through all of those hurdles: register to vote, cast \nyour ballot by mail or in person via early voting or on election day, \nyour vote will then be diluted through aggressive partisan \ngerrymandering at the State house, State senate, and congressional \nlevel.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, Texas Democrats would \nhave to win 58 percent of the vote to be favored to carry more than 37 \npercent of the State's congressional seats. That is a State where Joe \nBiden earned 46.5 percent of the vote.\n  According to this analysis, Texas would have to vote very heavily for \nDemocrats in order to barely break the gerrymandering, and it would \nstill likely leave Republicans with a 2-to-1 seat advantage.\n  This is all due to partisan gerrymandering, which allows politicians \nto choose their voters instead of the other way around.\n  Gerrymandering doesn't just silence communities, though. It also \nsuppresses the vote. It is well known that competitive elections drive \nhigher turnout, which is why the recent State and congressional maps in \nTexas sought to limit the number of competitive elections as much as \npossible.\n  For the Texas voter that has found a way to register and cast their \nballot, and has ignored the impacts of gerrymandering, their vote is \nstill under attack, even after they have cast it.\n  Currently, right now, as we are 2 months out from the primary \nelection for our next election, our State's leaders are conducting a \nso-called audit of the 2020 election results in our largest counties at \nthe request of the former President of the United States, trying to \nprop up the lie that the last election was stolen from him--in a State \nthat he won.\n  All of these hurdles, combined with the potential discriminatory \npenalties, are making it difficult for the average Texan to feel that \nthey can engage in an election freely. Even worse, States across the \ncountry are following Texas' lead. That is why we need to pass the \nFreedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act, just very quickly, for folks who are \nwondering, because there is a lot of discussion about this, this is \nwhat it actually does:\n  It establishes automatic, online, and same-day voter registration, \nwhich would solve our voter registration problems in the State of \nTexas.\n  It makes election day a Federal holiday, something that should \nhappen.\n  It sets national standards for early voting and vote by mail, \nrequiring 2 weeks of early voting, including 2 weekends, and allowing \nany American who wants to, to vote by mail.\n  It bans partisan gerrymandering and establishes clear, neutral \nstandards and rules as well as increasing transparency and enhanced \njudicial review. This would address Texas' extremely gerrymandered \nmaps.\n  It creates a uniform standard for what forms of ID are acceptable for \nvoting.\n  It prevents States from subverting their own elections and protects \nelection records, legislation that I introduced here in the House that \nI am glad to see included in this final bill.\n  Of course, the Voting Rights Act needs to be restored. We need to \nmake sure that we have preclearance again. We need to have a national \nstandard. That is what the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act does.\n  This is a bill that passed the Senate 98 to nothing in 2006. It \npassed the House overwhelmingly. It was signed into law by my \nconstituent, again, George W. Bush, a Republican. Now, not a single \nRepublican in the Senate or in the House will vote for it.\n  This brings me to my final thoughts. On January 6, I was just a few \nrows back from where I am standing now. The doors to my right were \nbarricaded with furniture like this, which we use to hold paper, as a \nmob tried to break in and prevent us from ratifying the results of an \nAmerican Presidential election.\n  I along with my colleagues like Mr. Jones, who is here with me, were \nprepared for the worst. These doors were locked. We didn't know if \nthere would be a way out. But we were determined to do our job.\n  I think the most important thing that happened on January 6, the \nthing I hope that people remember that happened, isn't that we had to \nevacuate the House floor. I hope they remember that we came back.\n  We came back while there was still blood on the walls, while there \nwas still broken glass on the floor, while we ourselves were dealing \nwith our own emotional response to what had happened. While we \nourselves were shaken, we came back and we voted--yes, in a bipartisan \nway--to affirm an American Presidential election. Our democracy held, \njust barely.\n  Since then, we have seen a more clever, slower attempt to accomplish \nthe same thing that those rioters tried to do on January 6, which is to \nsubvert the will of the American people. We have seen it in State after \nState.\n  We have seen the worst rash of voter suppression laws that we have \nhad in this country since the days of Jim Crow. In many ways, it is \nworse because it is not 1965, Mr. Speaker. It is 2022, and we should \nhave made more progress by now. We shouldn't be having this \nconversation about whether or not certain Americans should be able to \nvote in our elections.\n  We have had this problem since the passage of the 15th Amendment, the \nidea that certain votes matter more than others, or that votes of \ncertain people who live in certain places are inherently fraudulent, or \nthat they don't know enough to be involved in an election.\n  I tell you what, I believe in the American people. I believe that \nthey know that our democracy is what makes our country great. Our \ndemocracy is what allows us to have this thriving economy.\n  People are trying everything they can to get into this country still. \nThey are not trying to join some of our autocratic opponents. They are \nnot trying to break into Russia or China. They want to come to the \nUnited States. We are still a beacon of hope for the world.\n  When strongmen and autocrats worry about the United States, it is not \njust our military they worry about. It is our ideas. It is the idea of \nthe United States. While that idea is under attack, I believe it is \ngoing to stand strong.\n  I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to all of my constituents, to anyone who \nmay be listening to this, the fight to protect the right to vote is far \nfrom over. The Senate may not have done its job yesterday, but I and my \ncolleagues will not give up that fight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones).\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, \nCongressman Allred, for his leadership in the fight to protect the \nfundamental right to vote and to save our ailing democracy. It has been \nan honor working with him, with Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and with \nCongressman   John Sarbanes over the past year on the John R. Lewis \nVoting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.\n  As you just heard, we are living through the worst assault on the \nright to vote since the Jim Crow era. And yesterday, on the Senate \nfloor, white nationalists used the Jim Crow filibuster to block voting \nrights legislation.\n  But they did not win the contest for the soul of our Nation. I rise \nto affirm that we the people aren't giving up that easily. We never \ngive up.\n  We the people didn't give up when, after we finally ended the scourge \nof slavery in this Nation, white nationalists fought back, violently \nunraveling Reconstruction, throwing duly elected\n\n[[Page H277]]\n\nBlack people out of office, and barring Black voters from the voting \nbooth for generations. We responded by organizing.\n  Progress came in fits. It took us nearly a century, but progress \ncame.\n  It came in the courtroom where Thurgood Marshall helped to end a \ncentury of legalized segregation.\n  It came on the streets, where the March on Washington and the \nMontgomery bus boycott produced meaningful social change.\n  Of course, it came in Congress where, after considerable pressure \nfrom the civil rights movement, this Chamber and the Senate passed the \nVoting Rights Act into law, and they overcame a filibuster to do it. \nImagine that.\n  Mr. Speaker, like you, I was hoping against all hope that today's \nstory would end the same way, with a majority of Senators doing the \nright thing.\n  To those of you watching at home, to the millions of you who put it \nall on the line to save our democracy, to see the Freedom to Vote: John \nR. Lewis Act become law, I feel your pain right now. But I do not \ndespair. As Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the NAACP's Legal \nDefense Fund, said recently: No story in the history of our quest for \nracial justice has ever ended with the words: ``And then they gave \nup.''\n  Our story, the story of building a true, multiracial democracy in the \n21st century, is no exception. The fact is, progress is not always \nlinear. It is messy. There are false starts. There are setbacks, like \nwhat happened last night. But the weight of history and the force of \nreason are on our side.\n  I grew up in the Baptist Church. To quote from the book of Jeremiah: \nLike a fire shut up in my bones, I know that goodness will prevail.\n  As the elders used to say: Trouble don't last always. Weeping may \nendureth for a night, but joy--joy--cometh in the morning.\n  Look at how far we have come already. Just a few years ago, democracy \nreform was a pipe dream embraced by only the most committed activists. \nBut thanks to an overwhelming groundswell of energy, of movement \nbuilding, of organizing, the Freedom To Vote: John R. Lewis Act passed \nthe House, and it came just two votes short of passing the Senate.\n  We are not going anywhere. We are more energized than ever to see \nthis through. We must pick up Senate seats this fall to make the \nfilibuster an impossibility.\n  This is the fight of our lives, for our climate, for healthcare, our \njobs, our dignity under the law, our future. We have no choice but to \nkeep going.\n  I am reminded of the words of Dr. King in his 1966 speech in \nKingstree, South Carolina:\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes, for this is the way we are going to \nstraighten up . . . the Nation.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until somehow we will be able to \ndevelop that day when men will have food and material necessities for \ntheir bodies, freedom and dignity for their spirits, education and \nculture for their minds.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes so that men and women will no longer \nwalk the streets in search of jobs that do not exist.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the empty stomachs . . . are \nfilled.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the idle industries of \nAppalachia are revitalized.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until `brotherhood' is more than a \nmeaningless word at the end of a prayer but the first order of business \non every legislative agenda.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes.''\n  Dr. King's words are as true today as they were nearly 60 years ago. \nBut while our work must include the ballot box, we know that it also \nmust go beyond it. We must envision the world as we want it, and we \nmust do everything in our power to bring about that world.\n  Hold your elected officials accountable. Educate your friends, your \nfamily, your neighbors. Change their hearts and minds.\n  Mr. Speaker, unlike John Lewis and his generation, we are not called \nto risk our lives. We are merely called to exercise the rights that \nthey helped to win: our votes and our voices.\n  Like those before us, let us march on.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n\n                        Remembering Lani Guinier\n\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, as we grieve the demise of democracy \nlegislation in the Senate last night, I rise in grief and in gratitude \nto honor my beloved teacher, the legendary Lani Guinier, who passed \naway earlier this month.\n  Lani Guinier's life defies summary. She began her career in the civil \nrights division at the Department of Justice. She led voting rights \nadvocacy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, often driving alone at night \nthrough hostile places, like from Selma to Mobile, Alabama, to win 31 \nof the 32 cases she argued. Due to her intellect and her sterling \nrecord of accomplishment, she was nominated to lead the Civil Rights \nDivision at the Department of Justice. She would go on to become the \nfirst woman of color tenured at Harvard Law School.\n  But like many great civil rights leaders, Lani Guinier did not define \nherself by the power she held or the acclaim she received. She defined \nherself by the power she unleashed within her clients, her students, \nand the American people. Lani Guinier found her voice by helping others \nfind theirs.\n  I am blessed that she helped me find my voice. So the day after the \nSenate tried to silence the voices of the American people, it feels \nfitting to honor her by speaking from the floor of the people's House.\n  I first met Professor Guinier when I was in college. I was taking a \nwriting course, and with her characteristic generosity, she agreed to \nlet me interview her. At the time, I wanted to be a civil rights lawyer \nlike my friend, Colin Allred. That warm evening, the Sun still glowing \nin the sky, she illuminated a different path forward for me. She \nrevealed to me that civil rights advocacy was about so much more than \nlitigation, as important as that is. It was also about leveraging the \npower of impacted communities to transform entire institutions. Without \nmeaning to, she helped persuade me to become a legislator.\n  When I arrived at law school, Professor Guinier taught me more than I \ncould ever have expected, not just everything I know about voting \nrights law, but also how to become the person I hoped to be.\n  As the first woman of color to be tenured at Harvard Law School, \nProfessor Guinier showed us that being a first is not a privilege but a \nresponsibility--a lesson that is not lost on me as one of the first \nopenly gay Black Members of Congress.\n  Her scholarship sought to show that every voice belonged in our \nconstitutional conversation. Not just John Marshall, but Thurgood \nMarshall. Not just lawyers like Constance Baker Motley, but activists \nlike Fannie Lou Hamer. Not just the people whose names make the history \nbooks, but the seemingly ordinary people living lives of extraordinary \nservice.\n  While most law professors obsess over jurisprudence--what judges do, \nsay, and think--Professor Guinier opened our eyes to demosprudence, the \nlaw that emerges from and enhances the power of the people. She knew \nthat justice is not the work of Justices alone.\n  At heart, Professor Guinier was a democratic idealist, a prophetic \nvoice who called us to reconstruct our democratic institutions and \nreimagine our democratic identities. She cautioned us that winner-take-\nall elections risk converting political competition into mutually \nassured destruction, intensifying conflict and underrepresenting those \nalready underrepresented.\n  She helped Congress reinvigorate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, \nwork the Supreme Court subverted last year in Brnovich v. DNC, and \nwhich I was proud to help restore by introducing the Inclusive \nElections Act, which we passed in the House but, unfortunately, the \nSenate rejected last night through the filibuster.\n  After the Court demolished the Voting Rights Act's foundation in \nShelby v. Holder in 2013, she urged Congress to not only repair the \ndamage--as we did in the House, but as was blocked last night by the \nJim Crow filibuster--but she also encouraged us to guarantee an \naffirmative right to vote. I have been honored to answer that call by \nintroducing the Right to Vote Act, which also passed the House last \nweek as part of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.\n  Beyond prescribing specific reforms and remedies, Professor Guinier \nurged\n\n[[Page H278]]\n\nus to see that democracy was not a zero-sum war over the power to \ndominate but, rather, a delicate project of sharing power with one \nanother as equals. ``Living in a democracy,'' she said, ``is not \nsomething we inherit. It is not something we inhabit, and it is not \nsomething that we consume. It is something we actively build \ntogether.''\n  Just as the Senate refused to heed the will of the people last night, \nthe powerful did not always heed Professor Guinier. But she knew the \npower of dissent. Whether dissenters speak from the bench, from the \nlectern like this one, or from the streets, what seems like their \nweakness is really their strength. The powerful coerce us to do their \nbidding, but dissenters call us forward to freely do what is right.\n  I am heartbroken by Professor Guinier's passing. I miss her.\n  But Professor Guinier, even now, shows me that accepting myself as I \nam can help me to center the people I serve. She inspires me to protect \nand perfect our multiracial democracy. I once asked her how to advance \nthat mission in today's times. She said, ``I think that is the question \nfor your generation.'' With our democracy on the line, may we, the \npeople, lift every voice to answer.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nwords.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities against Members of the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, and I will \nspeak at the end of the Special Order as well if there is time.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court abandoned women and \nbabies to what is now the multibillion dollar abortion industry, and \nalmost 63\\1/2\\ million unborn children have been killed, a staggering \nloss of children's lives that is more than the entire population of \nItaly.\n  Now, by at least affirming the constitutionality of the Mississippi \nlaw after 15 weeks, which we are all hoping and praying for, the \nSupreme Court may finally take a powerful step towards inclusion, \nrespect, and justice for the weakest and most vulnerable nearly 50 \nyears after the infamous findings of Roe v. Wade.\n  Tomorrow thousands will march for life here in the capital and across \nthe country.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), who is a medical \ndoctor, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins, and co-chairman of the \nPro-Life Caucus.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the hope that after nearly \n50 years, Roe v. Wade's attack on the most basic of human rights, the \nright to life, will soon meet its end.\n  Why are we going to be marching tomorrow? We do it because we believe \nthat every person, born and unborn, deserves a chance at life. We march \nto shed light on the incredible resources available to expectant \nmothers who find themselves in desperate situations. We march to send a \nmessage that humanity cannot sit by and quietly tolerate the deliberate \nending of human life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a physician, and I have helped thousands of women \ndeliver their babies over the course of my career. When I underwent my \ntraining, I was taught that caring for expectant mothers meant caring \nfor two patients, not one. As you can see here, advances in ultrasound \ntechnology have reinforced that training from decades ago. Mr. Speaker, \nthese are not blobs of tissue we are talking about. These are human \nbeings. The science is clear: From the moment of conception, new human \nlife enters the world with its own unique DNA, and in a matter of weeks \neven a heartbeat.\n  Mr. Speaker, we march for an end to the human tragedy of abortion, \nand I pray each day that we come closer to this righteous conclusion.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus.\n  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my great friend, Mr. Smith, and \na great fighter for life for many years, and we appreciate all of his \nwork on that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 49th anniversary of the Roe v. \nWade tragedy and to remember the more than 60 million unborn lives it \nhas taken and the tragic, irreversible mark it has left on countless \nmothers, fathers, and families.\n  Every innocent life is precious, from conception until natural death, \nbut for nearly five decades abortion has remained one of the greatest \ntragedies of our Nation.\n  The Supreme Court now has the opportunity to right some of the \nterrible wrongs committed in this country against the unborn since Roe \nv. Wade. I pray for our Justices, that they make the right decision, \nfor many lives will depend on it.\n  We will continue to fight for the lives of unborn children.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Fischbach for her \npowerful and eloquent witness for life, both in the legislature in \nMinnesota and now in the U.S. House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). I would \nnote that he is the prime author of two breakthrough laws. One is \ncalled the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, which is law, and the Born-\nAlive Infants Protection Act.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nhis long-time leadership in protecting innocent, unborn lives. He was \nhere at the beginning. The fathers of the pro-life movement here in the \nUnited States Congress were Chris Smith and Henry Hyde.\n  Speaking of Henry Hyde, we have had for a long time something called \nthe Hyde amendment, which basically said U.S. tax dollars could not go \nto pay for abortions, but we have a radical pro-abortion group of \npeople that control this Congress now. They think that tax dollars \nought to go to pay for other people's abortions.\n  They also believe that not only should we pay for abortions here in \nthe United States with the people's tax dollars, but they ought to pay \nfor abortions across the globe, and that is a reversal of the Mexico \nCity policy.\n  The Supreme Court is currently considering two cases that may \nfundamentally alter abortion in this country, and it is my hope, my \nsincere hope, that this Court will finally right a grievous past wrong \nand give the rights to the most vulnerable among us, the unborn, and \nprotect lives in the future rather than what has happened in the \nslaughter of over 63 million of our fellow citizens.\n\n  I want to thank Mr. Smith and all the other Members who will be \nspeaking here today for their leadership on this vital, vital issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to just say how much I appreciate the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for having this very, very \nvaluable worthwhile Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 63 million \nbabies who have tragically been aborted since the Supreme Court's \ndevastating decision in Roe v. Wade.\n  However, in the 49 years since that fatal decision, science has \nunmistakably proven that unborn babies can feel pain as early as 15 \nweeks. They even have a character. We can see it on sonograms.\n  But the left likes to ignore this fact. They seem to only value the \ntype of science that supports their political agenda. It is time for \nthe ``party of science'' to actually follow the science and to protect \nthe unborn.\n  I will always fight for life. I am proud to be up here with my \ncolleagues today standing up for these unborn, innocent, little human \nbeings. I sincerely pray that the Supreme Court of the United States \nwill make the just decision to overturn Roe v. Wade this very year.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bergman), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here with my colleagues\n\n[[Page H279]]\n\nwho believe so fervently in doing the right thing because if you seek \nyour wisdom from above, you will always do the right thing. I \nappreciate Mr. Smith's leadership.\n  As we stand here remembering the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I \nwant to remind my colleagues that standing for life--and I repeat, \nstanding for life--has historically been a bipartisan effort. Example, \nthe Hyde amendment, especially across Michigan's First District.\n  Since coming to Congress, I am proud to have stood shoulder to \nshoulder with my constituents as we collectively raise our voice, and \nour vote, for those who have neither.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The very first inalienable right described in the Declaration of \nIndependence is the right to life.\n  As a Member of Congress I have always and will always continue to \nfight to correct that right for the born and the unborn.\n  Protecting life isn't an issue of division. In fact, it is one of \nunity.\n  We must all work together to enact better policies and build stronger \ncommunities that create a culture of life.\n  Together, we can create a Nation that honors life and upholds the \nself-evident truth that every life is precious and must be protected.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a \ndistinguished attorney before coming to Congress and number four in the \nline of leadership in the Republican Party.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his \nprincipal leadership on this issue for so many years. He is a great \nmodel to us all.\n  Mr. Speaker, we in the Pro-Life Caucus are happy to join the March \nfor Life tomorrow here in the Nation's capital, but we are here today \nto acknowledge the tragic anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\n  As has been said, more than 63 million unborn children have been \ndenied their right to life in the past 49 years since that tragic \ndecision was handed down.\n  As we fight to protect the liberties of all Americans here in \nCongress, we have to remember to fight first for the most defenseless, \nand that is the child in the womb, who from the moment of conception is \na unique human being with unique DNA.\n  In the coming months you are going to hear a lot of vague and \neuphemistic language from defenders of abortion. Do not be swayed. The \ntruth is very simple, and it has never changed. Abortion takes a baby's \nlife, a person made in God's image.\n  We hope, we pray, we believe that 2022 is the year the Supreme Court \nwill finally recognize this truth once again.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a medical \ndoctor. So many of our leaders in the pro-life effort both in this \nCongress and legislation across the country are medical doctors and \nhealthcare professionals.\n  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New \nJersey, Mr. Smith, for his leadership in this incredibly important \nissue. Year after year he has stood for the unborn. Personally I want \nto thank him for that leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the 49 years since the case of Roe v. Wade was ruled \non by the Supreme Court, 63 million innocent unborn children have lost \ntheir lives to abortion.\n  Now, members of the radical left are trying to raise the number of \nabortions performed in the United States by repealing the Hyde \namendment, which for decades has ensured that no taxpayer dollars are \nused to fund this barbaric procedure.\n  As a doctor, I swore an oath to ``first, do no harm.''\n  When I was in medical school I swore that I would never perform, \nassist, or support an abortion procedure. As a medical student, as an \nintern, as a resident, and as a board certified physician for 25 years, \nI lived up to that pledge.\n  As a legislator in the United States Congress I took a pledge to \ncontinue to stand for life.\n  Now is the time for Congress to pass legislation that defends the \nrights of the unborn.\n  Now is the time for us to end abortions in this country.\n  On this 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade let us remember the lives \nthat have been lost and recommit ourselves to defending human life.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you very much, doctor, for your \nleadership and eloquence.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).\n  Mr. BURCHETT. We can all agree that it is wrong to murder a person, \nMr. Speaker, or in other words to take someone's life. So my pro-\nabortion colleagues need to answer the simple question of when does a \nlittle baby girl's life start?\n  Does it start at 6 weeks when the baby girl's heart starts beating? \nMost pro-abortion advocates oppose the 6-week heartbeat laws, so they \nwould not consider a heartbeat to be life. What about when a little \nbaby girl can start to feel pain around the halfway point in pregnancy? \nNot a single House Democrat cosponsored legislation that would affect \nbabies who can feel pain, so it seems they don't believe in life at the \nhalfway point either.\n  What about at 21 weeks, Mr. Speaker, when the baby girl could \npotentially survive outside the womb thanks to lifesaving medical \ntechnology? It seems simple to say if she could live outside the womb, \nshe must be alive inside the womb, as well. Yet most pro-abortion \nadvocates still say we should be able to kill her without a second \nthought.\n  Many of my pro-abortion colleagues also believe we should be able to \nabort viable babies even up through birth. Why should abortion doctors \nbe allowed to kill a baby who has developed organs, a beating heart, \nand even the ability to recognize the sound of their own mother's \nvoice? There is no excuse for aborting babies at birth, but the pro-\nabortion movement believes this murder should be allowed anyway.\n  It is time my pro-abortion colleagues start following the science and \nrealize those little babies are human, alive, and worthy of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for the incredible work he is doing. \nHe may not get his rewards here, but I assure you he will in Heaven.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Cline).\n  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his \nleadership on this issue and for yielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 49th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade my colleagues and I come together to \nremember the more than 63 million children who have had their lives cut \nshort in this country since 1973.\n  I stand here today for the sake of the women, for the sake of the \nchildren, and for the sake of the very future of our Nation.\n  Because of Roe v. Wade and the cases that followed its precedent, the \nright of the unborn to be born is denied throughout our Nation more \nthan 2,000 times every single day, and in several States throughout all \n9 months of pregnancy, which Roe permits.\n  This is a great stain on this great Nation.\n  We will not be silent here in Congress, nor will the hundreds of \nmillions of pro-life Americans across this country.\n  My colleagues and I will continue to stand for life and fight to end \nthe tragedy that is abortion.\n  We will remain steadfast supporters of life and serve as voices for \nthe voiceless and defenders of the defenseless.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nstrong statement.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller.)\n  Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \ntaking the lead on such an important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, let's reflect on \nthe importance of standing up for every human being's right to realize \ntheir full potential from the moment of conception.\n  In fact, Members of Congress have a solemn duty to defend those \nincapable of defending themselves, the most innocent among us, the \nunborn.\n  I will share a little bit of a personal story when my family chose \nlife. This was when my son was 3 years old. He\n\n[[Page H280]]\n\nwas involved in an accident with a head injury, and he was on life \nsupport. And many times the doctors told us he wasn't going to survive. \nIn fact, they said it is not an 80 percent chance, not a 95 percent \nchance, but it was a 100 percent chance that he was going to pass. We \ndid not disconnect life support.\n  We chose life. We prayed. And Freddie started to recover.\n  Today Freddie is fully recovered, and though his accident was decades \nago, this is an opportunity to learn about the value of human life.\n  Our creator has a plan for each one of us, and I will continue to \nsupport policies that ensure every life has the chance to realize its \nfullest potential.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nsharing that beautiful story about his son Freddie.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), another good \nfriend and colleague.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for all \nhis great work on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 49th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade, a devastating decision that we have \ncontinued to remind you has killed 63 million children in this country.\n  Who do we trust on this issue? There it says: ``In God We Trust.'' So \nif that is the case, this is what God said to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5: \nI knew you before I formed you in the womb. So what more evidence do we \nneed?\n  This shouldn't be a political debate, but now my Democratic friends \nare taking it one step further by attempting to abolish the Hyde \namendment, which prevents taxpayer money from funding abortions. The \ngovernment should not be using hard-earned taxpayer money to kill \ninnocent children.\n  However, I am optimistic that the fight for life will take a step in \nthe right direction.\n  The Supreme Court is currently reviewing Dobbs v. Jackson Women's \nHealth Organization, a lawsuit challenging a Mississippi law that bans \nabortion after 15 weeks.\n  I pray that the judges will rule in favor of life.\n  As the father of four and the grandfather of 14, I believe that life \nis precious, and I will fight to protect that life.\n  I have taken an oath to fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness, and so has every Member of this body.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his \ncomments.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).\n  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't believe it, but as I was \nwalking here today to speak about the value of life, my daughter called \nme, and she is headed to the hospital to give birth to my fifth \ngrandchildren, my second granddaughter. So isn't this an appropriate \ndepiction right here of my next granddaughter, who is going to be named \nGrace.\n  I used to be what they call pro-choice years ago. But I was lied to. \nYou know, they said it was just a clump of cells, just some tissues, \nlooked like a tadpole, nothing. But, you know, as technology has gotten \nbetter, we now have ultrasounds, and in our State of Arizona we passed \nlegislation so that the mothers could see what their babies really look \nlike. They have little hands, little fingers, little toes. They are \nhumans. They are real people. They are not just a clump of cells. And \nthat is why it is so disturbing to me that here in the U.S. Congress I \ndon't think we have one of my Democratic colleagues left that is pro-\nlife. I think they got rid of them in the primaries.\n  And when Republicans have come forward and asked the Speaker of the \nHouse, please, can we vote on a bill that requires medical help to be \ngiven to babies that are born alive in a botched abortion, she said \n``no.'' What has this country come to when we don't even want to keep a \nbaby alive after it is born?\n  My fellow Republicans and I are fighting hard for the value of life \nto protect the preborn, to protect every life. This is the most \nimportant thing that we can do.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her \nremarks and wish her congratulations.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).\n  Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being a leading \nexample on this charge for us.\n  Tomorrow will be a unique and significant day. Tomorrow many of us \nwill take the unfortunately similar steps of a march that began in \n1974. This March for Life however may be the last one before the stain \nof Roe v. Wade is lifted from this Nation.\n  However, even if we are so fortunate, the decision to continue this \ncrime will likely remain in many of the States.\n  Sadly, millions of Americans have yet to awaken, awaken to the \ncruelty and the evil that is abortion. The reason for this slumber is \nno less devastating than the murder of 63 million children. It is the \nfailure to recognize the inherent dignity of every life. This failure \nhas justified the intentional killing of a living child, led to the \nmany atrocities of the 21st century and this American tragedy. We, \nhowever, are not reconciled to continue this moral failing.\n  I often think about the abortionist who has woken up to the evil \nwhich he has been so complicit in. That moment when his heart converts, \nwhen he has been availed of the truth inherent in human life. He looks \nback at the trail of broken bodies that he has traveled.\n  But if we stop there at the horror and the tragedy, we would not have \nhope because we know that when he looks up he now sees those glorified \nsouls looking down on him, singing in praise and rejoicing in his \nconversion.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  There is renewal in our movement, and there is hope. There is the \nhopeful anticipation that everyone in every State will also see the \nobvious truth and the inherent beauty in the tiniest life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for including me in this Special \nOrder today.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \ncomments and leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), \na good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I may have a slightly different tone here. I was born in \nan unwed mother's home in downtown L.A., and so were all my siblings. \nIn my late thirties, I got an email out of nowhere, and it said: Hi, \nDavid. I am a friend of your sister's. Here is your information. Here \nis your birth mother.\n  We had a family discussion. I sent a very carefully worded note, and \na couple of weeks later, I got this phone call, this tiny voice \ncrying--and I am crying now also on the phone. And she is saying: I go \nto mass almost every day. On your birthday, I am terrified. Are you \nhaving a good life? How has your world been?\n  And I am crying on the other side, basically saying: Look, I have had \na great life. I got adopted by a family that brought me to Arizona. I \nget to live in the Phoenix area. I have a wonderful brother and sister, \nwho were also born in the unwed mother's home.\n  It became an amazing experience. My mom, who is right here, and this \nis my birth mom right here, they became best of friends. I have never \ntold this part of the story here, but my birth mom--both of them have \nnow passed away--had an early type of Alzheimer's, a type of dementia. \nBut my mom here had sent her all sorts of photos of me being a child. \nSo when you go into the house that they had there in California, there \nwould be my two 6' tall blonde half sisters and then pictures of me as \na baby growing up.\n  In her mind, I was always there. I was always part of the family. The \ndear Lord does heal.\n  But one of her best friends at the funeral turned to me and said: \nDavid, did Mary Lynn ever tell you the story of when we were in the car \non the way to Tijuana to go get an abortion?\n  As they got closer and closer to the border, she began to cry. Then \nthey got closer, and she started to hyperventilate. Eventually, she \nbecame so crushed with fear and sadness and terror, the girls turned \naround and went back and talked to her mother. A few months later, I \nwas born at that Holy Family Unwed Mothers Home.\n  Now I am this age, and I have an adopted little girl, who is the \nthird generation adopted in our family.\n\n[[Page H281]]\n\n  For those of us who passionately care about life, I think it is \nimportant we also tell the stories of how grateful some of us are to be \nalive; the amazing life my little girl is having and how grateful I am \nto her birth mom for giving us the greatest gift my wife and I have \never had; and understanding that the ultimate definition of love is \nlife. Maybe others out there can have the amazing experience I have had \nwith meeting my birth family and my family and my siblings' birth \nfamilies. It is just one amazing experience of joy of life.\n  That needs to be what, I think, we focus on. There is good here if we \njust change our hearts and our minds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much \nfor sharing that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher), my \ngood friend and colleague.\n  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey. It is an honor to join my colleagues here during this special \nweek.\n  Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, I approached the podium for the first time \nto give my speech on the House floor. I chose my topic intentionally as \nit is an issue that I will always champion: protecting the lives of the \nunborn. There is no effort more worthy than supporting life. This issue \ndefines our culture, our society, and our value system.\n  Every year, I am overwhelmed at the outpouring of effort, energy, and \nsupport that floods this cause. So thank you, and thank you to my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate who join me in this fight. Thank you \nto the health practitioners working nonstop to provide resources to \nhelp new mothers choose life. Thanks to our advocates on the ground, \nfrom the airwaves to in-person, for continually showing your support. \nAnd thank you to our pastors and religious organizations for seeking \ndivine guidance and strength in this effort.\n  I am inspired by you all and will keep doing everything I can to \ncontinue this fight to protect the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), and I \nthank him for his leadership on his pending bill.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey for \nhis years of unending work for the unborn. He has been so steadfast \nthat, from the bottom of my heart, I thank him for all he has done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the tragedy of abortion is the \ngreatest human rights issue of our day. The right to life is the \nfoundation upon which all other rights are built. The science is clear: \nAbortion ends a human life.\n  Studies have proven chemical abortion puts the life of the mother in \ngreat danger. In 2015, one in three women who took the abortion drug \nended up in the emergency room within 30 days. Let me repeat that. One \nin three women who took the abortion drug ended up in the emergency \nroom within 30 days.\n  Congress must do more to provide women and their unborn children with \ncare and support. I am proud that my legislation, the SAVE Moms and \nBabies Act, would prevent the FDA from approving new abortion drugs and \nwould stop these dangerous pills from being dispensed through \ntelemedicine.\n  I would like to thank everyone in Washington, D.C., this week who is \noffering their unwavering dedication to defending the unborn despite a \nculture that often marginalizes pro-life values.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), \nmy friend and colleague and leader in the pro-life movement as well.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nputting on this very, very Special Order so we can address a very \nserious issue that is plaguing our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a \nstandard of unparalleled violence against an innocent population in \nthis country. The biggest casualty caused by Roe v. Wade are the 62 \nmillion children killed before they had a chance.\n  Our forefathers believed that every man, woman, and child has a God-\ngiven right to life. Our Constitution makes no caveat for only those \nwho can walk, talk, and speak.\n  Because of my children and my faith, protecting life is a very \npersonal responsibility to me. As a Catholic, I can testify how faith \nencourages strength of character, urges truthfulness, and prioritizes \nthe sanctity of life.\n  The sad truth is that you will find many of the politicians claiming \nto be religious actively rejecting each of these faith-founded \nprinciples. The most basic way to exercise faith is by adhering to the \nTen Commandants, including thou shalt not kill.\n  I appreciate all of my friends and colleagues in Congress who are \nstanding up and speaking up for those who cannot today. I am grateful \nto know that there are Americans who will speak and fight alongside me \non behalf of millions of unborn babies who cannot defend themselves.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very \nmuch.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have always felt the 1960s was where America went off \nthe rails. Of course, Roe v. Wade wasn't decided in exactly the 1960s, \nbut the 1960s really, I think, began with the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy. You would say the end of that disastrous decade was \nJanuary 22, 1973, where the Supreme Court decided that abortion was \nlegal in the United States of America. Just a disaster.\n  Since then, 63 million unborn children have died in every State. Ten \nyears before that, abortion would have been considered illegal. All \nchurches would have been appalled by it, and all Americans knew it was \njust a horrible thing. But then, in an example of out-of-control \njudiciary, probably the most extreme example in our country, the U.S. \nSupreme Court came in and began a reign in which 63 million unborn \nchildren have lost their lives.\n  The U.S. is one of seven countries where late-term abortions are \nillegal. We stand with Vietnam, North Korea, Red China, together with \nSingapore, Canada, and the Netherlands. We are one of the few countries \nin the world, after all God has given us, that we decide to step up and \nsay it is appropriate to kill a child right up to birth.\n  In any event, today, we mourn the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We look \nforward to leaving this Chamber and marching in the March for Life, as \nwe hope that this is finally--given that there is an important Supreme \nCourt decision coming down--finally the end, or the beginning of the \nend, of this ongoing slaughter of the innocent in the United States.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nreminding us that the Chinese Communist Party and North Korea both have \npolicies like ours, especially as it relates to up-to-birth abortions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) for being a stalwart leader on this ever since I \nhave been involved in this. I appreciate him for being courageous and \nstrong on defending life.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we know, in the 49 years since the Supreme Court \ncodified Roe v. Wade, the science behind pregnancy and its diagnosis, \nso to speak, has advanced exponentially. We know this year the Supreme \nCourt will rule on a case called Dobbs v. Jackson to decide on limiting \nabortion access to 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n  As if there has been any doubt, really, of what a pregnancy means \ncommonsense-wise, that it is a child developing--not a blob, a tissue \nmass, a clump of cells, or a baby giraffe. No, it is a human being.\n  Medical advancements like ultrasounds since that decision 49 years \nago, prenatal surgeries, all these have shown the humanity of the \nunborn, which points to the value of life from the moment of \nconception, from that flash of light.\n\n  By 15 weeks in the womb, babies have fully developed hearts, can \ntaste, can make facial expressions, and can feel pain. With today's \nmedical advancements, a baby can survive outside the womb, incredibly, \nat 22 weeks and, in\n\n[[Page H282]]\n\nsome cases, even earlier with aggressive care and maybe a little bit of \nluck and God's blessing.\n  Roe v. Wade allows a baby to be born as late as 28 weeks. At 28 \nweeks, a baby is a living, breathing, developed person with thoughts \nand a future. We need revisions to Roe v. Wade. The future of our \nNation, its morality, its outlook, it depends on it. Abortion is a \ngruesome act that destroys families, harms women's health, mentally and \nphysically, and takes the life of the innocent.\n  I will always fight for the unborn, the sanctity of life, and our \ntraditional family values this country is founded upon. It is truly a \ncornerstone, and it is abhorrent that lives like this can be taken \nneedlessly when we have so many remedies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership all these many years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).\n  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this weekend, tens of thousands of men and women will \nfill the streets of our Capital to march for the lives of the unborn \nand to advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable Americans.\n  These men and women are advocating for an end to abortion, but they \nare not just seeking policy solutions. I know many of the devoted \nparticipants in the March for Life and about all the work they do in \nour communities to make sure that no woman ever feels alone or that \nabortion is her only option.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  They staff pregnancy centers, host diaper drives, provide information \non adoptions, and organize childcare for young mothers. They are doing \nthe work of making their cities and neighborhoods a place where no one \nis alone and there is a support system for every mother. There is \nsensitive and compassionate help available to those facing an unwanted \npregnancy.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we march for life this weekend, we march for a \ngreater future for all of us, one that values the unborn and sees the \npotential in every life. I am proud to support, champion, and stand \nwith these efforts.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), who is also a pharmacist.\n  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, my belief in God and my Christian \nfaith, they are the catalyst for every decision I make. Remarkable \nAmericans from across the country are gathering this week in \nWashington, D.C., to advocate for the protection of unborn children.\n  Written into the Declaration of Independence is our founding faith \nand principle that we are all created by God, created equally, endowed \nby our creator with the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. However, since the infamous Supreme Court \ndecision of Roe v. Wade some 49 years ago, we have fallen short of that \nnational edict by not acknowledging that life at every stage is \nprecious, valuable, sacred, and should be protected.\n  To the many Americans marching in person this week and supporting the \npro-life movement through other means, I want to say thank you for your \ndedication to this most worthy cause and know that you are not alone in \nthis fight. As you continue to stand up for those who cannot stand up \nfor themselves, remember that my pro-life colleagues and I stand with \nyou.\n  Mr. Speaker, I promise to use this platform right here in Congress \nand beyond to continue my vocal and unapologetic advocacy for unborn \nchildren. I will not stop fighting until our laws and policies protect \nlife at every stage. I hope you won't either.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), a friend and colleague for several \ndecades.\n  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize my colleagues this \nsolemn day. It is the day we commemorate the anniversary of Roe v. \nWade. I have said it before and continue to say, as I have many times, \nI am pro-life. I am pro-family. I am pro-child. I join my colleagues \nand constituents in Alabama's Fourth Congressional District in \nremembering the, literally, millions of babies that have been aborted \nsince that 1973 decision.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year we are possibly on the brink of a \ntransformational moment in our history, a moment of hope that we really \nhaven't had for many, many years, the reversal of or major changes to \nRoe v. Wade.\n  As most of us know, in June of this year we expect the U.S. Supreme \nCourt to hand down a decision on the Dobbs v. Jackson case. In deciding \nthis case, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to protect the lives \nof unborn children after the 15-week mark of pregnancy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all have to be clear. Even if the Supreme \nCourt upholds the Mississippi law as it is written, abortion will not \nbe banned nationwide. It simply gives the power back to the States. For \nme, my pro-life stance is deeply rooted in my Christian faith. Just as \nimportant, my opposition to abortion is about doing what is right. It \nis about protecting unborn babies. It is about not trying to impose my \nfaith on anyone else.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is because it is also rooted in science. Like much \nof science, our scope of knowledge on the development of unborn babies \nhas advanced farther than what we knew back in 1973. It is time for our \nlaws to catch up.\n  At 15 weeks, an unborn baby has a heartbeat. It can open and close \nits fingers and hands. It can taste. It can even feel pain. No argument \nin favor of abortion can overcome one unchanging fact, and that is \nabortion stops a beating heart.\n  Given developments of unborn babies at 15 weeks, abortions after this \ntimeframe often involve gruesome medical procedures that are dangerous \nfor mothers and undoubtedly painful to the baby.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, as we look forward, as we \nreturn back to our States, and as this issue is hopefully turned over \ninto the hands of the States, we can make groundbreaking steps in \nsaving the lives of the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas \n(Mr. Mann).\n  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my reasoning for voting \nto protect unborn American citizens. I believe that life begins at \nconception which is why I support adoptions, foster care, and crisis \npregnancy centers that work tirelessly to care for mothers and babies.\n  Kansans are leading the way in protecting the right to life by \nplacing the Value Them Both amendment on the ballot, this year's \nresponse to the Kansas Supreme Court's unthinkable ruling that abortion \nis a constitutional right. For my part, I have cosponsored pro-life \nlegislation including H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion \nAct, permanently prohibiting Federal funding for abortions and abortion \nservices. I have introduced my own H.R. 714 which would require the \nexecutive branch to notify Congress and the American public before \nissuing any new executive order pertaining to pro-life provisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, abortion has desensitized our Nation. I pray we wake up \nsoon and repent for the horrors we have visited upon America's most \nvulnerable, the unborn. Imagine what this country would look like \neconomically, culturally, socially, and spiritually if abortion hadn't \nwiped out an entire generation of Americans, 63.4 million people over \nthe last 50 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all of you who have joined together \nin this fight. Thank you for using your voices to defend the voiceless.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now recognize the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). As I said before, there are doctors who \nare outspoken in their defense of life, Dr. Thompson is one of those.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this \nSpecial Order to reaffirm my commitment to protect and defend the \nsanctity of life.\n  From the moment I stepped foot into this Chamber in 2009, I submitted \nmy promise to protect our most vulnerable, the unborn. In this Congress \nI have cosponsored 11 bills and signed on to eight letters relating to \npro-life policies.\n  Our Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence three \nunalienable rights. The first is the right to life. Sadly, from the \nmoment of the Roe v. Wade decision, the basic\n\n[[Page H283]]\n\nright to life has been denied to more than 60 million unborn children. \nWe don't know what those children would have grown up to do. Perhaps \nthey would have cured cancer, found a solution to Alzheimer's. The \npossibilities are endless with the loss of those lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with so many of my colleagues. We \nknow that there is hope on the horizon. The life movement is strong, \nand I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of pro-life \npolicies. It is my hope that one day those unalienable rights will \nextend to all Americans born and unborn. It is my prayer that this will \nbe the last march for life with Roe v. Wade being the law of the land. \nWhen we march next year, it will be in celebration for what we have \naccomplished for the protection of the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), a good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of life.\n  This Saturday, as many of the previous speakers had alluded to, is \nthe 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. As such, it is a fitting time to \ntalk about this administration's radical anti-life policies for which \nsome of us were caught off guard when President Biden was running for \nthe Presidency.\n  Over the past year we have watched President Biden and the Democrats \ncontinually push what I would consider an anti-life full agenda. First, \nthey gutted the Hyde amendment, a longstanding provision of \nappropriations bills that prevents taxpayer funding for abortions and \nhas saved an estimated 2 million lives.\n  Then the Biden Administration's Department of Health and Human \nServices changed the rules to essentially require healthcare providers \nto perform abortions, despite any moral objections they may have.\n  Finally, my Democrat colleagues passed a radical bill that removes \nexisting limits on abortion and allows abortions on demand, no matter \nthe age of the fetus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will always push back on their anti-life stances with \na clear and strong message of full opposition. I believe that every \nhuman life is precious and should be protected at every stage. \nThroughout my career, I have always stood for life. I will continue to \nfight against this administration's anti-life policies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today, after decades of noble \nstruggle and sacrifice, pro-life Americans are hopeful that government-\nsanctioned violence against children and the exploitation of women by \nabortion may be nearing an end, although in a very real way the \nstruggle to defend innocent human life now enters a critically \nimportant new phase.\n  Because of the Dobbs case, because the Supreme Court has finally \nseemingly accepted a relook at Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions, \nthe Federal Government and the States-based suit have new authority to \nprotect the weakest and the most vulnerable among us. Protection for \nunborn children is at a tipping point. In 2022, the Supreme Court can \nbegin dismantling the culture of death that it has imposed on America.\n  Mr. Speaker, for decades and right up to this very moment, abortion \nsupporters have gone through extraordinary lengths to ignore, to \ntrivialize, and to cover up the battered baby victim. With stolid \nresolve, they defend the indefensible.\n  Why does dismembering a child with sharp knives, pulverizing a child \nwith powerful suction devices, chemically poisoning a baby with any \nnumber of toxic chemicals--one method euphemistically called medical \nabortion--why does all of this fail to elicit so much as a scintilla of \nempathy, mercy, or compassion from the so-called pro-choice crowd?\n  Have the physical and emotional consequences of women been \nunderreported? You bet they have. I have been in the pro-life movement \nfor almost 50 years. Both my wife, Marie, and I do work with a lot of \nwomen who have had abortions. They tell us stories of agony that, just \nlike the fact of the unborn child's worth and dignity, has been \ntrivialized by the other side of this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, why are children born alive during some late-term \nabortions not given the same standard of care and respect as premature \ninfants born at that very same age? They are left to die, or they are \njust killed after they are born.\n\n  President Biden understands the gruesome reality of abortion and this \ninjustice. At least he once did. As Senator Biden wrote to constituents \nin explaining his support for the Hyde amendment, for example, \nprohibiting taxpayer funding for elective abortions, he said it would \nprotect both the woman and her unborn child. He stated at the time he \nhad consistently, on no fewer than 50 occasions, voted against Federal \nfunding of abortions. Further, those of us who are opposed to abortion \nshould not be compelled to pay for them.\n  Today, the President has weaponized the entire Federal bureaucracy to \naggressively promote abortion on demand at home and overseas, including \nfull court press to force taxpayers to fund abortions on demand \nincluding the repeal of the Hyde amendment.\n  Last September, the House passed a bill, the abortion on demand until \nbirth act. Of course, it had a different name that just cloaked the \nmisery that it would impose. That bill would not only codify late-term \nabortions, it would also nullify nearly every modest pro-life \nrestriction ever enacted by the States including a woman's right to \nknow laws in 35 states, parental involvement statutes in 37 states, \npain-capable unborn child protection laws in 19 states, sex-election \nabortion bans in almost a dozen states and waiting periods in 26 \nstates. By his words and his deeds, the President has become the \nabortion President. I think he wants to own that.\n  Mr. Speaker, this all comes at a time when ultrasound imaging has \nmade unborn babies more visible, with a greater clarity than ever \nbefore. Breakthrough research has now found that unborn children can \nfeel pain at a gestational age of 15 weeks and maybe earlier.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Today modern medicine treats an ever-increasing number of unborn \nchildren with disability and disease as patients in need of diagnosis \nand life-enhancing treatments before birth. Unborn babies are society's \nyoungest patients and deserve protection, not death by abortion. \nScience informs us that birth is merely an event--albeit a very \nimportant one--in the life of the child. It is not the beginning of his \nor her life.\n  As most people know, after the ultrasound the grandparents, the \nparents, and the friends get pictures of the child in utero. The \nultrasound pictures are the first baby pictures that are now plastered \non all of our refrigerators in great expectation for that event called \nbirth.\n  The right to life is the first human right, and it must be guaranteed \nto everyone regardless of race, age, sex, disability, stage of \ndevelopment, or condition of dependency. Life is not just for the \nplanned, the privileged, or the perfect.\n  We need to protect these innocent children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nRoy) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues who have been \ndown here on the floor of the House of Representatives for the most \npart of the last hour talking about the importance of defending life, \nthose infamous--or famous or important words, I should say, in the \nDeclaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Nothing can be more important than this body focusing on defending \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and my colleagues' focus \non life, as we sit here now 49 years removed from a Supreme Court \ndecision taking out of the hands of the people and putting it into the \nhands of unelected judges' decisions, about the beginning of life, when \nlife begins, the important reality of a people defending life.\n  What is controversial about defending life?\n  It is a question for this body.\n\n[[Page H284]]\n\n  What is controversial about defending life when we talk about life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness and when we talk about living on \nthis Earth while God gives us the precious time we have here?\n  What are we going to do with that time?\n  Are we going to live free?\n  Are we going to be able to pursue happiness?\n  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: one might wonder here \nnow 1 year into the current administration, the Biden administration, \nwhether the average American would say that he or she is free to pursue \nhappiness.\n  Are we free?\n  Are we free to pursue happiness when, in fact, just a few miles \naway--and, frankly, a few thousand feet--from this Chamber where we are \nright now, restaurants are being chastised and pursued by the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia representing this area that \nforms our Nation's Capitol because those restaurants may not believe \nthat it is in their interest or the interest of the people whom they \nserve to be checking papers and to be checking so-called vaccine \npassports or vaccine passes?\n  One restaurant in particular over on H Street--which was one of the \nearly restaurants on H Street as it was revitalizing--has been fined, \nberated, and harassed by the Government of the District of Columbia for \nwanting its doors to be open and not wanting to harass its patrons. \nThey want them to use their own free will to make a decision about what \nis in their interest. They don't want to live in a republic where you \nare forced to show papers to walk about and to engage in society, to \nfreely move about and engage in commerce.\n  The very heart of the kinds of ideas that the Founders meant and what \nJefferson meant when he penned pursuit of happiness is that we not \nallow a government through tyrannical policies to interfere with our \npursuit of happiness: our ability to go have a business, our ability to \ngo out and take care of our family, our ability to move about and to \nengage in commerce, our ability to create wealth and opportunity for \nour children and our grandchildren, to be able to get healthcare, and \nto be able to be secure in our possessions, secure in our belongings, \nand secure in our own homes.\n  I would ask this question: Is the United States more secure than it \nwas 1 year ago?\n  Is the United States stronger economically than it was 1 year ago?\n  Is the United States stronger on the world stage?\n  Are we safer from our enemies than we were 1 year ago?\n  Is our border secure?\n  Are we able to afford energy and have reliable energy to heat our \nhomes, fuel our cars, provide jobs, and keep us warm in the winter and \ncool in the summer?\n  Are we able to do that better more than 1 year ago?\n  The answer very clearly to all of those questions is a resounding \n``no.''\n  Do you think it is an accident that I just spent 2 hours in a hearing \nin the Judiciary Committee bemoaning the United States Senate for \nholding the line on the filibuster which Democrats and this President \nwanted to throw over the wall in the name of voting rights because \nnobody can oppose something called voting rights?\n  They put up those words, they call it the Voting Rights Act, and they \nname it after people we serve with in the Chamber to provide maximum \nguilt if you dare stand up and say, Mr. Speaker, that the people in the \nStates ought to be able to decide how to ensure that the elections of \nthe people who represent them are secure; that you dare to have a voter \nID favored by 80 percent of the American people.\n  But yet let's go back to what I just said: I have to have an ID just \nto walk in and buy a hamburger in the Nation's Capitol, but I cannot \nhave an ID to vote. No. No. No. That is Jim Crow 2.0 I am told by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  I actually had colleagues on the committee today walking through the \nhorrors of the poll tax--the jelly bean counting and all of the \nobstructions put into place for voting in the 1950s and 1960s that the \nVoting Rights Act nobly pursued to correct--and then tried to compare \nthat to voter identification.\n  They tried to compare that to wanting to make sure that mail-in \nballots aren't abused by anybody in any party, even though, by the way, \nthose bastions of crazy conservatism, Jimmy Carter and James Baker, \ncame out in a report over a decade ago that The New York Times quoted \nsaying precisely that mail-in ballots are the area where you have the \nmost fraud.\n  Now, all of us want to have integrity and belief in our elections. \nBut our Democratic colleagues want to use that issue to divide us, as \nPresident Biden literally admitted yesterday. In his 1-hour marathon \nwandering, meandering press conference, he literally said that he could \nnot say whether the elections will be legitimate this fall unless--\nunless--we embrace the legislation that he says must get passed and \nthat we must set aside the traditions of the Senate to jam it through. \nAnd all of it, very clearly, is to set the stage for a lack of faith \nand belief in the elections that are coming this November.\n  Again I ask: Is America stronger or weaker?\n  Is it richer or poorer? More secure or less safe?\n  We know the answer, and that is why my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle wish not to talk about those issues. We don't want to have \na debate about crime on the floor.\n  Do any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to come \ndown to the floor right now and have a debate about crime in the United \nStates?\n  Do they?\n  Do you think a 50 percent increase in crime in Austin, a 50 percent \nincrease in crime in San Antonio, a 19-year-old woman shot in a Burger \nKing in New York City, a 24-year-old student murdered walking the \nstreets of Los Angeles, train robberies in 21st century America with \nlitter all over the tracks in Los Angeles, is an accident?\n  Or could it be that radical leftists who are funded to take over the \ndistrict attorneys' offices in cities across America and radical city \ncouncils like the Austin City Council and leftists in this Chamber \nbelieve that letting criminals out on the streets and believe in not \nprosecuting people is going to make our country safer?\n  It is empirically and obviously untrue.\n  The American people see it. And I promise you, Mr. Speaker, take this \nbet: We will not have a debate on the floor of this body about crime \nwhile I am here this year. It will not happen. My Democratic colleagues \nwould not dare have a debate about crime because they would get \nabsolutely decimated.\n  They sure as heck do not want to have a debate about the border.\n  Do you want to talk about 2 million apprehensions?\n  Do you want to talk about 1 million people released?\n  Do you want to talk about dead Texans?\n  Do you want to talk about fentanyl pouring into our communities, \n100,000 dead Americans, opioid poisonings of our youth, and kids taking \nXanax and dying because cartels are flooding into our country while \nChina drives them right up through Mexico?\n  Not a person in this Chamber on the other side of the aisle wants to \ncome to the floor and have an adult debate about why our country is \nmuch less secure and much more endangered at the hands of the cartels \nand of people making money trafficking in human beings and undermining \nour security and safety in the United States of America.\n  I promise you, Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden and the Nancy Pelosi Democrats \nhave no interest in having a debate about the border because it is an \nembarrassment and it is a travesty.\n  Ranches are getting overrun, people are dying, bullets are being \nfired across at our own Border Patrol, the National Guard is having to \nfire at cars coming across the border, livestock is getting out, bodies \nare stacking up in body trailers in Brooks County, Texas, and cartels \nare making hundreds of millions of dollars on a daily basis driving \nfentanyl into our kids' communities and schools.\n  No, no, no. We do not want to have a debate about the state of our \nborder.\n  Do we want to have a debate about the state of healthcare mandates?\n  No. No. This body has no debate but embraces rules. We must wear \nmasks, they say. For a year and a half we have\n\n[[Page H285]]\n\nbeen excoriated--even fined--if you don't wear a mask the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives--masks which are very clearly proven--fabric \nmasks--to have no real discernible benefit over the last year and a \nhalf of the mandates that say you must wear a face covering.\n  They said: Well, are we going to mandate N95s?\n  Are we going to have to wear N95s on the floor?\n  Do they want to talk about the negative effects in the study that \nwearing N95s for a prolonged period of time, what that does for \npeople's health and well-being, breathing carbon dioxide, minimizing \nyour cognitive ability if you wear N95s for a long time?\n  Some people might joke: Would it make any difference on the floor of \nthe House if you minimized the cognitive ability of the Members of the \nHouse? You could argue that it may not make any difference whatsoever. \nI am looking in the mirror myself.\n  We do not want to have a debate on the floor of the House on \nanything, by the way, much less the reality of what has been happening \nwith respect to this virus and our response to it; and what Anthony \nFauci engaged in with respect to the reality of the truth of funding \ngain-of-function research knowing full well the dangers, working to \ncover that up and hide from the American people how this virus came \nabout; not wanting to pursue the truth on that, not wanting to pursue \nthe truth or conduct studies on natural immunity.\n  We have study after study after study coming out right now. I could \npull out on my phone and pull up study after study now finally \ndemonstrating and showing how natural immunity is more powerful than \nvaccinations, and people don't want to be able to have that honest \nconversation.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  An adult leadership would have done like the Nation of Japan saying: \nWe believe that vaccines are effective for a large group of people. We \nbelieve that there are some risks. You are adults. We won't mandate. \nYou decide.\n  We can't do that in the supposed land of the free? We sit up here and \nwe stare at that American flag and we talk about the Senate being the \ngreatest deliberative body. They don't really debate. This being the \npeople's House, the people's Chamber, when was the last time the \nSpeaker heard a robust debate on the floor of the House with multiple \nMembers?\n  When was the last time we offered an amendment on the floor of the \nHouse in open debate that wasn't predetermined by all of the Rules \nCommittee overlords who govern our lives? Democrat and Republican, I do \nwant to say.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 years since we have had an amendment \noffered on the floor of the House in open debate. Do you want to know \nwhy we can't do anything in this Chamber? Because we don't ever debate. \nWe don't ever actually have a discussion, throw things out there and \nthen vote. Maybe, just maybe, we come to some bipartisan agreement.\n  I am happy to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nDean Phillips and I worked on the PPP Flexibility Act. Abigail \nSpanberger and I have introduced legislation called the TRUST Act to \ndeal with stock trading believing that might help improve people's \nfaith and confidence in this body. I have introduced numerous bills and \npassed numerous bills with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. That is not what this is about.\n  It is about a broken body refusing to actually debate, refusing to \nactually engage, refusing to offer amendments. Both sides do it. That \nneeds to end.\n  The last point that I will make on that point, if you want this body \nto function again, you have to stop spending money we don't have. If \nyou keep writing blank checks, how on Earth is there a check against \nthe wisdom of the policy? You just keep writing a check to keep doing \nthe same thing or to do something different. You can't run a business \nthat way. You can't run a home that way. You can't run a church that \nway. You can't run a legitimate school that way. But no, no, we just \nkeep writing checks to fund the expansion of government, to fund the \ncreation of programs no matter who is in power.\n  Over the last year, we have seen what that causes when it is then \nleft in the hands of an administration that literally does not care \nabout the rule of law.\n  To be very clear, this administration is ignoring the rule of law, \nignoring their oath, ignoring their duty to enforce the laws of the \nUnited States, ignoring their duty to secure the border, ignoring their \nduty to stand up in defense of the men and women in blue, to follow the \nlaws around the United States, ignoring their oath to stand up and \ndefend the United States against our foreign enemies; hold the line \nagainst Russia; push back on Russia; sanction them; hold the line on \nNord Stream 2; stand alongside Ukraine; push back on China; stop \nappeasing them.\n  Don't leave $85 billion sitting there in the hands of terrorists when \nwe walk away and abandon our duty and leave those men and women in the \nfield, and then have 13 dead marines to show for it.\n  That is the legacy of the first year of this administration. But will \nPresident Biden, when he strolls to that podium on March 1 for his so-\ncalled State of the Union, and we are all spread out, and all wearing \nmasks, and doing whatever the heck we are going to do--not actually \ndoing the people's business--will he address any of those issues?\n  Will he talk about border security? Will he talk about how we are \nweaker around the world? Will he talk about the crime on the streets of \nLos Angeles, New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Chicago?\n  Will he talk about the businesses getting crippled by mask mandates \nand health mandates?\n  Will he talk about the children who are now having mental health \nissues, the people who are sick; the diseases that weren't dealt with, \nall to push a vaccine mandate that goes contrary to the pursuit of \nhappiness and our right as Americans to live free?\n  Will he talk about any of those things? Will he talk about the fact \nthat the United States of America is sitting on one of the world's \nlargest reservoirs of energy and, yet, we are wondering even in Texas \nwhether you can have the lights on because we built no nuclear power \nplants.\n  We slowed down our production of clean burning natural gas, all \nchasing unicorn energy policies of wind and solar as if they can \npossibly, possibly power the world at the level that is needed for the \nproper amount of human flourishing while 3 billion people around this \nplanet do not have access to abundant energy and power.\n  Will the President of the United States come down here and talk about \nthat or will he get up there and just talk about: Well, we are going to \nbe net zero in our carbon production by 2035, or 2050, or make up some \ntotally arbitrary number without regard at all to what that does to the \nprice of energy and the availability and abundance of energy.\n  All of this has real-life consequences for Americans. People die. \nHouses get cold. People can't get access to energy. They can't afford \nenergy. They lose jobs. You have stagnation and then you have the \nbrilliance of this administration and the brilliance of those in the \nmedia starting to talk about energy and food price control because, of \ncourse, that is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nresort to.\n  They will sit there and bemoan markets when they don't let the \nmarkets work. Healthcare markets never work. We haven't had a \nhealthcare market in decades. It is an absolute lie; and I am looking \nat you Big Healthcare. I am looking at you Big Pharma. I am looking at \nyou hospitals. I am looking at you Big Insurance. You made out like \nbandits after ObamaCare. You minted money. And probably three-quarters \nof the people in this Chamber fattened their wallets and \ntheir portfolios riding the back of all of that Big Healthcare \nenrichment, all at the expense of poor Americans around this country \ntrying to get access to a doctor without having to call some bureaucrat \nin the government, the VA, or an insurance company, or however it may \nbe, but it sure as heck isn't their doctor.\n\n  We don't have health freedom in this country. We have mandated Big \nHealthcare, Big Government, Big Insurance, bureaucracy. And everybody \nknows it. Everybody knows it because you all had to deal with it. You \nhave\n\n[[Page H286]]\n\nhad to call somebody. You had to call some kid sitting in Omaha in some \nphone bank telling you which doctor you can go to 2,000 miles away. \nThat is the truth, and we all know it. We sit in here, we roll in here \nand we say: Let's spend more money and create a government program. \nLet's spend more money we don't have.\n  Not one person in this body will come down here and truly debate any \nof these truths when you are $30 trillion in debt; when you are funding \nthe very FBI going after parents for daring to stand up and defend \ntheir children in a school board meeting; when you are funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that is literally lying to the American \npeople saying our border is secure while hundreds of thousands of \npeople come across.\n  You want to know what happened in that synagogue? Because we don't \nhave a dang clue who is coming to the United States, and this \nadministration doesn't care. They don't care. They don't care what list \nthey are on. They don't care whether they pose a danger to the United \nStates of America. They don't care at all who is coming into this \ncountry. And they sure as heck don't care what is happening to the \npeople of Texas, Arizona, or, frankly, everybody around this country \nwho is having to bear the cost, who is having to bear the burden of \nwhat wide-open borders means to the United States of America.\n  Complain about Mayorkas? We should impeach him for failing to \nfaithfully execute the laws of the United States of America, \nendangering Americans in the process, ignoring the laws of the United \nStates. And that is what is happening. That is what is happening.\n  America is poorer, sicker, and less safe a year into the Biden \nadministration, and that is the truth. Our enemies know it. That is why \nRussia is going after Ukraine. That is why China is rattling on a daily \nbasis. That is why Russia, China, and Iran are talking about joint \nexercises. That is why the cartels are emboldened. That is why there \nare people marching through Mexico from all over the world coming to \nour southern border. That is why there are people on the streets \nbreaking into businesses, assaulting people on the streets and killing \nthem, raping them. It is happening every single day in the United \nStates of America with reckless abandon while Democrats in district \nattorney's offices, Democrats in the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats in this administration do nothing about it and do not care \nthat the American people are left holding the bag.\n  Then they want to talk about taking away our Second Amendment rights \nand our ability to defend ourselves. Well, that crap ain't going to \nhappen because we are going to defend ourselves in the land of the \nfree. We are going to stand up and defend our communities and defend \nour families. We are going to stand up in defense of the Constitution \nand limited government and freedom to be able to protect our families \nand protect our States when this administration is letting this country \nburn.\n  It dares to do an hour-long press conference, lecturing the people \nfor wanting to make sure their elections are secure, for daring to say \nthat we should have voter identification when that same administration \nis ordering vaccine mandates that are causing healthcare workers to \nlose their jobs; causing healthcare workers in long-term health \nfacilities to be unable to carry out their jobs.\n  And then there is the talk about, oh, the burden on hospitals. Well, \nyou just caused 20 percent of nurses to have to leave because you were \nmandating they take a jab for something that is a year old that Pfizer \nis making billions of dollars on. Then we won't even have a hearing \nabout why on Earth we are having this virus in the first place, because \nof what Anthony Fauci knew and what NIH was up to and what China was up \nto.\n  We won't have a hearing about natural immunity. We won't have a \nhearing about the dangers and levels of dangers of the vaccines, what \nthey may be. Again, my polio-stricken father who is 79 has been \nvaccinated. I refuse to say whether I have been vaccinated. I think it \nis a principle for Americans that they shouldn't have to say.\n  My point is, there are people for whom the vaccine makes sense. There \nare people for whom the vaccine does not make sense. Mandating a jab in \na 5-year-old is irresponsible and it is dangerous. We should have that \nconversation instead of blindly walking around preaching what other \npeople should stick in their dang arm.\n  But that is what we do in the people's House. I am sitting here in an \nempty Chamber--with the Speaker, respectfully--and that is it. They are \nall jet-fumed out, leaving town. Oh, we shut down earlier. Let's get \nout of here. Or they are out at some fundraiser or something.\n  Let's have a debate on these issues. Let's seek the truth. I don't \nknow all of the truth on all of those issues. I don't know the specific \nrisks. I have read a lot about what is going on with the vaccines, \npositive and negative. But it is becoming very, very clear that it \ndoesn't do squat to stop the spread. So you are left basically saying: \nWell, it is better for you so that you don't die in the hospital.\n  Well, let's look at the data on that. But why don't we just present \nthe information and let the American people decide? Japan's vaccine \nrate is a lot higher than ours and ours has mandates. All they did was \nsay: We think it is good. There are some risks. You decide. We can't do \nthat in America?\n  We can't just go down to the border and say: You know what, it is \nbetter for migrants, better for Texans and all Americans, bad for \ncartels, bad for China, if we secure our border. That is the truth. \nTalk to the migrants getting abused. Talk to the people in south Texas. \nGo to Laredo and Webb County. Sit down with the Brown people in Laredo \nwho will say: We are pretty ticked off with this administration about \nhow they are handling the border.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might be up for a rude \nawakening pretty soon about their expectations of what voters are \nvoting for them and what voters are not because there are a lot of \npeople in this country that are sick and tired of the elite in this \ntown, immersed in the swamp, promoting Big Healthcare, promoting Big \nTech, promoting Big Government, minimizing the rights and the abilities \nof Americans to live their lives the way they see fit.\n  That is our calling as we head to 2026, our 250th birthday of the \nUnited States of America, which comes up in 4-and-a-half years. Will we \nbe able to say that we live in the land of the free? Will we be able to \nsay that we are pursuing happiness; that we are the country of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness?\n  We will only be able to do that if we stand up and secure our \nNation's sovereignty, defend our streets, protect our families, stand \nup to enemies around the world, and limit this body to the job that it \nwas given in the Constitution: limit our spending to the dollars that \nwe have and responsibly lead this country and represent the people so \nthat this country can, in fact, be great in our agreements and our \ndisagreements in a Federalist Republic where we are able to live free.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, last night was a reminder of a difficult \nbut important reality of our great democracy: The march to freedom, \nthrough thick and thin, is never over--and we have to keep marching.\n  While last night's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate \nDemocrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark \nmoney, and partisan gerrymandering. Democrats are proud of the fight we \nheld last night. The strength, eloquence, enthusiasm, and overwhelming \nparticipation of my Democratic colleagues during debate was \nexhilarating and shows the passion we feel about this issue.\n  Facing an uphill battle from the start, we lost the vote. But to have \nnot voted would have been a far greater loss, a loss for our Democratic \nParty, which for generations has stood for voting rights; a loss for \nthe civil rights advocates who have sacrificed so much on this issue; \nand a loss for the American people and what this country stands for. On \nan issue this important, not doing everything we could would have been \nunacceptable.\n  Now, the bromides of the beltway class hold we should not have held a \nvote on voting rights if the outcome was not certain. They are wrong. \nImagine telling Dr. King not to march from Selma to Montgomery because \nhe could not be sure what obstacles awaited him and his fellow freedom \nfighters. Imagine telling John Lewis he should never have crossed the \nPettus Bridge because it was unclear what perils awaited him on the \nother side.\n  Every Member of this body who has ever invoked these great titans of \nfreedom has an obligation--an obligation--to uphold their legacies not \njust with words but with actions. Senators were elected to vote. The \nexamples of Dr. King, of John Lewis inspire us, give us strength, and \nshow us that sometimes the only right option is to move forward.\n  And we need to remember what this is about. With the advent of Donald \nTrump and his many Big Lies, with the January 6 insurrection, with the \nvicious acts of voter suppression throughout the States, and with the \ngreedy dark money interests that fuel the Republican Party these days, \nthis is a fight for the soul of America--nothing less. So Democrats \nwill not shy away from an uphill fight; we will continue to face them.\n  And I believe that the lessons of history are clear: When \nRepresentatives have to take a stand, when they have to show to the \nAmerican people where they are on the issues, the right side of history \nultimately prevails. We know history is on the side of voting rights, \nand we know that forcing leaders to take stands will ultimately move \nthe ball forward.\n  Now, finally, I want to thank all my colleagues who came to the floor \nyesterday to speak valiantly in defense of voting rights and for \nworking assiduously for months on this vital issue: Senators Klobuchar \nand Merkley, Booker, Schatz, Senator Kaine--you, Mr. President--\nSenators King, Tester, Warnock, Ossoff, Durbin, Padilla, Leahy--and so \nmany, so many more. Their leadership, their expertise, and their \ndedication to protecting our democracy is inspiring. It gives our \ncaucus strength, and it made such a difference. Last night was unusual \nand exhilarating because we fought the good fight.\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\n  As former Majority Leader Alben Barkley of Kentucky said 80 years ago \nthis November, facing a filibuster, which successfully blocked anti-\npoll tax legislation--the majority leader, Alben Barkley, from \nKentucky, said:\n\n       I am glad I have made this fight. I have made it in behalf \n     of what I believe to be the broad and true foundations of a \n     true democracy.\n\n  Senate Democrats fighting for voting rights is not over. We will keep \nfighting until voting rights are protected for every single American. \nAnd one day--hopefully, sooner rather than later--we will succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

For 49 years, \nthe March for Life has united people from diverse backgrounds, \ndifferent faiths, and all 50 States to celebrate the dignity of human \nlife and confront the ways our society fails to protect it.\n  This year, the marchers will arrive in a Washington controlled by a \nDemocratic Party that has grown increasingly radical on this issue. \nToday's Democrats work overtime to keep our country one of just seven \nnations on the planet that have abortion on demand even after the \nunborn children can feel pain. Our shameful company includes China and \nNorth Korea. Fewer than 30 percent of Americans endorse this view, but \nDemocrats have made it party dogma.\n  On President Biden's watch, Washington Democrats have even turned \nagainst the longstanding bipartisan Hyde Amendment. Both parties used \nto agree that at least Federal taxpayers should not be forced to fund \nabortions. Now Democrats on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue declared \nwar on even this.\n  So I warmly welcome the marchers from Kentucky and across the \ncountry. This radical version of the Democratic Party needs to hear \nyour voices now more than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Today marks exactly 1 year since President Biden \nbecame our fourty-sixth President. This all-Democratic government has \nhad 365 days to start delivering on some of their core promises.\n  So what were those promises, in their own words? ``Crushing the \nvirus,'' ``strengthen[ing] our alliances,'' and, above all else, \n``lower[ing] the temperature'' and reuniting a divided country.\n  Remember, upon taking office, this administration had historic \ntailwinds at its back. President Biden inherited lifesaving vaccines \nand a distribution system that was already up and running. He inherited \na string of bipartisan rescue packages, including one that was only \njust a few days old. He inherited an economy that was prime for a \nroaring comeback. Those were the promises. That was the inheritance.\n  So let's take a look at the progress report. Last spring, against \nexpert advice, the Biden administration dumped another mountain of \nborrowed cash on an already white-hot economy. As a result, we are now \nbeing hammered by the worst inflation in 40 years. Practically \neverything families need and want have gotten much, much more \nexpensive. Constant shortages disrupt family shopping. Households are \nbeing hit with soaring heating costs if they stay home and soaring gas \nprices if they go out. Our economic trajectory looks shakier today than \nit did when Democrats were sworn in.\n  Of course, we have continued adding back jobs from COVID lockdowns. \nThat was certainly going to happen. But job creation has massively \nunderperformed Democrats' own projections for job creation with their \nsuper costly springtime stimulus package.\n  When 2021 was said and done, the country had added roughly the same \nnumber of jobs that we were on track to create before Democrats \nimplemented one policy or spent one dime. They managed to literally \nblow $1.9 trillion but only barely beat the starting trajectory they \ninherited.\n  They call that spending a COVID package, but less than 10 percent of \nthe money went to the actual medical fight, and that certainly shows.\n  Americans are entering their third year of this pandemic with too few \ntests, too few treatments, too many new cases, and too many school \nclosures; muddled guidance on boosters that caused FDA experts to \nresign in protest, and needless divisive vaccine mandates that were not \neven constitutional.\n  One year in, the coronavirus is decidedly uncrushed.\n  And COVID wasn't the only epidemic sweeping American streets. Take \nviolent crime. Far-left rhetoric and anti-law-enforcement local \npolicies have led major cities to set all-time records for homicide in \n2021.\n  Or take fentanyl. This deadly imported poison was the leading cause \nof death for Americans aged 18 to 45, last year. The No. 1 killer of \nAmericans in their prime--fentanyl.\n  So why aren't Democrats treating this like an emergency? When was the \nlast time President Biden even talked about this?\n  And drug deaths are not the only consequence of our weak borders.\n  Candidate Biden's rhetoric incentivized a historic flood of illegal \nimmigration, and then President Biden's weak policies lit the fuse. The \nresult? The biggest surge in illegal border crossings in 60 years--60 \nyears.\n  All these issues are priorities for American families, but the Biden \nadministration spent most of 2021 focused on none of those. Washington \nDemocrats spent months chasing a reckless taxing-and-spending spree \npacked with far-left policies that citizens never wanted. We spent half \nof 2021 trying and failing to blow $5 trillion on windmills and \nwelfare.\n  When that effort faded, Democrats abruptly pivoted and started \nshouting that American democracy was on death's door. They \npropagandized that some evil anti-voting conspiracy was sweeping \nAmerica, and the only solution to this grand crisis was a gigantic \npartisan election takeover bill that Democrats had conveniently written \nyears before the events which they say now prompted it.\n  The American people didn't buy the fake hysteria. One-half of one \npercent of the country thinks election laws are our top issue. In fact, \nmore Americans believe voting laws are too loose than too tight.\n  Oh, but Democrats went all in on this obsession. A few days ago, the \nsitting President of the United States called millions of Americans his \ndomestic enemies and analogized--analogized--U.S. Senators to Jefferson \nDavis.\n  Well, last night, the fake panic drove 48 Senate Democrats to walk \nthe plank on a failed effort to shatter the Senate itself for short-\nterm power. And now Washington Democrats appear to be launching an \nabsurd and reckless campaign to delegitimize the next election in \nadvance, in case they lose it. Sound familiar?\n  Yesterday, the President told reporters that he might not accept the \n2022 election results as legitimate if his election takeover bills do \nnot pass Congress first. It all sounds eerily familiar.\n  This morning, the House majority whip followed suit. He was asked if \nthe legitimacy of our elections is contingent on Washington Democrats \npassing these bills, and he replied: ``I am absolutely concerned about \nthat.''\n  The Democrats who preached countless sermons about accepting voter \ndecisions are now saying the midterms may be illegitimate, unless they \nwin.\n  So America, after all of this, do you feel unified? Do you feel \nhealed? Do you feel like our core institutions are being protected?\n  Now, Senate Republicans have met this administration more than \nhalfway. In 2021, the Senate built and passed a major infrastructure \nbill. We passed bipartisan legislation on competing with China.\n  But beyond that, this administration deliberately chose to build \ntheir whole\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\ngoverning strategy around the party-line reconciliation process.\n  So the President cannot deflect blame for his disappointing first \nyear. The American people know where the buck stops, and if our \nDemocratic friends do not change course, before long, the buck will \nstop somewhere else.\n  Now, on a related matter, President Biden also campaigned on \nstrengthening America's partnerships and renewing our global \nleadership. Well, how has the administration done?\n  The administration that campaigned on restoring alliances abandoned a \ncoalition of loyal partners with its disastrous and fatal retreat from \nAfghanistan.\n  The Biden administration green-lit Vladimir Putin's Nord Stream 2 \npipeline, and the Democrats blocked us from sanctioning it. This \npipeline will help Putin gain even more leverage over Western Europe \nand, of course, further isolate Ukraine.\n  As we speak--right now--Putin has amassed more than 100,000 Russian \ntroops along the border of Ukraine. If these forces cross into Ukraine, \nit will not be a new invasion or a ``re-invasion.'' It will represent a \nmajor escalation of an ongoing occupation.\n  Ukraine has been fighting a Russian-backed war on its own now for \n8 years. Eight years ago, I tried to warn President Obama that Putin is \nonly deterred when the world imposes real costs--real costs--on his \nmisbehavior.\n\n  But the Biden Administration sent Ukraine nonlethal support, and the \nsanctions it imposed and coordinated proved not to be as tough as \nadvertised. The Obama-Biden administration failed to end Putin's \ninvasion or compel compliance with the Minsk accords. Now the Biden-\nHarris team must not repeat the Obama-Biden grave mistakes.\n  But yesterday, on live television, President Biden telegraphed \npassivity--telegraphed passivity--and weakness, exactly when our allies \ncan least afford it. Our President seemed to state--and, I pray, \nunintentionally--that he expects Putin to escalate in Ukraine, and, in \nany case, Putin can do what he wants.\n  Here is what the President said: ``That decision is totally, solely, \ncompletely a Putin decision. . . . I suspect it matters which side of \nthe bed he gets up on.''\n  What on Earth does that mean?\n  Further, the President said: ``My guess is he will move in.''\n  The President said: ``My guess is he will move in. He has to do \nsomething.''\n  So President Biden thinks Putin has to do something. What does that \neven mean? Why is our President speculating like a passive observer on \nthe sidelines?\n  He isn't a pundit. He isn't Putin's psychoanalyst. He is the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So will America hold Russia accountable if it escalates? Here was the \nmessage from our Commander in Chief: ``It depends on what Russia does. \nIt's one thing if it's a minor incursion''--a minor incursion--``and \nthen we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et \ncetera.''\n  ``It is one thing if it is a minor incursion''? Does this mean \nPresident Biden will not actually authorize the tough response that his \nown administration officials have spent weeks--weeks--promising?\n  This was a moment to deliver a powerful warning to the Kremlin that \nUkraine's sovereignty is inviolable; that we would stand with her \npeople; that the cost of escalation would be devastating.\n  It was a moment to reassure our partners in Kiev and our allies along \nNATO's eastern flank that America had their back.\n  It was a moment to call for NATO's unity, not to expose and appear \nhamstrung by NATO's divisions. It was a bizarre and devastating \nperformance--especially, I would add--for our friends on the \nfrontlines.\n  President Zelensky's Defense Minister has already shot back. This is \nfrom Ukraine's Defense Minister:\n\n       We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with \n     quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This \n     aggression was [already] there since 2014. This is the fact.\n\n  I suspect our own Secretary of State, who is in Europe to meet with \nour allies and the Russian Foreign Minister--was also shocked by what \nthe President had said. Minutes later, White House staff put out a \nfrantic statement laying out a completely different position than what \nPresident Biden had just expressed. By then, of course, significant \ndamage had been done.\n  But, alas, the damage can be undone. The President of the United \nStates is never powerless. President Biden needs to clean up his \nremarks. He needs to clearly state American resolve and clearly \ndemonstrate American leadership. He should call President Zelensky and \nNATO's allies most threatened by Russian aggression. He should rally \nallies and partners around the world to defend Ukraine and the \ninternational system that is being threatened by Putin.\n  His administration should be using every waking moment right now--\nright now--to expedite our delivery of real defensive capabilities to \nUkraine.\n  The President must cut the indecision and redtape that has slowed us \nand our partners down. President Biden should finally, at long last, \nget around to nominating an Ambassador to Ukraine, a position he has \nleft empty for 12 crucial months.\n  He should send U.S. forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank--not if--\nnot if and when Putin escalates, but right now, before it is too late.\n  He should encourage our treaty allies to do likewise. But while \nalliance unity is important, the lowest common denominator of NATO's \nmost nervous members cannot be allowed to restrict American action.\n  Whatever course other nations choose to chart, we cannot afford to \nlet Moscow underestimate our resolve to impose serious--serious--\ncrushing costs in response to any further incursion against Ukraine.\n  Our friends and America's reputation deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Republican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

They provide a \nlistening ear to support a mom going through a difficult time.\n  The March for Life is just one small facet of that work, but it is an \nimportant one because abortion is an injustice that happens behind \nclosed doors. It is not something that we see happening, and so it is \nall too easy to forget that every day in this country, hundreds of \nbabies are being killed by abortion.\n  The CDC reports that almost 630,000 babies were killed by abortion in \n2019 alone--630,000. That number is so big, it is almost unfathomable. \nTo put 630,000 in some kind of perspective, that is equivalent to \nroughly 70 percent of the population of my State of South Dakota killed \nin 1 year--630,000 unique, unrepeatable human beings; future doctors, \nnurses, farmers and teachers and plumbers and busdrivers and research \nscientists, beloved sisters and brothers and nieces and nephews, future \nmoms and dads. That is a lot of lives lost.\n  So events like the March for Life are fundamentally important because \nthey provide a public witness to the truth about abortion. They remind \nall of us of what can be all too easy to minimize or ignore or forget, \nand that is that in this country, we are denying our most vulnerable \ncitizens their most basic right.\n  You would think by now that we would have learned our lesson about \ndeciding that one group of human beings is expendable; about deciding \nthat some human beings are excluded from the protection and dignity \nthat every member of the human family should enjoy. Unfortunately, \nhistory makes clear that great sins are often repeated. But we don't \nhave to stay silent in the face of them. Indeed, we\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nmust not stay silent in the face of them.\n  ``Rescue those being led away to death,'' it says in the Book of \nProverbs. ``[H]old back those staggering towards slaughter. If you say, \n`But we knew nothing about this,' does not he who weighs the heart \nperceive it? . . . Will he not repay everyone according to what they \nhave done?''\n  The March for Life helps make sure that we can never offer the excuse \n``But we knew nothing about this'' and reminds us of our responsibility \nto speak up to rescue the babies in this country who are being led away \nto death mere weeks or months after their life has begun.\n  Those who would defend a supposed right to abortion would like \nAmericans to believe that the decision that legalized abortion in this \ncountry is settled law, but the truth is, it is not. If it were settled \nlaw, the Supreme Court wouldn't regularly be asked to rule on abortion \nlegislation.\n  There is a reason why Roe v. Wade has never taken on the character of \nsettled law, and that is because it was a fundamentally wrongheaded \ndecision; a decision in tension with our most basic beliefs as \nAmericans--that every person is endowed by our Creator with certain \nunalienable rights. Chief among them is the right to life.\n  Americans are not a perfect people. We have made some very grave \nerrors in our past. But Americans are fundamentally a good people. \nWhile we have not always fully realized the promise of our \nDeclaration--the promise of protection for the unalienable rights of \nevery person--it is something we keep fighting for and pursuing.\n  We really believe in the right to life and liberty and to the pursuit \nof happiness, and we have the sentiments to go with that: a strong \nsense of justice, a passion for the right, an instinct to protect the \nvulnerable. So the idea of killing innocent, vulnerable human beings is \nnot something we can easily make our peace with. So it is not \nsurprising to me that, despite the best efforts of the pro-abortion \nmovement, a strong majority of Americans support restrictions on \nabortion.\n  An Associated Press poll from this June found that 65 percent of \nAmericans believe that abortion should generally be illegal in the \nsecond trimester, or from about 13 weeks of pregnancy, while a whopping \n80 percent--80 percent--of Americans believe that abortion should \ngenerally be illegal in the third trimester.\n  Americans know that abortions kill babies. The pro-abortion movement \ncan talk all it wants about blobs of tissue or products of conception; \nscience and technology and common sense point inexorably to the \nhumanity of the unborn child. And Americans know that human beings \ndeserve to be protected even when they are small or weak or \nvulnerable--especially when they are small or weak or vulnerable.\n  It is reprehensible that a country like ours, dedicated to the \ndefense of human rights, has some of the most extreme abortion laws in \nthe world. We are part of just a tiny handful of countries that allow \nelective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Among those other \ncountries are China and North Korea--not exactly the kind of company we \nwant to be keeping when it comes to protecting human rights.\n  It is time for us to do better. We can do better. And I am so \ngrateful for all of the marchers and for all those in the pro-life \nmovement who are out there fighting to ensure that we do better.\n  ``Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,'' it says in \nthe Book of Proverbs. Thank you to all those who are speaking up \ntomorrow. Keep speaking up, and I am confident that sooner or later, \nlife will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 401\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this weekend is the anniversary of the \nlandmark Roe v. Wade decision. It is a decision that, without a doubt, \nchanged lives for the better. It prevented a lot of harm and helped \nkeep many patients healthy. It opened doors for women to pursue their \ncareer and education goals and affirmed the right to control our own \nbodies and our own futures.\n  Roe was a giant leap forward, and a majority of Americans want to \nprotect it. But since Roe was decided, extreme Republicans have peddled \nblatant misinformation, filled our judicial system with anti-abortion \njudges, and passed State laws designed solely to make it harder to get \nabortions--laws that are now hurting people of color, the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity, immigrants, young people, people with low incomes, and \npeople with disabilities the most. And they are not stopping at \nabortion. They are pushing to make it harder to get birth control and \ndefund family planning clinics--including Planned Parenthood--which \nprovide critical healthcare for so many communities.\n  In Texas, Republicans have passed, and the Supreme Court green-lit, a \nlaw that essentially bans abortions and is enforced by pitting neighbor \nagainst neighbor. And even though medication abortion pills are safe to \ntake at home, extreme Republicans are now pushing to pass laws that not \nonly dictate what happens in a doctor's office but also make it harder \nfor patients to take a pill in their very own living room.\n  You know, Republicans do like to talk about Big Government, but \noverriding people's individual decisions and science to dictate what \npeople can do in their own homes sounds like a lot of overreach.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is here with a bill today that has one \ngoal: to make it harder to get abortion care by allowing someone else's \npersonal beliefs, rather than a patient's best interest, to determine a \npatient's care. And that is just one example of the extreme agenda \nRepublicans are pushing, today and every day.\n  I have heard from so many people about the problems and the harm this \nhas caused in their lives. I have heard from many patients who had to \njump through unnecessary or even harmful hoops to get the abortion care \nthey needed: patients who had to endure invasive ultrasounds that were \nmedically unnecessary before they could get an abortion; patients who \nwere harassed going in and out of a clinic; patients who had to drive \nhours or even days to get to the nearest abortion provider or who \nzeroed out their bank account to afford a plane ticket or childcare; \npatients, including many in Texas, who didn't have the means to get the \nabortion care they needed and were forced to stay pregnant when they \ndid not want to be.\n  And then the Supreme Court took on a direct challenge to Roe that \nthreatens the constitutional right to abortion. I have heard nonstop \nfrom people who are very anxious about their future, people who are \nscared and frustrated, people who, like the majority of Americans, want \nto protect Roe, who want to live in a country where everyone can make \ntheir own decisions about pregnancy and parenting--free from political \ninterference.\n  That is exactly why I am fighting so hard to protect the right to \nabortion at the Federal level by passing the Women's Health Protection \nAct. That bill will safeguard Roe and help make its promises a reality \nfor everyone, no matter their ZIP Code, by ensuring their \nconstitutional right to abortion is not undermined by State abortion \nbans and restrictions.\n  But Republican attacks from every angle, like the one we will witness \nnow, means there is no one easy fix.\n  We have got to do everything we can to undo the damage the extreme \nRepublicans have caused in our laws and in our lives. And that is why I \nam fighting so hard for the over-the-counter birth control and to make \nhealth insurance companies follow the law rather than forcing patients \nto pay out of pocket for contraception.\n  It is why I am fighting to make a historic investment in title X \nfamily planning centers, which help make healthcare like birth control, \nSTI screenings, and more available to everyone, regardless of their \nincome.\n  And it is why I am asking for everyone to join me in this fight. It \nis going to take all of us working together to protect reproductive \nrights, and there is no action too small.\n  Share your story. Speak up about what reproductive rights mean to \nyou. Support a local organization helping to get patients the \nreproductive healthcare they need. Work to combat Republicans' \nmisinformation. Fight to pass local and State laws protecting abortion \nrights.\n  And here is something to remember while you do it: It is true that \nextreme Republicans have worked nonstop to roll back progress on \nreproductive rights and that abortion access is at risk like never \nbefore.\n  But this is also true: Since Roe, millions and millions of American \nwomen and men grew up knowing access to abortion is a constitutional \nright. Millions and millions more saw how much Roe opened doors for \nwomen and empowered people to make their own personal decisions about \ntheir body and their future.\n  The vast majority of Americans believe people should be trusted to \nmake their own decisions about whether or not to get an abortion and \nthat whether and when to get pregnant is a personal decision, not a \ndecision that should be made by any politician or taken away from them \nbecause of how much money they have or where they live.\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  We can make this a reality, but we have got to fight for it. That is \nwhat I am doing; that is what I am going to keep doing; and I am very \nglad to have so many people alongside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I guess I am one of those extreme \nRepublicans that believe that a child who sucks their thumb, wiggles \ntheir toes and fingers, feels pain, has a beating heart, has a \nfunctioning nervous system, has DNA that is different than the mom or \nthe dad is a baby.\n  I didn't think that was an extreme position to see a child as self-\nevident. That is a child. Now, I understand Americans are divided on \nwhether children in the womb are convenient or inconvenient, and if \nthey are inconvenient, they can be thrown away as medical waste, but if \nthey are convenient, they are kept.\n  I just think every child is precious, and I think every child should \nbe honored and protected. So I guess that makes me extreme.\n  The bill that I bring today is a bill that just looks at the millions \nand millions and millions of Americans who believe like I do. Many of \nthem work in hospitals, and they joined the healthcare profession and \ngot a medical degree because they wanted to save life. They wanted to \nbe a part of protecting individuals at their most critical times, but \nthey also had this real belief--that is a science-based belief, by the \nway--that a child in the womb is just like a child outside the womb, \nthe only difference is time.\n  Forty weeks ago, you were 40 weeks younger. That child in the womb at \nconception and the child outside the womb is just 40 weeks older, just \nlike you are 40 weeks older than what you were 40 weeks ago. It is \nstill a child.\n  For the millions of Americans who believe like that, we have had \nconscience-protection laws on the books, for a long time. In fact, \nthere are 25 conscience-protection laws on the books in America right \nnow. Many of these have not been controversial. In fact, if we go \nthrough the church amendments, when they were done, they protect the \nconscience rights of individuals and entities that object to performing \nor assisting in the performance of abortions or sterilizations against \ntheir religious beliefs or moral convictions.\n  When that passed, almost 50 years ago now, it passed 92 to 1 in this \nbody. It just wasn't that controversial. We understood that people \ndisagreed on the issue of abortion. And why would you ever compel \nsomeone to be able to perform an abortion when their conscience objects \nto that?\n  In 2004, Congress created the Weldon amendment. It is on all of our \nannual appropriations bills. The Weldon amendment bars Federal \nGovernment, State and local government, and recipients of Federal funds \nfrom discriminating against healthcare entities that refuse to provide, \npay for, or provide coverage or refer for abortions. It has not been \nthat controversial.\n  In fact, it was on the Consolidated Appropriations Act last year, \nwhich passed 92 to 6. This has not been that controversial to be able \nto honor the rights of individuals.\n  Now, there are some things that have changed. Some of these 25 laws \nhave not been enforced. In fact, these 25 conscience protections that \nare on our books right now are dependent on the executive branch to \nactually enforce those laws. If I go back during the Trump \nadministration, they confronted California because California mandated \nthat insurance providers had to provide abortion coverage. Well, that \nis not consistent with our law.\n  And so the administration pushed them and said: No, you can't compel \na religious institution that has a moral objection to abortion in your \nState; you can't make them buy abortion coverage and actually pay into \nthat system--though California is.\n  So the Trump administration said to them: No, you have got to allow \nthose folks to have the option; that is the Federal law. And that was \nin the process of being enforced until this administration took the \nleadership and Xavier Becerra, who was the attorney general of \nCalifornia, then moved to HHS and immediately dropped the suit against \nCalifornia, his old State--curious.\n  So the religious entities don't have any recourse in California \nbecause the executive branch won't enforce it.\n  Let me give you another example. There was an employer, University of \nVermont Medical Center. They were pressed with a lawsuit against them \nfor knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violating the Church \namendments. They had nurses that were there that said: I have a \nconscience issue. I don't want to participate in abortion, and the \nUniversity of Vermont Medical Center would compel them to perform \nabortions or they would lose their job.\n  It is in direct violation of Federal law and the conscience \nprotections. So there was a lawsuit against them to be able to have \nthem actually carry out Federal law.\n  When the Biden administration came in, Xavier Becerra immediately \ndropped that lawsuit. There was no settlement. There was no statement \nabout it. Though it is Federal law that you can't violate someone's \nconscience protections, they said: We are not going to enforce that \nFederal law--though it was in the process of being enforced.\n  So the question is, For religious entities in California or for a \nnurse in Vermont, where do they go? If the entity that is charged under \nFederal law--25 Federal laws, to be exact, to actually allow people to \nhave conscience protections--if that entity says, ``We won't do it,'' \nwhat happens?\n  Well, this bill is very straightforward. It just gives the ability \nfor that individual to be able to press a suit for their own rights.\n  If the Federal Government will not enforce the law, this allows that \nindividual to step up and say: Then, I will then file charges that you \nare in violation of Federal law for this--to protect their rights as a \ncitizen.\n  Quite frankly, it is not any different than what any other citizen \nwould do anywhere else--that if they had some civil violation against \nthem that was clearly in violation of their rights, they would be able \nto go to court and be able to say: My rights have been violated; here \nis the statute. And they would have their day in court.\n  That is not allowed currently in Federal law. It has to be the \nexecutive branch to carry it out. And, as we have learned, it is under \nthe whims of the executive branch whether they are going to carry that \nout or not.\n  But, listen, this is really not that controversial in America. The \nmost recent survey that was done by the Knights of Columbus that \nactually just came out this week asked a question about conscience \nprotections. It was a very straightforward question. And the answer \ncame back: 75 percent of the individuals surveyed said that doctors and \nnurses should not be forced to perform abortions if they have a \nreligious objection.\n  Now, we are very divided on the issue of abortion, but our Nation is \nreally not that divided on the issue of conscience protections. This \nis, Can an employer compel someone to do something that violates their \nreligious beliefs or moral beliefs? And if they don't, they lose their \njob. That is the only question that is in this, and that is why I bring \nit to this body today. That is my simple request.\n  Now, this body knows, and Senator Murray, who is on the floor with me \ntoday, knows full well of my beliefs about the value of every single \nchild. I do look forward to a day that we are post-Roe as a nation and \nthe Supreme Court of the United States is not compelling every State to \nhave abortions carried out that are elective abortions in their State.\n  A post-Roe nation is not a nation that has no abortion. It is a \nnation where, State to State, each State makes those decisions.\n  I have brought bills dealing with everything from chemical abortions \nto 20-week, pain-capable bills dealing with Down syndrome children, \ndealing with Planned Parenthood, dealing with all sorts of different \nissues.\n  This issue today is very specific, though--just about conscientious \nobjectors. Should they be compelled to violate their beliefs by their \nemployer?\n  So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 401 and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third \ntime and\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\npassed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, to the Chair, we will as a nation \nprocess through this in the days ahead. This body has very strict laws \nthat cover my State and many other States for a lot of other things.\n  In my State, if you go to build a building in the southeast part of \nmy State, you have to do frequent inspections to make sure the burying \nbeetle is not going to be harmed in that area because it is considered \nthreatened.\n  If you are in the western part of my State, you can't build certain \nbuildings in certain places or carry out certain farming activities \nbecause the lesser prairie-chicken is there.\n  If you are in California, they pour their water--their great water--\nout of the mountains into the ocean because if they don't, it may harm \nthe smelt.\n  If you are building a bridge in Oklahoma, at certain times of the \nyear, and a migratory bird puts up a nest in that construction area, \nyou have to stop construction, because migratory bird eggs are \nvaluable, burying beetles are valuable, prairie-chickens are valuable, \nsmelts are available, but we throw children in the trash.\n  We have got to figure this out as a nation, and, currently, we seem \nto be afraid to talk about it or even to protect the rights of \nindividuals who disagree about this in the workplace. We have got to \nfigure this out as a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Van Hollen). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"}
