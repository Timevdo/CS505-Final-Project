Madam Speaker, I congratulate and thank the Children's \nHospital of Philadelphia on the opening of their second inpatient \nhospital, in my district, in King of Prussia.\n  CHOP's Middleman Family Pavilion will dedicate more than 250,000 \nsquare feet of space solely to children. In our continued fight with \nCOVID-19, we need more facilities like this one that families from all \nover our region can access.\n  As the first pediatric emergency room in Montgomery County, CHOP will \nensure that more children in Pennsylvania will have timely, nationally \nacclaimed care.\n  The Middleman Family Pavilion will also create many jobs for the \nMontgomery County community, bringing needed jobs to communities like \nNorristown, Bridgeport, and Conshohocken.\n  Now more than ever, with CHOP, it is all about children. That is the \nsame for me. We need healthcare facilities that meet the demands of \ntoday, that treat our children with expert care and our families with \ncompassion.

Mr. Speaker, a lot can happen in a year: a woman \ncan deliver a newborn; a child can learn to walk; and a small virus \nleaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, can go around the globe and cause a \nglobal pandemic.\n  While the first two are joyous, the latter, and the 1-year \nanniversary of the Biden administration, is nothing to celebrate. We \nhave the highest inflation in 40 years, and you don't need a graph to \nshow that. We see it each day when we go to fill up our tank or go to \nthe grocery store.\n  We have the end of American energy independence and a plea to OPEC to \nincrease petroleum production; record-high numbers of illegal border \ncrossings; almost double legal immigration, with no COVID-19 testing; \nrecord-high illegal drug crossings, especially synthetic fentanyl, with \nrecord-high overdoses, especially in our young population, 18 to 45; \nrecord-high homicides and crime in blue States; a disastrous withdrawal \nfrom Afghanistan, Saigon 2.0, with a loss of billions in equipment and \nthe lives of 13 of our servicemen and -women.\n  The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has led to increased \ninstability with Russia and China.\n  We have a vaccine mandate that ignores science, which shows that both \nthe delta virus can transmit, even if vaccinated and boosted, and \nomicron wanes within 1 month.\n  My advice to this administration: End the vaccine mandate; stop what \nyou are doing; and go on vacation.\n\n[[Page H256]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the award of a \nCongressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the Iran hostage crisis \nthat were released, after 444 days of captivity, 41 years ago today.\n  On November 4, 1979, Iranian student militants stormed the U.S. \nEmbassy in Tehran and took Embassy employees captive. Despite mock \nfiring squads, beatings, solitary confinement, lack of food, and \npsychological torture, the American hostages maintained their strength \nand resilience.\n  Back at home, Americans remained united in their support for the \nhostages, many tying yellow ribbons around trees as a sign of \nsolidarity. The former hostages have never received proper recognition \nfrom their government for their sacrifices.\n  This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our Nation's ability to come \ntogether to honor these American heroes. As of today, the bill has over \n166 cosponsors.\n  Special thanks to Commission 52 and Chairman Brock Pierce for helping \nto gather support for the bill. It is a true public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, this week marks 1 year of \nPresident Biden's out-of-touch, reckless, and disastrous Presidency.\n  The past 12 months have been filled with failure after failure, and \nAmericans are dealing with the consequences at every corner.\n  From skyrocketing inflation, increased crime rates, a disastrous \nAfghanistan exit, an open border agenda, concerned parents labeled as \ndomestic terrorists, and more, this administration has failed the \nAmerican people.\n  Amidst all the crises, President Biden has spent a quarter of his \nfirst year in his Delaware basement, avoiding all responsibilities. \nThis is unacceptable from anyone.\n  I came to Congress to serve the people of Texas' 25th Congressional \nDistrict, and when I am back home, I hear firsthand how Texans are \nworse off under President Biden than ever before.\n  The bottom line is, a year of the Biden administration's socialist \nand far-left agenda has dragged our country backward, not forward.\n  It is time America has leaders that put America first. President Joe \nBiden is not that leader. He has 33 percent approval.\n  In God we trust.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Stanton).

Now, we are at over \n80,000.\n  I secondly ask that we convene a bipartisan group to get back down to \n20,000 a month to cross the border.\n  Finally, at the time President Trump was President, he was given a \ncocktail which cured his COVID illness almost immediately. That \ncocktail should be available to all Americans.\n  I, again, encourage a joint conference with us to get together and \ncure the people who get COVID.\n  Finally, Mr. President, stop being so divisive and screaming racism \nright and left.

Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Washington \ncommunities will receive more than $605 million over the next 5 years \nto invest in critical bridge repairs.\n  Last week, Everett officials took me across the Merrill and Ring \nCreek Bridge and told me how this bold, long-term investment will \ncreate jobs, drive economic recovery, and keep people on the move.\n  Mr. Speaker, you cannot have a big-league economy with little-league \ninfrastructure.

He returned to the \nUniversity of Georgia his junior year and earned a starting role.\n  This past season, Stetson Bennett spearheaded the Dawgs to their \nfirst college football national championship in 42 years.

Multiple civic organizations, \nsuch as Kiwanis and MADD, recognized him with many awards.\n  He was also elected as a board member of the Santa Ana Police \nOfficers Association, showing, again, his leadership and his positive \ninfluence on others.\n  As we celebrate Bobby's life, may his example continue to shine for \nthe next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

He fought to pass landmark legislation that \nprotects businesses, taxpayers, the unborn, religious freedoms, and our \nSecond Amendment rights.\n  Under his leadership, the Texas House led on criminal justice reform \nissues, healthcare affordability, police funding, and addressing winter \nstorm Uri's long-term impact on our State.\n  I cannot express how proud we are in Texas 14 to claim Speaker \nPhelan, his wife Kim, and their four precious boys, Ford, Mack, Hank, \nand little Luke, as our own.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Phelan for all he does for Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4673, as amended, my \nbill, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.\n  I have made suicide prevention a top priority for the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. Last Congress, we passed bipartisan, bicameral \nmental health legislative packages, including the Commander John Scott \nHannon Veterans Mental Health Improvement Act and the Veterans COMPACT \nAct. This Congress, we continued this work by passing the Sergeant \nKetchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act into law, but there is always \nmore to do.\n  EVEST builds on our work and finally closes one of the most glaring \ngaps for veterans being able to successfully access high-quality VA \nhealth services, the enrollment process. We shouldn't be trying to hide \nVA care from those who earned it.\n  We know that the months following transition out of the military can \nbe very stressful and particularly risky for new veterans in terms of \nmental health. With the EVEST Act, servicemembers will be automatically \nenrolled in VA care during their transition out of the military, with \nthe choice to opt out. This helps simplify the process and prevents \nveterans from potentially missing out on lifesaving care. It also keeps \nveterans from having to opt into VA care later and attempt to navigate \na new bureaucracy all on their own.\n  The symptoms of PTSD can be significantly improved in veterans who \nreceive prompt mental healthcare. A 2014 study led by researchers at \nthe San Francisco VA Medical Center looked at nearly 40,000 Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans who received VA mental\n\n[[Page H258]]\n\nhealthcare between 2001 and 2011 and had a post-deployment diagnosis of \nPTSD. They found that veterans who sought and received care soon after \nthe end of their service had lower levels of PTSD upon follow-up a year \nafter they initiated care. Each year that a veteran waited to initiate \ntreatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of their \nPTSD either not improving or getting worse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the study from the San Francisco \nVA Medical Center.\n\n                 [From Psychiatric Services, Dec. 2014]\n\n Timing of Mental Health Treatment and PTSD Symptom Improvement Among \n                     Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans\n\n (By Shira Maguen, Ph.D.; Erin Madden, M.P.H.; Thomas C. Neylan, M.D.; \nBeth E. Cohen, M.D., M.A.S.; Daniel Bertenthal, M.P.H.; Karen H. Seal, \n                             M.D., M.P.H.)\n\n\n                               Objective\n\n       This study examined demographic, military, temporal, and \n     logistic variables associated with improvement of \n     posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Iraq and \n     Afghanistan veterans who received mental health outpatient \n     treatment from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     health care system. The authors sought to determine whether \n     time between last deployment and initiating mental health \n     treatment was associated with a lack of improvement in PTSD \n     symptoms.\n\n\n                                Methods\n\n       The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of existing \n     medical records of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who enrolled \n     in VA health care, received a postdeployment PTSD diagnosis, \n     and initiated treatment for one or more mental health \n     problems between October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, and \n     whose records contained results of PTSD screening at the \n     start of treatment and approximately one year later \n     (N=39,690).\n\n\n                                Results\n\n       At the start of treatment, 75% of veterans diagnosed as \n     having PTSD had a positive PTSD screen. At follow-up, 27% of \n     those with a positive screen at baseline had improved, and \n     43% of those with a negative screen at baseline remained \n     negative. A negative PTSD screen at follow-up was associated \n     with female gender, older age, white race, having never \n     married, officer rank, non-Army service, closer proximity to \n     the nearest VA facility, and earlier initiation of treatment \n     after the end of the last deployment.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Interventions to reduce delays in initiating mental health \n     treatment may improve veterans' treatment response. Further \n     studies are needed to test interventions for particular \n     veteran subgroups who were less likely than others to improve \n     with treatment. (Psychiatric Services 65:1414-1419, 2014; \n     doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201300453)\n       Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most \n     common mental disorders among veterans returning from recent \n     deployments. Yet, despite the availability of evidence-based \n     treatments, there are multiple barriers to initiating mental \n     health treatment. Many military personnel and veterans who \n     report barriers to mental health care do not seek treatment \n     or postpone seeking it.\n       Among veterans who do seek mental health care, the time lag \n     is quite significant. In a previous study, we found that \n     recently returning veterans with psychiatric diagnoses had \n     delayed initiating mental health care at the U.S. Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) by a median of over two years after \n     their last deployment ended. Delays in care can translate \n     into delays in symptom and functional improvement, hindering \n     readjustment to civilian life, family, and community.\n       Some studies have examined predictors of PTSD symptom \n     worsening, but outside of randomized treatment trials, only a \n     few studies have examined variables that are associated with \n     PTSD symptom improvement. In other words, few studies have \n     examined variables that are associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement in a naturalistic fashion, by allowing treatment \n     initiation or engagement to vary among participants. \n     Furthermore, even fewer studies have examined these questions \n     among military personnel or veterans, particularly among \n     those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Existing \n     studies have found a few variables that were associated with \n     PTSD symptom improvement. For example, service members \n     serving in multiple deployments demonstrated greater symptom \n     improvement than those serving in a single deployment. For \n     other demographic variables, the association with improvement \n     is unclear. For example, although we know that female gender \n     may be associated with the development of PTSD, it is not \n     clear how gender is related to PTSD symptom improvement.\n       If we can better understand why some individuals improve, \n     we can better understand the course and trajectories of PTSD \n     and how to best contribute to individuals' recovery. This \n     study evaluated demographic, military, temporal, and logistic \n     variables that may be associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement. We were particularly interested in whether \n     seeking mental health treatment sooner was associated with \n     improvement in PTSD symptoms.\n\n\n                                Methods\n\n     Data source and extraction\n       We conducted a retrospective analysis of existing medical \n     records from the VA's Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/\n     Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation New Dawn (OND) \n     roster, a national database of veterans who have separated \n     from OEF/OIF/OND military service and who have enrolled in VA \n     health care. Veterans of OEF served predominantly in \n     Afghanistan, and veterans of OIF and OND served predominantly \n     in Iraq. We linked the OEF/OIF/OND roster database, which \n     contains veterans' demographic and military service \n     information, to the Decision Support System's National Data \n     Extract of pharmacy data and the VA National Patient Care \n     Database, which provides VA visit dates and associated \n     diagnostic codes from the International Classification of \n     Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). \n     These data are derived from electronic medical records \n     generated during clinical visits. Visits to mental health \n     outpatient and primary care services are categorized by \n     clinic stop codes. Mental health outpatient services include \n     visits to integrated care clinics providing primary care and \n     mental health care. Fee basis codes designate care that is \n     rendered at non-VA facilities and reimbursed by the VA but do \n     not capture all non-VA care, such as care reimbursed by \n     private insurance. The results of PTSD screening were \n     extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.\n       All analyses were restricted to OEF/OIF/OND veterans who \n     had received a diagnosis of PTSD (ICD-9-CM code 309.81) \n     during two or more clinical encounters that occurred after \n     the end of their last deployment and before December 31, \n     2012; had utilized mental health outpatient care between \n     October 1, 2007 (beginning of nationwide primary care \n     screenings), and December 31, 2012, and had not made any \n     prior use of VA care; and had received PTSD screenings at \n     both the start of treatment (up to three months before and \n     one month after the first mental health visit) and on at \n     least one other occasion occurring at least one year later \n     (N=39,690). Of veterans who newly entered mental health \n     treatment, 83% had a baseline screen for PTSD, and of those \n     with a baseline screen, 50% had a follow-up screen during the \n     period beginning one year later. The follow-up screen that \n     was closest in proximity to the one-year follow-up date was \n     utilized.\n     Measures\n       PTSD symptoms were assessed by using the Primary Care PTSD \n     Screen (PC-PTSD), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), or both. Both \n     measures were included in order to capture the most \n     representative sample, given that the PC-PTSD screen is \n     mainly used in VA primary care settings and other non-mental \n     health settings and the PCL is used primarily in VA mental \n     health settings. The PC-PTSD, a brief four-item screen given \n     annually and after each deployment, is designed to detect \n     possible PTSD symptoms. The screen yields binary responses \n     (yes or no) for each of four PTSD symptom clusters: \n     reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and \n     hyperarousal; a score of \u001c3 designates a positive PTSD screen \n     for veterans.\n       The PCL is a 17-item measure, with each item rating the \n     presence of a different symptom over the past month on a 5-\n     point Likert scale, from not at all to a little bit, \n     moderately, quite a bit, and extremely. The PCL has been \n     shown to have very good internal consistency, and it \n     correlates strongly with other measures of PTSD symptoms. The \n     PCL also demonstrates high diagnostic efficiency (.90). \n     Within the VA, the PCL is mainly administered at the \n     discretion of treating clinicians, typically to track patient \n     progress during the course of mental health treatment. For \n     the purposes of this study, symptoms rated as moderately or \n     above on the PCL were considered present. PTSD symptoms from \n     the PCL were combined in order to create indicators that \n     paralleled each of the four symptom cluster proxies from the \n     PC-PTSD. The validity of the mapping of PCL questions onto \n     PC-PTSD items was tested by examining concordance between the \n     two screens given at the VA on the same date. For the \n     purposes of validation, all OEF/OIF/OND veterans who were \n     administered the PCL and the PC-PTSD on the same date (not \n     restricted to our study sample) were included (N=53,756), \n     with a total of 57,889 instances in which a given veteran had \n     both a PC-PTSD and PCL administered on the same day. [A table \n     describing the mapping of the PCL to the PC-PTSD and \n     agreement between the two instruments is available online as \n     a data supplement to this article.]\n       We created a composite variable, referred to as the PTSD \n     screen result; endorsing three or more symptoms on either \n     measure constituted a positive screen for PTSD.\n     Dependent variable\n       The binary dependent variable, a negative (versus positive) \n     PTSD screen result, was defined as a score of <3 at follow-up \n     on the PTSD screen. This outcome comprised PTSD screen \n     results that had improved or had remained negative compared \n     with baseline results (versus having worsened or remained \n     positive).\n     Independent variables\n       The main independent variable was time until initiation of \n     mental health outpatient treatment, which was defined for \n     each person as the time (in years) from the end of the last \n     deployment until the first mental health\n\n[[Page H259]]\n\n     outpatient visit. Other independent variables included date \n     of birth, gender, race-ethnicity, marital status, and \n     military characteristics. Details about each person's \n     military characteristics (armed forces branch [Army, Marines, \n     Navy or Coast Guard, or Air Force], rank, component type \n     [National Guard and reserves or active duty], and number of \n     deployments [one or multiple deployments]) were extracted \n     from the OEF/OIF/OND roster. Information about the type of \n     VA facility nearest to the individual and the distance to \n     the closest facility was derived from the OEF/OIF/OND \n     roster by the VA planning and system support group.\n       The following independent variables were treated as \n     potential confounders because each could account for change \n     in PTSD symptoms: mental health outpatient treatment \n     utilization, defined as the number of mental health clinic \n     visits between the start of mental health treatment and the \n     follow-up screen; regular use of primary care services, \n     defined as a mean interval between visits of six months or \n     fewer; and use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor \n     (SSRI) for 12 consecutive weeks or more, as encoded in VA \n     outpatient pharmacy data.\n     Analysis\n       We used logistic regression analysis to examine the \n     association of independent predictor variables with a \n     negative PTSD screen result. In separate logistic regression \n     models, we examined predictors of PTSD screen results for \n     each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing, \n     avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal). The main \n     predictors of interest included time from the end of the last \n     deployment to initiation of mental health outpatient \n     treatment, gender, age, race-ethnicity, marital status, \n     military component, rank, branch, number of deployments, and \n     distance to and type of nearest VA facility. The multi-\n     variable analysis adjusted for potential confounders of the \n     association between changes in PTSD symptoms and predictors. \n     Potential confounders included baseline PTSD screen result, \n     timing of follow-up screen, regular utilization of primary \n     care services, total mental health outpatient treatment \n     utilization, and SSRI use. Primary care and mental health \n     service utilization and antidepressant use were included only \n     for adjustment purposes because of potential biases due to \n     confounding by indication. More specifically, persons who are \n     more symptomatic are more likely to utilize health services \n     and antidepressant medications.\n       We tested interactions of demographic and military \n     predictors with each other and, separately, with time to \n     initiation of mental health outpatient treatment. As \n     mentioned above, the study combined results for veterans \n     whose PTSD screen result had improved from baseline with \n     those for veterans whose screen result had remained negative. \n     To determine whether it was valid to combine these scores, we \n     tested interactions of baseline screen results with \n     demographic and military factors and, separately, with time \n     from the end of the last deployment to initiation of mental \n     health outpatient treatment. All tests were two-tailed. \n     Analyses were performed by using SAS, version 9.3. The study \n     was approved by the Committee on Human Research, University \n     of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco VA \n     Medical Center.\n\n\n                                RESULTS\n\n       The sample was 90% male, with a mean<plus-minus>SD age of \n     30.5<plus-minus>8.16; 57% were white, 11% were black, 11% \n     were Hispanic, and 21% were of other or unknown race-\n     ethnicity. At the time of initiation of mental health \n     outpatient treatment, 75% of the veterans screened positive \n     for PTSD, having endorsed at least three of the four PTSD \n     symptom clusters on the PTSD screen (Table 1). After at least \n     one year (mean follow-up=2.37<plus-minus>.93 years), 27% \n     (N=7,908) of those with a positive screen at baseline had \n     improved, and 43% (N=4,329) of those with a negative screen \n     at baseline continued to screen negative.\n       Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the \n     following characteristics were associated with a negative \n     PTSD screen result: women compared with men, older versus \n     younger age at first mental health outpatient visit, officer \n     rank compared with enlisted rank, service in branches of the \n     military other than the Army, and negative PTSD screen at \n     baseline (Table 2).\n       Blacks were less likely than whites to have a negative \n     screen result (Table 2), and this difference persisted after \n     adjustment for time from the end of the last deployment to \n     mental health outpatient treatment. Similar to findings of \n     previous studies, the median interval between the end of the \n     last deployment and the use of services was about three \n     months longer for blacks than for whites (p<.001; data not \n     shown). The reduced likelihood among blacks versus whites of \n     a negative PTSD screen result was partly driven by the 7% \n     greater probability that blacks would screen positive for \n     PTSD at follow-up after having screened negative at baseline \n     (p<.001; results not shown).\n       Veterans who were married were slightly less likely than \n     those who were never married to have a negative PTSD screen \n     result. Veterans who lived more than ten miles away from the \n     nearest VA facility were less likely than veterans who lived \n     closer to have a negative screen result. Veterans who lived \n     closer to a community-based outpatient clinic than to a VA \n     medical center were also less likely to have a negative \n     screen result.\n       Notably, veterans who waited longer to initiate mental \n     health outpatient treatment were less likely to have a \n     negative screen result. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing \n     probability of a negative screen result with each year that \n     passed after the end of the last deployment.\n       Logistic regression analyses found similar patterns of \n     association between predictor variables and PTSD screen \n     results for each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (results \n     not shown).\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       A number of demographic, military, temporal, and logistic \n     variables were associated with symptom improvement or with \n     continuing to score below the threshold for a positive PTSD \n     screen. Although temporal variables are rarely examined, we \n     found that greater time to mental health outpatient treatment \n     engagement was negatively associated with PTSD symptom \n     improvement. More specifically, veterans who waited longer to \n     get mental health treatment were less likely than veterans \n     who sought treatment sooner to experience PTSD symptom \n     improvement during the study period. This finding sheds light \n     on the importance of continuing to better understand barriers \n     to mental health treatment, particularly given that less than \n     half of veterans with mental health problems seek care and \n     those who seek care do so after significant delays.\n       Outreach efforts to help veterans engage in treatment in a \n     timely manner are critical and may, in turn, help with PTSD \n     symptom improvement over time. Intervening early when mental \n     health problems are first detected should be a priority. \n     Given that integrated primary and mental health care is now \n     becoming available at many VA health care facilities, this \n     ``one-stop shop'' model provides an optimal way to decrease \n     time to seeking mental health care. Veterans in primary \n     care who screen positive for any mental health problems \n     can receive immediate mental health assistance within an \n     integrated care model, which may assist with the stigma of \n     receiving care in a mental health setting. Indeed, \n     veterans who received integrated primary care were more \n     likely to receive a mental health evaluation or care \n     within a month.\n       We also found that female gender was associated with \n     greater PTSD symptom improvement compared with male gender. \n     Although civilian studies found that females are at greater \n     risk of PTSD, findings in military samples have been mixed, \n     with some studies finding no gender differences. In addition, \n     we recently found that although both genders experienced a \n     delay in engaging in minimally adequate mental health care \n     (eight mental health outpatient visits within a year), female \n     veterans received minimally adequate mental health care about \n     two years sooner than male veterans, which may explain why \n     they achieved greater symptom improvement.\n       Black veterans were less likely, but only modestly so, to \n     demonstrate PTSD symptom improvement, compared with their \n     white counterparts, and this difference was not explained by \n     longer time from the end of the last deployment to mental \n     health outpatient treatment initiation. That is not \n     surprising, given that studies have consistently found that \n     unmet treatment needs are greatest in underserved groups, \n     including racial-ethnic minority groups). It may be that \n     veterans from racial-ethnic minority groups face particular \n     barriers to treatment that are important to acknowledge, and \n     more research is needed in this area in order to optimize \n     outcomes. Furthermore, other variables, such as differential \n     rates of traumatic stressors and preexisting conditions, are \n     important to further explore and may explain some of these \n     differences.\n       Officers were more likely than enlisted personnel to \n     experience PTSD symptom improvement. One possible explanation \n     is that officer status may be a proxy for higher education; \n     research has shown that lower levels of education are \n     associated with chronic trajectories of PTSD. However, other \n     variables that we were not able to measure, such as social \n     support in the aftermath of trauma, may also explain some of \n     these findings.\n       A number of limitations should be considered when \n     interpreting these findings. First, this study was conducted \n     with a population of treatment-seeking veterans who had at \n     least one visit to a VA health care facility. Therefore, our \n     results should not be generalized to all OEF/OIF/OND military \n     personnel or veterans. Second, we selected a population of \n     veterans who served in support of OEF/OIF/OND, and, \n     therefore, these results should not be generalized to \n     veterans of other eras or to veterans from other countries. \n     Third, ICD-9-CM diagnoses were acquired from administrative \n     health records and were not verified with standardized \n     diagnostic measures. A related concern is the combined use of \n     two separate validated tools, the PCL and the PC-PTSD. We \n     used both the PCL and the PC-PTSD in order to obtain the most \n     representative sample and because they are the measures used \n     by the VA system. Furthermore, we found that the method we \n     used was statistically reliable. Nonetheless, combining two \n     separate validated tools may have resulted in variations in \n     these data. Future studies should continue to examine the \n     validity and reliability of this method.\n       Fourth, because of the ways in which data appear in the VA \n     administrative database, we were not able to distinguish \n     between the types of mental health treatments that veterans \n     were receiving, such as evidence-based treatment for PTSD or \n     other mental health\n\n[[Page H260]]\n\n     problems versus supportive therapy; rather, we could account \n     only for number of visits. We hope to have better indicators \n     of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in the future so that \n     the particular types of care that veterans receive can be \n     examined more closely in relation to symptom improvement. \n     Fifth, because we used administrative data, we were not able \n     to examine third variables that may be associated with our \n     outcome, including severe avoidance symptoms, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and poor attachment, among others. Finally, we \n     were able to include only veterans whose PTSD symptoms were \n     measured during at least two occasions; those who dropped out \n     after one visit are not as well represented.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Veterans who waited longer to get mental health treatment \n     were less likely to experience PTSD symptom improvement \n     during the study period. Furthermore, improving barriers for \n     black, male, younger, rural, lower-ranking, and possibly less \n     well educated veterans is an important priority, given our \n     findings. Models that integrate primary care and mental \n     health care may be an optimal way to help expedite veteran \n     treatment engagement.\n\n\n                    Acknowledgments and disclosures\n\n       This research was supported by VA Health Services Research \n     and Development Service (HSR&D) Career Development Award (RCD \n     06-042) to Dr. Maguen, an HSR&D Service Directed Research \n     Award (SDR-08-408) to Dr. Seal, and a Department of Defense \n     Mental Health Research Infrastructure Award (W81XWH-11-2-\n     0189) to Dr. Neylan.

A smooth care transition from DOD to VA can help support \nveterans as they adjust to the next phase of their lives and provide \neasy access to healthcare should any challenges arise.\n  Everyday Americans find it difficult and frustrating to sign up for \nhealthcare. Now, imagine that you have just come off Active-Duty \nmilitary service where, for years you were told when and where to show \nup for your healthcare. You probably heard something about VA services \nduring your transition assistance program but, frankly, you were \nfocused on everything you had to do to finalize your separation from \nthe military and possibly looking for new employment and relocating \nyour family.\n  Now, after having separated from the military, you are a veteran, and \nmaybe for the first time you have to figure out how to check your \neligibility for VA healthcare and navigate the system while potentially \nalso facing some new stress in your personal and family life. This is \ncompletely avoidable with EVEST, which simply enrolls you in the VA \nhealthcare for which you are already eligible, ensuring that when you \nneed VA, there aren't any unnecessary roadblocks to seeing a doctor.\n  Now, let me say that again. This legislation has nothing to do with a \nveteran's eligibility, nor does it change VA standards or who is \neligible. It only connects eligible veterans to VA care faster and \neasier.\n  We know that veterans are much more likely to use VA services and \ncare when the process to enroll is simple, and we know that VA care is \nworld class. EVEST is a straightforward tool that will allow us to \nsimplify the transition process and take steps toward preventing \nveteran suicide.\n  Automatic enrollment is something policymakers and veterans service \norganizations and stakeholders have been trying to advance for years, \nand with EVEST it will finally become a reality.\n  Paralyzed Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans have \nformally endorsed this legislation. The Nurses Organization of Veterans \nAffairs, the American Federation of Government Employees, the Veterans \nHealthcare Policy Institute, and the American Psychological Association \nalso support EVEST.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from \nthe Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs and the Veterans Healthcare \nPolicy Institute.\n                                            Nurses Organization of\n\n\n                                             Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                                 January 14, 2021.\n     Chairman Mark Takano,\n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Takano: On behalf of the nearly 3,000 members \n     of the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA) we \n     would like to offer our strong support for your bill, H.R. \n     4673, Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST).\n       As nurses, caring for Veterans is our number one priority. \n     Your bill will provide Veterans with the option of enrolling \n     in VA healthcare during the critical months following their \n     transition to civilian life and ensure servicemembers \n     separating from active duty receive the critical health care \n     to which they are eligible.\n       Your bill will also help eliminate barriers to care--\n     including those who may not know they are even eligible to \n     receive care at VA. It will also help to assure the Veteran \n     that they are not alone in seeking care for any physical or \n     mental health condition acquired during their military \n     service.\n       Offering automatic enrollment with an opt out will help to \n     lessen the burden of navigating the VA healthcare system at a \n     time when they are dealing with many challenges as they \n     transition to civilian life.\n       NOVA believes that most Veterans will find care provided \n     them within the VA is suited to their individual and complex \n     needs and cannot be matched in the private sector. Many \n     providers at the VA are Veterans themselves so they \n     understand what it means to serve and are trained to provide \n     a Whole Health approach to the Veteran patients' health and \n     well-being.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue and your \n     continued support for Veterans and the healthcare \n     professionals who care for them.\n           Sincerely,\n     Taryn-Janae Wilcox-Olson, MHS, RN,\n       President, Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs (NOVA).\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Veterans Healthcare\n\n\n                                      Policy Institute (VHPI),\n\n                                                 January 19, 2022.\n     Endorsement of the ``Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition \n         Act''\n       The Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute (VHPI) is pleased \n     to formally endorse House bill H.R. 4673, the ``Ensuring \n     Veterans' Smooth Transition Act'' or ``EVEST Act.'' The EVEST \n     Act creates a process to automatically enroll Veterans who \n     are eligible, upon their discharge from the military, into \n     the VA for medical care, with an opportunity to opt out. Many \n     Veterans do not receive the health care they have earned \n     through their service because they are unaware of their \n     eligibility or are too overwhelmed during the complex period \n     of transitioning from active duty. By automatically enrolling \n     Veterans into the VA system, many more eligible veterans will \n     be able to utilize valuable VA health care benefits. Many \n     lives will be saved.\n       This is one of the most important bills in many years, and \n     we are pleased to support its passage.\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader \nHoyer for considering this legislation today, and I urge the rest of my \ncolleagues to support this vital legislation to increase access to care \nand ensure a smooth transition to civilian life for veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4673, the Ensuring \nVeterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.\n  This bill would require VA to automatically enroll every eligible \nseparating servicemember into the VA healthcare system. As a veteran, I \nknow firsthand that the transition from military to civilian life can \nbe hard. One of the goals is to remove barriers to care for veterans, \nwhether they left the military decades ago or just last week.\n  I believe the intention of the EVEST Act is to further that goal by \nconnecting more at-risk servicemembers with the VA as they leave the \nservice. I support the intention. I know many other Members do as well, \nwhich is why I expect the bill to pass the House, and probably on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  However, as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nhave a different perspective on this bill than many of my colleagues. I \nhave taken a long, hard look at this legislation, and what I have seen \nis a bill that may be well intended but has several potential problems.\n  To start with, the EVEST Act enrolls separating servicemembers into \nthe VA healthcare system without their knowledge or consent. Only after \nthey have been enrolled does the bill require VA to inform the veterans \nof their enrollment, the status of their enrollment, and how to opt out \nby disenrolling themselves.\n  We shouldn't be signing veterans up for a government program they \naren't asking for and may never need without at least letting them know \nfirst. And\n\n[[Page H261]]\n\nwe shouldn't be telling them that if they don't like it, they can \nfigure out how to disenroll themselves. That is backwards.\n  Veterans deserve better than that. Veterans also deserve better than \na bill that has been rushed through Congress without due diligence. \nThere has never been a single hearing on the EVEST Act in this \nCongress.\n  You may hear the chairman say that there has been a hearing on this \nbill last Congress. That is true. But last Congress and this Congress \nare very different. We had a different administration last Congress; we \nhad a different VA Secretary last Congress. I believe more than 70 \nMembers are new this Congress. More than half of the membership of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee is new as well. And, regardless, VA did not \nprovide testimony at the hearing last Congress.\n  We have no idea if VA can implement the bill without disrupting \nservice to the veterans already in the VA health system, further \nburdening VA's already overworked staff, or increasing the strain on \nVA's already overfull facilities. Every Member of the House hears from \nveterans in our districts who are waiting too long for care they need, \nstuck in crowded VA facilities, and being treated by VA staff who are \nstruggling and overwhelmed. I am concerned that this bill could make \neach of those things worse.\n  I am not the only one who thinks so. Last week, right before this \nbill was considered by the Rules Committee, the Biden administration \nissued a Statement of Administration Policy on the EVEST Act. The \nstatement reads, ``There may be challenges implementing this bill as \ndrafted, and the administration looks forward to working with Congress. \n. . .'' In other words, even the President recognizes that this bill \nneeds more work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nH.R. 1836--Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021--Rep. Levin, D-\n                    California, and nine cosponsors\n\n   H.R. 4673--Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition (EVEST) Act--Rep. \n                          Takano, D-California\n\n       The Biden-Harris Administration supports efforts that \n     ensure veterans receive timely access to high-quality \n     benefits and services that they have earned.\n       The Administration supports H.R. 1836, which would expand \n     eligibility criteria for certain education benefits. Current \n     law defines the term ``active duty'' as those individuals who \n     are on full-time duty in the active military service of the \n     United States, including full-time training duty, annual \n     training duty, and attendance, while in the active military \n     service, at a school designated as a service school by law or \n     by the Secretary of the military department concerned. H.R. \n     1836 would expand eligibility criteria to include those \n     training in full-time National Guard duty, which includes the \n     National Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air National \n     Guard, as well as those same members when performing active \n     duty.\n       The Administration supports the EVEST Act's goal of \n     seamless enrollment in health care coverage. As currently \n     written, H.R. 4673 would require the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll new veterans into VA \n     health care, and notify veterans of their enrollment and \n     instructions on how to un-enroll, if desired. There may be \n     challenges implementing this bill as drafted, and the \n     Administration looks forward to working with Congress on how \n     best to operationalize its objective.\n\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, to be clear, the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nhad numerous opportunities in the last year to do that work that I had \njust discussed, and I don't know why the chairman chose not to. I have \nheard him say over the last week that it is okay we didn't have a \nhearing on the EVEST Act in this Congress because the bill has been in \nthe public domain.\n  Now, I am not sure what that statement really means because there \nhave been almost 400 bills introduced in this Congress that have been \nreferred to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I guess that each of those \nare in the public domain. But I don't think any of them are ready for a \nvote here on the House floor.\n  It is not too much to ask that we seek the input from stakeholders \nbefore voting on a bill to become law. That is actually the least we \ncan do. I don't think our constituents sent us here to do anything less \nthan that.\n  During last week's Rules Committee, Congresswoman Torres, a member of \nChairman Takano's own party, seemed to agree with me by lamenting the \nlack of process this bill has received this Congress. With all due \nrespect to the Congresswoman, I doubt that we agree on much, but we do \nagree on this, though. Having this bill go through a much more robust \nprocess this Congress could have resulted in a much better product for \nour veterans.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Finally, I want to note that the bill will also cost taxpayers $3.1 \nbillion in new discretionary spending. Not a penny of that $3.1 billion \nis offset.\n  Implementing this bill will certainly require additional funding \nabove the nearly $100 billion already appropriated for the VA \nhealthcare system.\n  We cannot keep saddling our children and grandchildren with billions \nof dollars more debt. We have to do better than this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that I understand why my colleagues will \nlikely vote for this bill. I wish I could vote for this bill, as well.\n  Leaving the military was not easy. It can leave new veterans feeling \nadrift and alone. I have been there. But that is why I supported \nefforts during the Trump administration to improve the Transition \nAssistance Program and increase the VA's outreach to separating \nservicemembers during their first year out of uniform.\n  I want separating servicemembers who need additional support to be \nable to get it and the help they need in a seamless manner. And I am \nnot at all confident that this bill will accomplish that goal without \nharming services to other veterans and adding to the national debt. As \na result, I must oppose this bill today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I reiterate that we should not be hiding the care that our veterans \nhave earned. Let me quickly say that this bill has been in the public \ndomain for 2 years. It was reintroduced last summer, and the minority \nhad over 6 months to talk with us and the VA about it.\n  Furthermore, the committee has held six hearings on suicide \nprevention and transition since 2019. The common sense of this bill \nshines through.\n  And let me also add that regarding the capacity of VA--and I am glad \nthat the ranking member has entered the statement of administrative \nsupport into the Record; that statement clearly says and declares the \nadministration's support and its willingness to work with the \nadministration.\n  Data shows that VA enrollment has been going down in recent years, \nand while new enrollment hovers around 400,000 per year, it used to be \ndouble that, around one million per year, and using current \nassumptions, VA projects veteran enrollment in VHA to remain relatively \nsteady from 2019 to 2029.\n  I am very confident about VA's ability to absorb the additional \nveterans that will take advantage of VA's world-class healthcare.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nMrvan), my good friend and a member of the House Committee on Veterans \nAffairs and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology \nModernization.\n  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for yielding me the time.\n  It is my honor today to rise in support of H.R. 4673, the Ensuring \nVeterans' Smooth Transition Act.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Takano to advance this \ncritical legislation that will require the VA to automatically enroll \nindividuals who are separating from the military into the VA system.\n  Our brave members of the military put their lives and health on the \nline every day to keep our Nation safe, defend our democracy, and \nprotect our freedoms.\n  We have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible for them to \ntransition from military service to civilian life, and I am pleased \nthat this legislation does just that.\n  My life experiences have afforded me the opportunity as a former \ntownship trustee in northwest Indiana to work every day with the \nveterans community. I was able to initiate a veterans services \nroundtable and bring together veteran organizations to discuss, \ncoordinate, and streamline much-needed resources to our veterans.\n\n[[Page H262]]\n\n  In many instances, it was not that the resources or the benefit was \nunavailable, but rather, the individual was unaware of the existing \nbenefit, or unable to access, for whatever reason, the very resource \nthey needed.\n  Today, I am thinking of those countless discussions and individuals \nas I will vote to support the EVEST Act. It is an effective proposal to \nhelp ensure that veterans access the valuable healthcare services \navailable to them during this transition process from active to veteran \nstatus.\n  Today, I want to make sure we meet our veterans' mental health needs \nand increase veterans' access to healthcare. I again thank Chairman \nTakano and my fellow members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nyour commitment to supporting veterans and bringing this measure to the \nfloor today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In response to the EVEST Act has been in the public domain, I think \nit is very important to note, as I mentioned earlier, the last Congress \nis not the same as this Congress. We have more than 70 Members who are \nnew Members of Congress, half of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is \nnew, we have a different President, and we have a different secretary.\n  Introducing a bill is not the same as conducting a hearing. You can't \nget input from the stakeholders. You can't engage in meaningful debate \nin the public domain. This reflects zero input from the VA, meaning we \nhave no idea whether it is flexible, whether it is workable, whether it \nis disruptive to the VA system. We don't know.\n  And even the Biden administration agrees that more work is needed \nbefore this bill should become law.\n  And the previous speaker, Mr. Speaker, spoke about the person that \ndidn't know what was available to them through the VA. If you were my \nage as a veteran it is true that you could not know because you got a \nquick class and the TAP program. And I have mentioned on this floor \nbefore that that is a tap on the back and see you later.\n  But today's TAP program is a course that you take, and you are bound \nto understand separation from your active service and what VA benefits \nare available to you.\n  And not only that, the Trump administration in 2018 put an \nadministrative order out that you are then contacted after separation \nat 90, 180, and 360 days out to be notified of what benefits are \navailable to you in the VA. We are doing that.\n  This instead enrolls members without their consent, and then they are \nenrolled. And the only option they have is to be notified later how \nmaybe they can get out of being enrolled.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to add that, in response to the esteemed ranking member, VA \nformally supports this legislation and has been discussing auto \nenrollment for years.\n  VA has already been working to make transition into VA healthcare \nsmoother with Solid Start and will soon have data showing that warm \nhandoffs have a positive impact on veteran outcomes without \noverwhelming the VA system.\n  In response to the criticism that VSOs have not had input, I want to \npoint out that VSOs, including Paralyzed Veterans of America and \nDisabled American Veterans, have already formally endorsed EVEST. Why? \nBecause the common sense of this legislation shines through.\n  All VSOs have had a chance to weigh in, and many did. The Nurses \nOrganization of Veterans Affairs, the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, the Veterans Health Policy Institute, and the American \nPsychological Association also support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCorrea), my good friend and a former member of the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee who now serves on the Agriculture Committee, Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the EVEST \nAct.\n  All gave some, and many made the ultimate sacrifice. America has made \na promise to our veterans that we will take care of them when they \nreturn home.\n  I represent Orange County, California, and many of my constituents \nhave served their country proudly. One of my constituents, Billy Hall, \nfrom the city of Orange, enlisted at the age of 15, served from 1941 to \n1945 in World War II, and again from 1948 to 1967 in the Korean and \nVietnam wars.\n  Every servicemember deserves our respect and gratitude, and most of \nall, all the benefits and care that we promised them when they would \nreturn home.\n  This bill is very simple but very important. It automatically enrolls \nveterans in the healthcare system. It provides veterans healthcare \nwithout the red tape.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the EVEST Act and pass this \nsimple and important commonsense legislation for our veterans.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In my debate and the things that I brought up here today, I never \nsaid that VSOs didn't have input. I did say the VA did not come to the \ncommittee, and we did not have the proper hearings. If the VA is in \nsupport of this bill, I would request that the VA send the \ndocumentation saying how they are in support of this bill. Their input \nwould be vitally important.\n  Whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration, the VA is \nvitally important to make sure they provide services to our \nconstituents and to our veterans.\n  No one on this floor cares more about veterans than the people who \nserve on this committee--I can guarantee you that--whether it is the \nchairman or myself.\n  But we have to make sure what we are providing does what it is we are \ntrying to do. It was mentioned earlier that they believe that this \nwould help reduce suicide among transitioning servicemembers. I care \ndeeply about this. This is something that both I and the chairman have \nworked on and will continue to work on.\n  The majority of veterans who die of suicide have not had meaningful \nengagement with the VA. They may have been enrolled in the VA, but they \nhaven't gotten the VA care that they need.\n  This bill would add names of eligible separating servicemembers from \nthe VA and put them on the rolls, but it doesn't do the outreach that \nis necessary to possibly prevent them from that ultimate decision to \nend their lives.\n  Those are the type of things we are working on and will continue to \nwork on. This is not the answer to that. There are a lot of other \nconcerns that I have expressed and will continue to express.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me say that the amendments that we are considering to this bill \ntoday, which I consider friendly, will address many of the ranking \nmember's concerns about the reaching out.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), my \ngood friend who serves on the Financial Services Committee and the \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for moving this very \nimportant legislation.\n  In this polarized and angry time, one of the lights of this \ninstitution is that we have always come together to better serve our \nveterans, to better serve those men and women who took the ultimate \nrisk and were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of all \nof us and the system that this room embodies.\n  And this is a real problem. As I go around my district and I talk to \nyoung veterans, they face any number of transitional issues; with \nhousing, with healthcare. And let's face it, the change from being on \nactive duty to being a veteran is a challenging one, one that all too \noften results in the kind of tragedy that we have acknowledged here in \nthis Chamber today.\n\n[[Page H263]]\n\n  And so I rise in strong support of the EVEST Act. It is consistent \nwith something that I am very proud to have accomplished many years ago \nwhen we passed the SERVE Act, which made it easier for veterans to show \nthat they had an income so that they could get the housing which they \nwere entitled to. It was a small thing, but it just eased the passage \nfor those young men and women who have so well served this country.\n  This is important, and it is not a big deal, but it is going to \naffect tens of thousands of veterans. My Republican friends know that I \nrespect and value their input and their objections to our ideas. It \nmakes us better when you pose objections to our ideas. But I am a \nlittle puzzled by the objections that I am hearing today.\n  I have heard sitting here that this is not paid for. Okay. It is $3 \nbillion that I think is well spent on perhaps the most valuable \npopulation that we have. But the notion that it is not paid for, let's \nremember it was just a couple years ago that my friends on the \nRepublican side passed $2 trillion in tax cuts, 83 percent of which \nbenefited the top 1 percent of this country's citizens. I have to \nbelieve that if we can do $2 trillion in tax cuts that largely benefits \nthe richest Americans, that we can find $3 billion to ease the passage \nfor our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I have heard the ranking member say that the VA maybe can't handle \nit. Let's remember that the VA supports this idea and that we are just \nasking them to do a little bit more of what they already do. This is \nnot some new and fanciful program. No, it is making a program that is \nwell-established available to more.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I am particularly proud of my \nfriend and neighbor--  Joe Courtney will talk about this shortly--that \nmy neighbor, Jahana Hayes, is proposing an amendment that will increase \nthe notification that goes to veterans about what is available to them.\n  This bill needs to pass because, at the end of the day, we are \nanswering the question: Do we want more veterans to have access to what \nwe have promised them, or do we want fewer veterans to have access to \nwhat we have promised them? That is what is at stake here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and urge him to rethink his \nobjections to this bill because this will be a proud moment when this \nbill passes.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs did \nnot do our job on this bill. We did not consider this bill in a \nlegislative hearing. We did not seek input from stakeholders or the VA. \nWe did not make certain that automatically enrolling newly separated \nservicemembers into the VA healthcare system would not impede access \nfor existing employees or cause funding crises. And those things are \nvery, very real.\n  Even the Biden OMB has admitted that there are going to be challenges \nwith implementing this bill. If you look at the numbers--and I am going \nto add this into what should be mentioned--19.1 million veterans is \nwhat we have; 9 million veterans are enrolled; 7 million have used \naccess to the VA. If we start and do it this way without letting \nveterans make decisions on their own, it can overwhelm the VA. That is \nwhat has been mentioned by OMB.\n  Veterans are already facing tough challenges. So is the VA health \nsystem that they can go to. But we don't need to add any more to their \nplates without at least hearing how it is going to affect the services \nthat are already being provided to our veterans.\n  That is why, just so you know, I am offering a motion to recommit \nthis morning. My motion to recommit, if adopted, would send this bill \nback to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to consider an amendment to \nH.R. 4673 that would delay implementation until 30 days after the VA \nhas certified that it can implement, without disruption, services to \nveterans or requiring additional funds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't see how those who support this bill, despite its \nproblems and the Biden administration's recognition that it may cause \nchallenges, can object to this amendment. The very least we can do for \nthe millions of veterans who are already enrolled in VA care and \ncounting on VA services is to ensure--before this bill goes into \neffect--that it won't cause undue harm to them. I have already drafted \nan amendment that would accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my motion to \nrecommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in response to my friend, the esteemed \nranking member, that his MTR, which would delay implementation in order \nto avoid harm to our veterans, dare I say that the harm is in the \ndelay.\n  I am reminded of a quote from the VFW's Pat Murray that we had at \nyesterday's roundtable on toxic exposure: Our pay-for for this bill and \nour pay-for, frankly, for all that we do for veterans was the ticket \nthat we sent servicemembers overseas to serve. I repeat: Our pay-for \nwas the ticket we sent servicemembers overseas to serve.\n  And a little further discussion on the pay-for issue: The \nCongressional Budget Office does not estimate that this bill will \nincrease mandatory spending and does not require an offset. These are \nthe rules we play by.\n  Again, we are not creating new eligibility here. The only cost of \nthis bill is veterans seeking care that they are already eligible for. \nWe are all better off when veterans are seeking the care that they \nneed, and we should not be hiding that care for which they are \neligible.\n  Automatic enrollment in VA healthcare for eligible veterans is a \nlong-needed suicide prevention tool. We cannot put a price tag on \nprotecting the health and safety of our veterans. Many of these \nveterans would go on to use VA healthcare even if they are not \nautomatically enrolled, and the minority does not give a compelling \nreason why we should hinder or make that process more difficult for our \nveterans.\n  Again, I repeat, we should not be hiding the care for which our \nveterans are already eligible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in passing H.R. \n4673, as amended, and I anticipate we will see a big bipartisan vote \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R. \n1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST), which \nprovides automatic enrollment in the VA for all transitioning service \nmembers, and veterans who don't want to obtain its services have the \neasy choice of opting out.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  January 20, 2022, on page H263, in the third column, the \nfollowing appeared: Mrs JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in \nstrong support of H.R. 1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth \nTransition Act\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: Ms. JACKSON LEE. \nMr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R. 1836, the \nEnsuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n  Specifically, this bill would:\n  Automatically enroll new veterans into VA Health Care;\n  Provide VA with information about transitioning service members;\n  Require the VA to reach out to veterans about the scope of, and \naccess to, benefits.\n  Assuring future cohorts of veterans--including those struggling with \nthe Taliban triumph in Afghanistan--don't go without health care during \ntheir transition from military to civilian life is the worthy goal of \nthis bill.\n  After attempting suicide while serving on active duty in Iraq, \nKristofer Goldsmith was given a general discharge by the Army and \nlittle else.\n  The overwhelmed 21-year-old returned to his hometown on Long Island, \nN.Y., totally unaware that he was eligible for care from the Veterans \nHealth Administration (VA).\n  ``I had just lost my income, my support network, my identity, and \nalmost my life. I was in a total mental health crisis,'' Goldsmith \nsaid.\n  During the critical months following his transition to civilian life, \nhe went without desperately needed services.\n  If his mother hadn't forced him to go to the VA, Goldsmith, who \ncredits the VA with helping him rebuild his life, doesn't know what \nwould have happened to him.\n  Of this, however, he is certain, ``If I had heard from my local VA \ninforming me of what benefits I had and that I'd been enrolled in the \nsystem, it would have changed my life drastically.''\n  This bill would help thousands of veterans who need services for the \nmultitude of conditions acquired or exacerbated by military service but \nare confused about how to access them.\n\n[[Page H264]]\n\n  These ailments include everything from respiratory problems caused by \nburn-pit toxic exposure to signature combat conditions such as \nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n  For all these problems, prompt attention means everything.\n  For example, according to research conducted by the VA, veterans who \nreceived care soon after the end of their service ``had lower levels of \nPTSD upon follow-up a year after they initiated care.\n  According to the study, for each year that a veteran waited to \ninitiate treatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of \ntheir PTSD either not improving or worsening.\n  In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine \nfound that post-9/11 veterans who had not sought VA mental health care \ndidn't know how to apply for benefits--or were unsure whether they were \neven eligible.\n  Some didn't know what services the VA offered or felt that they \ndidn't deserve care even if they could get it.\n  Some women veterans are similarly unsure whether VA services are even \navailable to their gender.\n  This legislation will not only be key to eliminating these barriers \nbut also to reducing the veteran suicide crisis.\n  A disproportionate number of veterans die by suicide during the \ninitial months and years following separation from military service.\n  Veterans ages 18 to 34 have the highest rate of suicide.\n  Automatic pre-enrollment could be lifesaving during a crisis when \nspeed is of the essence.\n  Smoother access to VA health care has never been more important than \nit is today.\n  The tumultuous end of the war in Afghanistan is intensifying mental \nhealth symptoms within the veteran population.\n  I am proud to support this legislation in order to better serve \nveterans and reduce veteran suicide.\n  This bill, in which we further the benefits and recognition that our \nservicemen and women deserve, also reminds us that we have an \noverriding duty to protect the health and dignity of those serving \ntoday.\n  For this reason, I would like to discuss the crisis that our National \nGuardsmen and Guardswomen have been thrust into at the Texas Governor's \ndirection on our Southern Border.\n  In March 2021, the Texas Governor launched the ill-fated and \nineffective Operation Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to stem \na so-called invasion of migrants at Texas' southern border.\n  As of November 2021, more than 10,000 Texas National Guardsmen have \nbeen deployed to the southern border in pursuit of this folly.\n  According to published media accounts, National Guard members who \nhave been activated for Operation Lone Star are experiencing habitual \npay delays and poor working conditions during the border mission, \nincluding being exposed to COVID-19, and many are missing the equipment \nnecessary for safety and mission success.\n  In addition, the National Guard has faced austere conditions and \nlimited resources, leading to unsanitary conditions such as the lack of \nportable restrooms.\n  Rather than addressing these conditions, just last week the Texas \nGovernor filed a frivolous lawsuit in federal court challenging the \nauthority of President Biden, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed \nForces to require that members of the National Guard be vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19.\n  There is no merit to this nuisance law suit as demonstrated by the \nsummary rejection of similar arguments raised by neighboring Oklahoma \nGovernor Stitt.\n  The Texas Governor's failure to comply with the policies intended to \nreduce the spread of COVID-19 among the Armed Forces will mean that \nthere will be less military personnel available national disasters that \nhave struck Texas in recent years, such as the winter freeze of last \nyear.\n  This will also mean that there are fewer personnel to respond to any \nattacks on the homeland.\n  Encouraged by the Texas Governor's obstinacy, about 40% of the \nmembers of the Texas Army National Guard are refusing to get \nvaccinated, which puts at risk their colleagues and the persons they \nare sworn to defend and protect.\n  National Guardsmen and Guardswomen deployed in this disastrous \nmission at the Texas Governor's insistence face the deadly spread of \nCOVID-19, unsanitary conditions, lack of pay, and a lack of a certain \nfuture.\n  These uniformed men and women deserve better, and some of them, \nseeing no alternative to their present reality, have decided to end it \nall.\n  Five National guard soldiers have shot and killed themselves in the \npast three months, and one more survived a suicide attempt.\n  One of these men, private first class Joshua R. Cortez, was preparing \nto accept a ``lifetime job'' with one of the nation's biggest health \ninsurance companies in late October last year, but the Texas National \nGuard had other ideas.\n  Operation Lone Star required involuntary activations to meet the \nTexas Governor's troop quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers \ntapped to go on state active duty orders--with no idea how long the \nmission would last.\n  In November, the 21-year-old mechanic requested a hardship release \nfrom the mission: ``I've been waiting for this job and I'm on my way to \ngetting hired . . . I missed my first opportunity in September when I \nhad to go on the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not miss this \nopportunity because it is my last opportunity for this lifetime job.''\n  Cortez's company commander recommended approval. But his battalion \ncommander and brigade commander disapproved.\n  Within 36 hours of his request being denied, Cortez drove to a \nparking lot in northwest San Antonio and shot himself in the head.\n  Three other soldiers tied to Operation lone Star have died by \nsuicide, including:\n  Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He \nwas a member of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion's headquarters \ncompany.\n  1st Sgt. John ``Kenny'' Crutcher died Nov. 12, as time ran out on his \ntemporary hardship waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 3rd \nBattalion, 144th Infantry.\n  1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in Crutcher's company, \ndied at home overnight Dec. 17 while on pass.\n  The string of suicides raises urgent questions about the mission's \nconditions and purpose, as well as the way it's organized and manned \nthrough indefinite involuntary call-ups.\n  This is an excellent and common-sense bill that will enhance the \nbenefits of our servicemen and women.\n  We must also act to ensure that our servicemen and women are \nprotected from COVID-19, both for their own safety and the safety of \nour nation.\n  Although we cannot bring back the lives lost due to the Texas \nGovernor's misguided actions, we can remember the names of those we \nhave lost and work to ensure that we treat all members of our military \nequally and with dignity and respect.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Bost) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of these en bloc \namendments. Seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and care \nthey earned through their service is paramount to the transition \nprocess.\n  The Delgado amendment No. 1 makes sure that VA can easily notify \nveterans regarding care and services through mass texting. As \ntechnology and communication methods improve, so should how VA uses \nthose capabilities to easily inform veterans of their benefits. Texting \neligible veterans to tell them they have been auto-enrolled in VA \nhealthcare is an effective, simple way to increase awareness of the \ncare available to them.\n  The Delgado amendment No. 2 requires GAO to submit a report to \ndetermine the best methods to notify veterans regarding their automatic \nenrollment in VA healthcare. This amendment will strengthen the \nunderlying bill and inform best practices for how VA can ensure \nveterans have the information they need regarding their access to care \nand services.\n  Getting information to veterans in an effective manner is crucial to \ntheir transition into civilian life, and the Delgado amendment No. 2 \nwill help improve how VA communicates an eligible veteran's enrollment \nin VA healthcare so they can easily access the care they need.\n  The Hayes amendment requires that VA notify veterans who opt out of \nautomatic enrollment that they may elect to enroll at a later date. We \nunderstand there will be some veterans who opt out for auto-enrollment \nfor a variety of reasons, but it is our duty that they know that the VA \nwill be waiting for them if their future needs change.\n  Ensuring VA adopts and scales best practices related to auto-\nenrollment while also learning from any issues that arise during its \nrollout is important to the long-term effectiveness of the aims of H.R. \n4673.\n  The Tlaib amendment requires the VA to submit a report a year after \nthe first veteran is auto-enrolled in VA healthcare to preserve lessons \nlearned from the rollout. This report will help improve auto-enrollment \nfor both the VA administrators implementing the program and veteran \nusers alike.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendments, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the four en bloc amendments are offered by Congressman \nDelgado, Congresswoman Hayes, and Congresswoman Tlaib. I thank them for \ntheir work. I remain opposed to the underlying bill, and I explained \nwhy in detail over the last debate.\n  One of the reasons I was opposed to it is because the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs did not do our job before bringing this bill to the \nfloor. We did not hold hearings on the bill or seek input from \nstakeholders. And importantly, we did not get assurance from the VA \nthat the bill could be implemented without negative impact to services.\n  In fact, shortly before this bill hit the Rules Committee, the Biden \nadministration did release the statement that we talked about earlier. \nThat statement, remember, says that there are challenges in \nimplementing this bill.\n  Now, I wish we could have done that work in the VA Committee before \nconsidering the bill on the floor. If there are challenges, we need to \nknow about them, and we need to be able to address them to make sure \nthat no veteran is harmed by this bill.\n  Nevertheless, here we are. These en bloc amendments will help get \nsome of the information we should have gotten before passing the bill. \nThey will help us stay informed on how the bill is working and the \nimpact it is having on veterans and on the VA healthcare system after \nthe fact.\n  For example, one of Congressman Delgado's amendments would require \nGAO to study the best methods for VA to notify newly separated \nservicemembers of their enrollment status. His second amendment would \nrequire VA to consider texting newly separated servicemembers to inform \nthem of their enrollment status and their ability to disenroll. If a \nveteran chooses to disenroll, Congresswoman Hayes' amendment would \nrequire VA to provide them with information on how to enroll at a later \ndate if they change their mind down the line.\n  Finally, Congresswoman Tlaib's amendment would require VA to report \nto Congress on the implementation of this bill not later than 1 year \nafter enactment. That would allow us to course-correct, as needed, if \nthe bill is causing problems at least 1 year out.\n  Now, I feel like a broken record, but this is information we should \nhave had already. Nevertheless, it is better late than never. That is \nwhy I will be in support of that amendment alongside the amendments for \nDelgado and Hayes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney), my good friend who serves on the House \nCommittee on Armed Services as chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower \nand Projection Forces and the Committee on Education and Labor.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano and Ranking Member Bost \nfor supporting the en bloc.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to speak on behalf of the Hayes \namendment offered by my friend and neighbor from Connecticut, \nCongresswoman Jahana Hayes, who unfortunately could not be here today \nbecause she is\n\n[[Page H266]]\n\nquarantining. Her amendment is a commonsense proposal to improve an \nalready outstanding bill that will connect more veterans to benefits \nthey have earned by volunteering to wear the uniform of this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, last year, at the outset of the VA's highly successful \nCOVID vaccination program, Congresswoman Hayes and I both toured the VA \nhospital in West Haven, Connecticut, which is the flagship of our VA \nhealthcare system. I had a chance to personally observe her authentic, \nwell-informed advocacy for veteran patients and their family members, \nasking questions about ways Congress can improve the system, \nparticularly about communicating the full extent of their benefits.\n  She described casework from the veterans seeking care, about the \nburdens they faced when navigating a complicated system where not only \nveterans, but family members struggle to stay current with changing \nrules and programs. It is particularly troublesome to hear cases of \nveterans who lose eligibility for help because of late claims caused by \npoor communication, oftentimes at the time of discharge from military \nservice.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why it is so important for the House to pass the \nEVEST Act which will provide automatic enrollment in the VA system for \nall transitioning servicemembers.\n  Mrs. Hayes' friendly amendment wisely requires the VA to go the extra \nmile and inform veterans who opt out of automatic enrollment through \nmultiple methods, including not only email but also paper mail, that \nthey can reenroll as they transition out of the military. Her measure \nis a commonsense insurance that veterans are informed of the EVEST so \nthat they know from day one all of the options and rights that they \nhave to get help.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Chair Takano and Ranking Member \nBost.\n  And I will close by simply noting that my district in eastern \nConnecticut is home to the largest military installation in New \nEngland, with 9,000 sailors and officers who work every day to protect \nour Nation. The transition from military to civilian life happens on a \nrolling, nonstop basis. Too often we work with veterans who experience \ngaps in benefits caused by a failure to enroll or late enrollment, \nwhich this excellent bill will fix.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Hayes \namendment in the en bloc and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), my good friend and author of this amendment. \nShe serves on the Financial Services Committee, the Natural Resources \nCommittee and the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and the committee \nstaff for working with me on this important amendment and for their \nleadership on this bill. I can't thank him enough and look forward to \nhim one day coming to my district for a visit to our VA hospital that \nwe love and cherish.\n  Mr. Speaker, the transition of being on Active Duty to being a \nveteran is not easy. The EVEST Act helps with that transition and makes \nlife easier for those who served our Nation.\n  This act is also a great opportunity to review the automatic \nenrollment programs and learn what works and what doesn't, because \nensuring effective implementation is critical to its success.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a social worker at heart, and we have to ensure \nthat our veterans' lives are changing for the better with this bill. My \namendment ensures the lessons learned during implementation of the \nprogram are preserved for other agencies, as well as to learn, again, \nwhat to do and what not to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the committee for working with me on this \nand look forward to my colleagues' support of this amendment. I also \nlook forward to working with the committee on a number of other issues \nimpacting our veterans, especially veteran suicide and access to mental \nhealth services.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Green), my good friend and member of the Financial Services \nCommittee where he is chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations.\n  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, by way of further introduction, I am \nthe same Al Green who lives across the street from the DeBakey VA \nhospital; the same Al Green who fought in this Congress to secure a \nCongressional Gold Medal for Dr. Michael E. DeBakey; the same Al Green \nwho has 800 flags outside of his office presently to be distributed \nover at the DeBakey VA hospital; the same Al Green that goes there \nannually and speaks to veterans, who talks to them about their needs on \nan annual basis; the same Al Green who has had veterans who tell me the \ndifficulties associated with enrollment; the same Al Green who has \nveterans who say they are so pleased that somebody would come by to be \nof service to them.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Al Green announces here and now that I will support \nthe underlying bill. I support it because it is necessary. I support it \nbecause I believe the veterans that I have spoken to will support it. \nThey need it, and they will enjoy knowing that we came to this floor to \nbring this to fruition.\n  Mr. Speaker, finally, if the VA hospital is not properly funded and \nthis creates some funding issues, I am prepared to vote to fund the VA \nhospital sufficiently so that our veterans can be taken care of. Anyone \nwho is willing to go to a distant place, who may not return the same \nway they left, who may have issues for the rest of their lives, and \nthey do it because they want to protect this country, I am going to do \nall that I can to protect them. This is the least a grateful Nation can \ndo.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to \nclose. I ask all my colleagues to support me in supporting these four \namendments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \nprevious question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  The question is on the amendments en bloc.\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 offered by Ms. Escobar\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. \n3 printed in part B of House Report 117-225.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 12, insert after ``a veteran'' the following: \n     ``who is discharged or separated from the Armed Forces on or \n     after the date that is 90 days before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his continued, strong, \nunwavering leadership on behalf of our veterans.\n  I am proud to represent a district that is home to a strong and \ngrowing veteran community, and proud to represent Fort Bliss in \nCongress, where thousands of our servicemembers transition to civilian \nlife.\n  One of my top priorities in Congress has been to protect our veterans \nand their families in the same way they have served and defended our \ncountry. Today, I am honored to stand in support of this critical \nlegislation for our Nation's veterans and to present my amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4673, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act, \nprovides automatic enrollment in the VA for all transitioning \nservicemembers. This bill is vital in that it expedites\n\n[[Page H267]]\n\nthe use of healthcare benefits that veterans have already earned. My \namendment seeks to ensure that servicemembers who were discharged up to \n90 days before the enactment of this legislation can also reap its \nbenefits.\n  Servicemembers transitioning to civilian life already face a \nmultitude of hurdles, from adjusting to everyday life, dealing with \nunemployment issues, housing and security, and poor mental and physical \nhealth, among other things.\n  Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve that we eliminate these and any \nother barriers. Thousands of veterans leave the service without knowing \nabout the VA, whether they are eligible, and what benefits they are \nentitled to receive.\n  Veterans who returned to civilian life during the pandemic faced even \nmore challenges to access and overall engagement with the VA due to \nclosures and the VA's limited operational capacity at the height of the \npandemic. We cannot leave these veterans behind.\n  Already, more than half of eligible veterans don't use VA health \nbenefits, many of which are due to confusion on eligibility and \nbenefits and lack of access to information. The pandemic only \nexacerbated this. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan this past year \nsimilarly impacted millions of veterans who now need that care more \nthan ever.\n  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is not adding any new entitlements. It is \nsimply extending them to those who are equally in need. With my \namendment to this bill, we can ensure that newly transitioned veterans \ndo not miss the opportunity to access VA benefits they deserve and are \nentitled to.\n  As our chairman has said, when it comes to supporting our veterans, \nthe true heroes of our country, there is always more work to be done. \nThis bill is truly transformative and assures future cohorts of \nveterans receive the expeditious access to the healthcare they need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman is \nrecognized.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Escobar's amendment would expand automatic \nenrollment to servicemembers who left the military 90 days before this \nbill is enacted. There are already many existing mechanisms for \nseparating servicemembers to connect with the VA if that is something \nthey need and want.\n  As I explained during the general debate, I have a number of serious \nconcerns with the underlying bill. The Biden administration agrees that \nthere are challenges. I think that is an understatement. Regardless, we \nshould not be further complicating an already difficult implementation \nby expanding it even more.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Escobar amendment \nto H.R. 4673.\n  Mr. Speaker, seamlessly connecting veterans with the benefits and \ncare they have earned through their service is paramount to the \ntransition process. The Escobar amendment extends the automatic \nenrollment in VA healthcare to eligible veterans discharged within 90 \ndays before enactment of the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of the 175,000 veterans who served in Operation \nEnduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn are \nunaware of their eligibility for 5 years of VA healthcare upon \nseparation. Automatically enrolling recently separated eligible \nveterans into VA healthcare will support our aim to prevent veteran \nsuicides and improve their access to care during their transition to \ncivilian life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Escobar amendment.\n  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 860, the \nprevious question is ordered on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar).\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Escobar).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appear to have it.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, as a Clinton County native, I rise today in \nhonor of the 2021 Division IV Ohio high school football State champion, \nthe Clinton-Massie Falcons.\n  On December 3, 2021, the Clinton-Massie Falcons defeated the \nYoungstown Ursuline Irish in a thrilling comeback victory that one \nwould expect to see in a movie.\n  Trailing 28-7 late in the third quarter, the Falcons kept their poise \nand refused to be denied. They shut down the Irish offense while \nscoring on three straight possessions. The Falcon's final touchdown \ncame on a fourth and goal from the 1-yard line with under 1 minute to \nplay.\n  With the score 28-27, the team didn't think twice when given the \nchoice. They went for 2 points and the win to bring home the school's \nthird State championship in just under 10 years.\n  To Coach Dan McSurley and every player on the Falcon roster, \ncongratulations. As a former captain of the East Clinton Astro football \nteam, I understand the obstacles that you have had to overcome to earn \nthis title. You have made our county proud and proven that hard work \nand determination truly pay off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden's Infrastructure \nInvestment and Jobs Act that I and many of us voted for, we are now \nputting those resources on the ground across America.\n  The first billions of dollars to go to California and every State in \nthe Union are now being put in place to fix bridges. Next, we are going \nto fix our roads and build our infrastructure to electrify our system \nthroughout the country.\n  These are the kinds of things that our voters sent us to Washington \nto do, to bring those resources back to every single community, every \nsingle one of our communities, and that is what we are doing here in \nCongress with a President who actually believes in the fundamentals of \ninfrastructure and making sure that we put our American workers back to \nwork to build our Nation as it should be and what we are so proud of.\n  We are the number one infrastructure place in the world, and we will \ncontinue to be so with these investments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-year \nanniversary of President Biden's inauguration and 1 year under one-\nparty rule.\n  And I ask: Is America better off? The answer is no.\n  Since President Biden took office, we have seen crisis after crisis.\n  We are facing an economic crisis. President Biden and the Democrats \nhad the tools to bring our economy back to the prepandemic records of \n2019. But instead, we have massive supply shortages, labor shortages, \nand an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high.\n  Our country faces an energy crisis. We went from being energy \nindependent to begging OPEC+ to produce more oil to offset the rising \ncosts. This is because of anti-American energy policies enacted over \nthe past year.\n  Mr. Speaker, the list goes on: an education crisis as our youth \ncontinue to face uncertainty in the classroom; a national security \ncrisis as our presence on the world stage has been weakened and our \nsouthern border remains vulnerable; and a crime crisis following \ndangerous defund the police rhetoric.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not the leadership America needs right now.

Mr. Speaker, today marks one year of Democrats in \nCongress working alongside the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of \nAmerican families.\n  I am proud of what we have accomplished so far, including the once-\nin-a-generation investment in our roads and bridges made by the \nbipartisan infrastructure law. With nearly 2,500 bridges in poor \ncondition, Illinois ranks third among States with crumbling bridge \ninfrastructure. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Illinois \nwill receive $1.4 billion to repair and rebuild these bridges, like the \nBlackberry Creek and Mendota railroad bridges in my district.\n  These upgrades will save Illinoisans money on costly car repairs and \ntime on their daily commutes. This long-overdue investment will also \nconnect our communities and support our supply chain, while creating \ngood-paying jobs and spurring economic development.\n  With the partnership of the Biden-Harris administration, we have \nspent the last 365 days delivering for the American people. Our work is \nfar from finished.\n\n[[Page H271]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of great respect and \nmourn the loss of Dr. Marcy Zwelling from California.\n  Dr. Zwelling, since 2012, has headed up the National Physicians \nCouncil for Healthcare Policy, which is a group of some 570 independent \nphysicians across the country. Dr. Zwelling not only challenged me but \nchallenged all 570 members of the Physicians Council to please advocate \non behalf of not only patients but also physicians. She dedicated her \nservice and life not only to patients, attempting to give them the very \nbest of medical help, but also for physicians. Physicians who many \ntimes are faced with innumerable challenges, not just to provide \nservice but also in their own lives.\n  So it is today I offer to the House of Representatives the great life \nof Dr. Marcy Zwelling who passed away this last weekend. May she rest \nin peace. May God bless her life and that which she gave each of us.\n  Whether she was helping organize one of the over nine conferences of \nthe National Physicians Council for Healthcare Policy nationwide, \ndeveloping new screening tools for patients with cancer, or supporting \nher fellow physicians, Dr. Zwelling served as an inspiration and \nservant leader for myself and so many others in the medical community. \nI will miss her leadership and inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the name of Dr. Martin \nLuther King and John Robert Lewis, our late colleague.\n  I rise today to say that we are not finished. The work of this Nation \nis not finished, even in the aftermath of a sinister vote on the floor \nof the United States Senate that could not see clearly to determine \nthat the Constitution and the right to vote rose above the silly and \ninsignificant rule of the Senate called the filibuster.\n  In the midst of that debate, we heard eloquent and beautiful \nstatements about the many times the filibuster had been eliminated or \nrelieved. We heard a brilliant analysis of the Constitution and the \nFounding Fathers' desire for the filibuster not to be in the \nConstitution, yet due process and the 15th Amendment are.\n  Mr. Speaker, we saw justice crushed and democracy gored. In Texas, of \ncourse, more criminal laws are now related to voting. Poll watchers can \nattack voters in terms of what they are doing. We are now in a \nconstitutional hearing in Judiciary. It is my commitment to go forward \non the John Robert Lewis and all the bills attached to it because the \nNation is crying out for justice. The country is crying out for \ndemocracy. We will not let it down. The Senate must continue its \ndebate, and we must get these billed passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind the American people \nthat today marks President Biden's one year in office and 365 days of \nhis disastrous failure at our southern border.\n  Forty percent of Americans graded Joe Biden's immigration policy with \na big fat F for his failures. His open border policy has proven month \nafter month to be not only unsuccessful but downright dangerous for the \nAmerican people.\n  More deadly fentanyl products have been smuggled into our \nneighborhoods this year than ever before. Nearly 11,000 pounds were \napprehended in the last year alone.\n  Biden's wide open southern border is poisoning our communities and \ncausing unthinkable harm. His bad policy is taking lives. It is no \nsurprise that our Nation's number of overdoses reached an all-time high \nin 2021. My heart breaks for the parents who have lost their children \nwhile our President plays politics.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have said it before, and I will say it again. Border \nsecurity is national security. It is time to stop deliberately \ndestroying the safety of innocent Americans for the sake of politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago, I spoke here about the \ndelays in our postal system, and a year later the calls to our office \nhave not stopped. In fact, they have gotten more frequent and more \nfrantic.\n  Since the start of this year, 50 percent of all the phone calls our \noffice has received are about disruptions in the Postal Service. These \nare from seniors whose essential medications and Social Security checks \nwere over 2 weeks delayed; folks with missing credit card statements, \nMedicare cards, past due still undelivered bills accruing interest that \nthey can't pay because their paycheck hasn't come in; small business \nowners reliant on the mail who are completely unable to operate.\n  Now, to be sure, the pandemic contributes to some of this. It has \nincreased demand on the mail system, even as postal workers are staying \nhome, quarantining, looking after loved ones. While leaders in the \nprivate sector have adapted to this moment, Postmaster DeJoy has \nresponded to this by eliminating overtime, closing mail processing \nfacilities, and removing mail sorting machines. He has made things \nworse.\n  Now, in the private sector we would fix that. A corporate board \nwouldn't tolerate it. They would hold this man to account. That hasn't \nhappened because we still don't have a fully staffed Postal Board of \nGovernors thanks to the Senate's failure to confirm President Biden's \nnominations. This is no way to run a business. It is no way to treat \nthe American people.\n  The Postal Service needs leaders as committed to public service as \nour letter carriers and mail handlers. Frankly, so does the U.S. \nSenate. It is time for them to act, to confirm these nominees and \nensure the post office has a fully staffed and fully functioning board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Lauren \nGollofon from Bozeman, Montana. Lauren is a 17-year-old senior at \nLiberty Online Academy and a former student at Bozeman High School. \nWhen Lauren became aware that the Pledge of Allegiance was not being \nsaid daily in public schools in Bozeman, she sprang into action. Lauren \nnotified school administrators that their failure to hold the Pledge of \nAllegiance every day violated Montana House Bill 543, and asked that \nthey hold the Pledge of Allegiance daily in accordance with the State \nlaw.\n  Within a week of her advocacy, local schools began to recite the \nPledge of Allegiance daily. When asked why this was so important, \nLauren said patriotism is on the decline in the United States. When \nstudents say the Pledge of Allegiance, they are acknowledging the \nfreedom and the values and also everyone who has died and fought for \nour country.\n  This display of patriotism demonstrates why a report just this year \nfound that Montana is one of the most patriotic States in the Nation, a \nranking which we are extremely proud of.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Montanans, I want to sincerely thank \nLauren Gollofon for her leadership, community activism, and her \ndedication to the core principles that make this country great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bob Briggs of\n\n[[Page H272]]\n\nWestminster, Colorado, who passed away on December 2, 2021.\n  Bob was born December 24, 1937, in Greeley, Colorado, as one of eight \nchildren and the oldest son. His family moved to Westminster in 1943 \nwhere Bob graduated from Westminster High School.\n  He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Colorado \nState University, both in horticulture. According to a January 2020 \nprofile in Orchard Living, he majored in horticulture because he did \nnot want to wear a tie for a living.\n  Bob married his wife, Shirley, on September 8, 1957. He had a long \ncareer in local and State politics, serving as Adams County \nCommissioner for 4 years, beginning in 1979--where he actually helped \nme on one of my very first cases that I had as a lawyer--as the local \nboard member for the Regional Transportation District for 4 years in \n1999, and a State representative for District 29 from January 2003 to \n2005. He served terms on the Westminster City Council, including a \nstint as mayor pro tem. He was a longtime proponent of local rail and \nhelped found the advocacy group Rocky Mountain Rail.\n  Mr. Speaker, Bob was a devoted husband and a loving father and \ngrandfather. He and Shirley raised two children and enjoyed spending \ntime with their grandchildren.

Mr. Speaker, under recent comments President Biden made \nabout his first year, he talked about under-promising and over-\ndelivering.\n  Given what the year looks like, please, Mr. President, under-deliver.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country has seen unprecedented crisis and record \ninflation, supply chain disruptions, price surges, gas and energy costs \ngoing through the roof, food supply shortages, empty shelves \neverywhere, higher prices.\n  Unfortunately, the failures of Biden's first year in office isn't \nlimited to just the United States alone. No, he hastily evacuated our \ntroops from Afghanistan, leaving behind as many as 14,000 U.S. citizens \nand legal residents and friends, as well as billions of dollars of \ncountless weapons of ours that have fallen into the hands of the \nTaliban. So over 20 years of a record of Taliban and they get all these \nweapons to use against us or our friends in the neighborhood.\n  If this is not bad enough, the administration is now proposing to \nsend over $300 million in foreign aid, basically, to the Taliban regime \nto do all the great things they have been doing. People in Afghanistan \ndo need help, but we know the funds or food we send over there will go \nstraight into the wrong hands.\n  We need to have a better chain of supply to help them than what the \nBiden administration is proposing. The nonprofit rescue group known as \nSave Our Allies has been working tirelessly to rescue those left behind \nby President Biden's disaster over there. They warn that the funds and \nsupplies will not go into the hands of the average Afghan but, instead, \nstraight into the hands of the Taliban.

Mr. Speaker, the history of New Mexico and our rural \ncommunities predate the founding of our great Nation. Our communities \ncarry rich traditions and ways of life, from our tribal communities, to \nour land grants, to our farmers and ranchers and small towns that dot \nthe plains, mountains, and river valleys of our beautiful State.\n  They are diverse, resilient, vibrant, and full of grit and \ndetermination. For far too long, our rural communities have been left \nbehind in critical infrastructure, which is why I am deeply proud that \nour bipartisan infrastructure bill is already delivering for New \nMexico, investing millions in rural roads, bridges, and airports, \nbroadband, our electric grid, and life-giving water, creating thousands \nof jobs, and supporting rural economic development across our State, \nbecause our rural communities are the backbone of New Mexico.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we are working together to invest in \ninfrastructure, to invest in jobs, and the well-being of our future and \nour communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, January is School Board Director \nRecognition Month, and I want to take a moment, as a former school \nboard member and school board president, to recognize the contributions \nof these unpaid but essential community servants.\n  In the best of times, being a school board member is challenging, \nrequiring community members to step up and address issues ranging from \nchild development to HR, and from transportation and construction to \nnutrition and natural disasters. There is never enough money to do \neverything we would like to for our children, and the number of \nregulations, mandates, and laws that must be met seems to be never-\nending. It often seems like every choice is between two bad \nalternatives.\n  As school directors are facing these outsized challenges compounded \nby a pandemic and political polarization, and the mental health \nchallenges both have brought, I want to acknowledge their Herculean \nefforts to keep our children, our teachers, and our staff safe and give \nthem every opportunity to succeed.\n  I want them to know how much their efforts on behalf of our children, \nour schools, and our communities are appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the men and women who \nhave been on the front lines of this pandemic from the very beginning: \nour healthcare workers. On MLK Day, I had a chance to deliver care \npackages to hospitals and clinics in my district in Joliet, Aurora, and \nNaperville as a small token of appreciation for the tireless work of \nour healthcare workers.\n  As our Nation confronts this, hopefully final, winter surge of COVID, \nwe should all keep in mind the people who are still going to work every \nday to care for people who are sick. Their dedication to their jobs is \ntruly inspiring, and they are literally saving lives every day. After \nalmost 2 years of battling COVID, our healthcare workers are mentally \nand physically exhausted, but yet they still show up every day to \nprovide care for others.\n  We can all learn so much from them.\n  I am honored to represent so many of them in my district in places \nlike Edward Hospital in Naperville, Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox, \nRush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, and Aunt Martha's Health Center \nin Joliet; just to name a few.\n  So I want every healthcare worker in America--doctors, nurses, and \nsupport staff--to know that they are not alone. I thank them for being \nthere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, today marks 1 year of total \nDemocrat control of the Federal Government--1 year of this Biden \nadministration. In addition to all the other disastrous policies and \nthe crises created by this President, it marks another year with 1 \nmillion babies being slaughtered in the womb in our country.\n  Tomorrow we will, once again, march for life here in Washington, DC, \nand I will be privileged to join that march. May it be the last time \nthat we do that before the Supreme Court rightly overturns the brutal, \nvicious, inhumane, dishonest, and inaccurate interpretation of the \nhighest law of the land--the Constitution--giving the right to \nterminate a pregnancy in the womb.\n  Sixty-five million babies have been lost since that happened nearly \n50 years ago. These are inventors, these are scientists, these are \nministers, and these are healthcare providers who are not serving and \nhelping our country here today.\n  Equality begins in the womb, and freedom begins in the womb, and the \nscience tells us that life begins in the womb. May the Supreme Court \noverturn Roe, and may we begin to protect all innocent, precious life \nin the womb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, in business, a 1-year review is customary. \nSo let's review the Biden administration's first year by the numbers. \nAs we tend to say in business, the numbers don't lie.\n  Regarding the economy, there are 6 million Americans unemployed while \n10 million jobs remain unfilled. The vast majority of small businesses \nare hiring, yet 95 percent report few applications. Inflation, Mr. \nSpeaker, is at a 40-year high of 7 percent. Gas is up 50 percent, and \nit costs about $100 to fill up the gas tank on a pickup truck.\n  Regarding national security, it is really no better. Two million \nillegals have crossed our border. Twice as much fentanyl is coming in; \nwe have over 100,000--sadly--fatalities throughout the United States. \nAnd we have 125,000 troops preparing to invade Ukraine.\n  We have 2-mile long lines for COVID testing in my district.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not going to hold our breath for corrective \naction to be taken by the Biden administration; they have stated how \nthey plan to double down.

WADE\n\n  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, as I stand at this podium, I will speak \nfor about 60 seconds, and within those 60 seconds, an unborn baby will \nlose its life. In fact, in America, an unborn baby will have its life \nripped away every 50 seconds through the gruesome procedure of \nabortion. This is about 630,000 unborn lives lost per year--a number \nthat equals about 80 percent of my congressional district.\n  This is tragic. God has a plan for these children. They are our \nbrothers, sisters, friends, and loved ones. They are future leaders, \nnurses, doctors, farmers, and small business owners. But, most \nimportantly, they are human beings with a purpose from our Creator. \nThere is nothing more hideous than taking the life of the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Forty-nine years ago, the decision made by the Supreme Court in Roe \nv. Wade has resulted in the death of over 62\\1/2\\ million unborn \nbabies. Despite the three-quarters of Americans who want significant \nrestrictions on abortions, my colleagues across the aisle are still \nprioritizing their abortion-on-demand agenda.\n  This is senseless. Together, as a nation, we must make this the last \nyear we speak on this horrible anniversary. We cannot wait another 50 \nseconds, another 50 months, or another 50 years. Everyone is entitled \nto the right to life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nRoy) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues who have been \ndown here on the floor of the House of Representatives for the most \npart of the last hour talking about the importance of defending life, \nthose infamous--or famous or important words, I should say, in the \nDeclaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Nothing can be more important than this body focusing on defending \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and my colleagues' focus \non life, as we sit here now 49 years removed from a Supreme Court \ndecision taking out of the hands of the people and putting it into the \nhands of unelected judges' decisions, about the beginning of life, when \nlife begins, the important reality of a people defending life.\n  What is controversial about defending life?\n  It is a question for this body.\n\n[[Page H284]]\n\n  What is controversial about defending life when we talk about life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness and when we talk about living on \nthis Earth while God gives us the precious time we have here?\n  What are we going to do with that time?\n  Are we going to live free?\n  Are we going to be able to pursue happiness?\n  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: one might wonder here \nnow 1 year into the current administration, the Biden administration, \nwhether the average American would say that he or she is free to pursue \nhappiness.\n  Are we free?\n  Are we free to pursue happiness when, in fact, just a few miles \naway--and, frankly, a few thousand feet--from this Chamber where we are \nright now, restaurants are being chastised and pursued by the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia representing this area that \nforms our Nation's Capitol because those restaurants may not believe \nthat it is in their interest or the interest of the people whom they \nserve to be checking papers and to be checking so-called vaccine \npassports or vaccine passes?\n  One restaurant in particular over on H Street--which was one of the \nearly restaurants on H Street as it was revitalizing--has been fined, \nberated, and harassed by the Government of the District of Columbia for \nwanting its doors to be open and not wanting to harass its patrons. \nThey want them to use their own free will to make a decision about what \nis in their interest. They don't want to live in a republic where you \nare forced to show papers to walk about and to engage in society, to \nfreely move about and engage in commerce.\n  The very heart of the kinds of ideas that the Founders meant and what \nJefferson meant when he penned pursuit of happiness is that we not \nallow a government through tyrannical policies to interfere with our \npursuit of happiness: our ability to go have a business, our ability to \ngo out and take care of our family, our ability to move about and to \nengage in commerce, our ability to create wealth and opportunity for \nour children and our grandchildren, to be able to get healthcare, and \nto be able to be secure in our possessions, secure in our belongings, \nand secure in our own homes.\n  I would ask this question: Is the United States more secure than it \nwas 1 year ago?\n  Is the United States stronger economically than it was 1 year ago?\n  Is the United States stronger on the world stage?\n  Are we safer from our enemies than we were 1 year ago?\n  Is our border secure?\n  Are we able to afford energy and have reliable energy to heat our \nhomes, fuel our cars, provide jobs, and keep us warm in the winter and \ncool in the summer?\n  Are we able to do that better more than 1 year ago?\n  The answer very clearly to all of those questions is a resounding \n``no.''\n  Do you think it is an accident that I just spent 2 hours in a hearing \nin the Judiciary Committee bemoaning the United States Senate for \nholding the line on the filibuster which Democrats and this President \nwanted to throw over the wall in the name of voting rights because \nnobody can oppose something called voting rights?\n  They put up those words, they call it the Voting Rights Act, and they \nname it after people we serve with in the Chamber to provide maximum \nguilt if you dare stand up and say, Mr. Speaker, that the people in the \nStates ought to be able to decide how to ensure that the elections of \nthe people who represent them are secure; that you dare to have a voter \nID favored by 80 percent of the American people.\n  But yet let's go back to what I just said: I have to have an ID just \nto walk in and buy a hamburger in the Nation's Capitol, but I cannot \nhave an ID to vote. No. No. No. That is Jim Crow 2.0 I am told by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  I actually had colleagues on the committee today walking through the \nhorrors of the poll tax--the jelly bean counting and all of the \nobstructions put into place for voting in the 1950s and 1960s that the \nVoting Rights Act nobly pursued to correct--and then tried to compare \nthat to voter identification.\n  They tried to compare that to wanting to make sure that mail-in \nballots aren't abused by anybody in any party, even though, by the way, \nthose bastions of crazy conservatism, Jimmy Carter and James Baker, \ncame out in a report over a decade ago that The New York Times quoted \nsaying precisely that mail-in ballots are the area where you have the \nmost fraud.\n  Now, all of us want to have integrity and belief in our elections. \nBut our Democratic colleagues want to use that issue to divide us, as \nPresident Biden literally admitted yesterday. In his 1-hour marathon \nwandering, meandering press conference, he literally said that he could \nnot say whether the elections will be legitimate this fall unless--\nunless--we embrace the legislation that he says must get passed and \nthat we must set aside the traditions of the Senate to jam it through. \nAnd all of it, very clearly, is to set the stage for a lack of faith \nand belief in the elections that are coming this November.\n  Again I ask: Is America stronger or weaker?\n  Is it richer or poorer? More secure or less safe?\n  We know the answer, and that is why my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle wish not to talk about those issues. We don't want to have \na debate about crime on the floor.\n  Do any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to come \ndown to the floor right now and have a debate about crime in the United \nStates?\n  Do they?\n  Do you think a 50 percent increase in crime in Austin, a 50 percent \nincrease in crime in San Antonio, a 19-year-old woman shot in a Burger \nKing in New York City, a 24-year-old student murdered walking the \nstreets of Los Angeles, train robberies in 21st century America with \nlitter all over the tracks in Los Angeles, is an accident?\n  Or could it be that radical leftists who are funded to take over the \ndistrict attorneys' offices in cities across America and radical city \ncouncils like the Austin City Council and leftists in this Chamber \nbelieve that letting criminals out on the streets and believe in not \nprosecuting people is going to make our country safer?\n  It is empirically and obviously untrue.\n  The American people see it. And I promise you, Mr. Speaker, take this \nbet: We will not have a debate on the floor of this body about crime \nwhile I am here this year. It will not happen. My Democratic colleagues \nwould not dare have a debate about crime because they would get \nabsolutely decimated.\n  They sure as heck do not want to have a debate about the border.\n  Do you want to talk about 2 million apprehensions?\n  Do you want to talk about 1 million people released?\n  Do you want to talk about dead Texans?\n  Do you want to talk about fentanyl pouring into our communities, \n100,000 dead Americans, opioid poisonings of our youth, and kids taking \nXanax and dying because cartels are flooding into our country while \nChina drives them right up through Mexico?\n  Not a person in this Chamber on the other side of the aisle wants to \ncome to the floor and have an adult debate about why our country is \nmuch less secure and much more endangered at the hands of the cartels \nand of people making money trafficking in human beings and undermining \nour security and safety in the United States of America.\n  I promise you, Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden and the Nancy Pelosi Democrats \nhave no interest in having a debate about the border because it is an \nembarrassment and it is a travesty.\n  Ranches are getting overrun, people are dying, bullets are being \nfired across at our own Border Patrol, the National Guard is having to \nfire at cars coming across the border, livestock is getting out, bodies \nare stacking up in body trailers in Brooks County, Texas, and cartels \nare making hundreds of millions of dollars on a daily basis driving \nfentanyl into our kids' communities and schools.\n  No, no, no. We do not want to have a debate about the state of our \nborder.\n  Do we want to have a debate about the state of healthcare mandates?\n  No. No. This body has no debate but embraces rules. We must wear \nmasks, they say. For a year and a half we have\n\n[[Page H285]]\n\nbeen excoriated--even fined--if you don't wear a mask the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives--masks which are very clearly proven--fabric \nmasks--to have no real discernible benefit over the last year and a \nhalf of the mandates that say you must wear a face covering.\n  They said: Well, are we going to mandate N95s?\n  Are we going to have to wear N95s on the floor?\n  Do they want to talk about the negative effects in the study that \nwearing N95s for a prolonged period of time, what that does for \npeople's health and well-being, breathing carbon dioxide, minimizing \nyour cognitive ability if you wear N95s for a long time?\n  Some people might joke: Would it make any difference on the floor of \nthe House if you minimized the cognitive ability of the Members of the \nHouse? You could argue that it may not make any difference whatsoever. \nI am looking in the mirror myself.\n  We do not want to have a debate on the floor of the House on \nanything, by the way, much less the reality of what has been happening \nwith respect to this virus and our response to it; and what Anthony \nFauci engaged in with respect to the reality of the truth of funding \ngain-of-function research knowing full well the dangers, working to \ncover that up and hide from the American people how this virus came \nabout; not wanting to pursue the truth on that, not wanting to pursue \nthe truth or conduct studies on natural immunity.\n  We have study after study after study coming out right now. I could \npull out on my phone and pull up study after study now finally \ndemonstrating and showing how natural immunity is more powerful than \nvaccinations, and people don't want to be able to have that honest \nconversation.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  An adult leadership would have done like the Nation of Japan saying: \nWe believe that vaccines are effective for a large group of people. We \nbelieve that there are some risks. You are adults. We won't mandate. \nYou decide.\n  We can't do that in the supposed land of the free? We sit up here and \nwe stare at that American flag and we talk about the Senate being the \ngreatest deliberative body. They don't really debate. This being the \npeople's House, the people's Chamber, when was the last time the \nSpeaker heard a robust debate on the floor of the House with multiple \nMembers?\n  When was the last time we offered an amendment on the floor of the \nHouse in open debate that wasn't predetermined by all of the Rules \nCommittee overlords who govern our lives? Democrat and Republican, I do \nwant to say.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 years since we have had an amendment \noffered on the floor of the House in open debate. Do you want to know \nwhy we can't do anything in this Chamber? Because we don't ever debate. \nWe don't ever actually have a discussion, throw things out there and \nthen vote. Maybe, just maybe, we come to some bipartisan agreement.\n  I am happy to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nDean Phillips and I worked on the PPP Flexibility Act. Abigail \nSpanberger and I have introduced legislation called the TRUST Act to \ndeal with stock trading believing that might help improve people's \nfaith and confidence in this body. I have introduced numerous bills and \npassed numerous bills with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. That is not what this is about.\n  It is about a broken body refusing to actually debate, refusing to \nactually engage, refusing to offer amendments. Both sides do it. That \nneeds to end.\n  The last point that I will make on that point, if you want this body \nto function again, you have to stop spending money we don't have. If \nyou keep writing blank checks, how on Earth is there a check against \nthe wisdom of the policy? You just keep writing a check to keep doing \nthe same thing or to do something different. You can't run a business \nthat way. You can't run a home that way. You can't run a church that \nway. You can't run a legitimate school that way. But no, no, we just \nkeep writing checks to fund the expansion of government, to fund the \ncreation of programs no matter who is in power.\n  Over the last year, we have seen what that causes when it is then \nleft in the hands of an administration that literally does not care \nabout the rule of law.\n  To be very clear, this administration is ignoring the rule of law, \nignoring their oath, ignoring their duty to enforce the laws of the \nUnited States, ignoring their duty to secure the border, ignoring their \nduty to stand up in defense of the men and women in blue, to follow the \nlaws around the United States, ignoring their oath to stand up and \ndefend the United States against our foreign enemies; hold the line \nagainst Russia; push back on Russia; sanction them; hold the line on \nNord Stream 2; stand alongside Ukraine; push back on China; stop \nappeasing them.\n  Don't leave $85 billion sitting there in the hands of terrorists when \nwe walk away and abandon our duty and leave those men and women in the \nfield, and then have 13 dead marines to show for it.\n  That is the legacy of the first year of this administration. But will \nPresident Biden, when he strolls to that podium on March 1 for his so-\ncalled State of the Union, and we are all spread out, and all wearing \nmasks, and doing whatever the heck we are going to do--not actually \ndoing the people's business--will he address any of those issues?\n  Will he talk about border security? Will he talk about how we are \nweaker around the world? Will he talk about the crime on the streets of \nLos Angeles, New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Chicago?\n  Will he talk about the businesses getting crippled by mask mandates \nand health mandates?\n  Will he talk about the children who are now having mental health \nissues, the people who are sick; the diseases that weren't dealt with, \nall to push a vaccine mandate that goes contrary to the pursuit of \nhappiness and our right as Americans to live free?\n  Will he talk about any of those things? Will he talk about the fact \nthat the United States of America is sitting on one of the world's \nlargest reservoirs of energy and, yet, we are wondering even in Texas \nwhether you can have the lights on because we built no nuclear power \nplants.\n  We slowed down our production of clean burning natural gas, all \nchasing unicorn energy policies of wind and solar as if they can \npossibly, possibly power the world at the level that is needed for the \nproper amount of human flourishing while 3 billion people around this \nplanet do not have access to abundant energy and power.\n  Will the President of the United States come down here and talk about \nthat or will he get up there and just talk about: Well, we are going to \nbe net zero in our carbon production by 2035, or 2050, or make up some \ntotally arbitrary number without regard at all to what that does to the \nprice of energy and the availability and abundance of energy.\n  All of this has real-life consequences for Americans. People die. \nHouses get cold. People can't get access to energy. They can't afford \nenergy. They lose jobs. You have stagnation and then you have the \nbrilliance of this administration and the brilliance of those in the \nmedia starting to talk about energy and food price control because, of \ncourse, that is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nresort to.\n  They will sit there and bemoan markets when they don't let the \nmarkets work. Healthcare markets never work. We haven't had a \nhealthcare market in decades. It is an absolute lie; and I am looking \nat you Big Healthcare. I am looking at you Big Pharma. I am looking at \nyou hospitals. I am looking at you Big Insurance. You made out like \nbandits after ObamaCare. You minted money. And probably three-quarters \nof the people in this Chamber fattened their wallets and \ntheir portfolios riding the back of all of that Big Healthcare \nenrichment, all at the expense of poor Americans around this country \ntrying to get access to a doctor without having to call some bureaucrat \nin the government, the VA, or an insurance company, or however it may \nbe, but it sure as heck isn't their doctor.\n\n  We don't have health freedom in this country. We have mandated Big \nHealthcare, Big Government, Big Insurance, bureaucracy. And everybody \nknows it. Everybody knows it because you all had to deal with it. You \nhave\n\n[[Page H286]]\n\nhad to call somebody. You had to call some kid sitting in Omaha in some \nphone bank telling you which doctor you can go to 2,000 miles away. \nThat is the truth, and we all know it. We sit in here, we roll in here \nand we say: Let's spend more money and create a government program. \nLet's spend more money we don't have.\n  Not one person in this body will come down here and truly debate any \nof these truths when you are $30 trillion in debt; when you are funding \nthe very FBI going after parents for daring to stand up and defend \ntheir children in a school board meeting; when you are funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that is literally lying to the American \npeople saying our border is secure while hundreds of thousands of \npeople come across.\n  You want to know what happened in that synagogue? Because we don't \nhave a dang clue who is coming to the United States, and this \nadministration doesn't care. They don't care. They don't care what list \nthey are on. They don't care whether they pose a danger to the United \nStates of America. They don't care at all who is coming into this \ncountry. And they sure as heck don't care what is happening to the \npeople of Texas, Arizona, or, frankly, everybody around this country \nwho is having to bear the cost, who is having to bear the burden of \nwhat wide-open borders means to the United States of America.\n  Complain about Mayorkas? We should impeach him for failing to \nfaithfully execute the laws of the United States of America, \nendangering Americans in the process, ignoring the laws of the United \nStates. And that is what is happening. That is what is happening.\n  America is poorer, sicker, and less safe a year into the Biden \nadministration, and that is the truth. Our enemies know it. That is why \nRussia is going after Ukraine. That is why China is rattling on a daily \nbasis. That is why Russia, China, and Iran are talking about joint \nexercises. That is why the cartels are emboldened. That is why there \nare people marching through Mexico from all over the world coming to \nour southern border. That is why there are people on the streets \nbreaking into businesses, assaulting people on the streets and killing \nthem, raping them. It is happening every single day in the United \nStates of America with reckless abandon while Democrats in district \nattorney's offices, Democrats in the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats in this administration do nothing about it and do not care \nthat the American people are left holding the bag.\n  Then they want to talk about taking away our Second Amendment rights \nand our ability to defend ourselves. Well, that crap ain't going to \nhappen because we are going to defend ourselves in the land of the \nfree. We are going to stand up and defend our communities and defend \nour families. We are going to stand up in defense of the Constitution \nand limited government and freedom to be able to protect our families \nand protect our States when this administration is letting this country \nburn.\n  It dares to do an hour-long press conference, lecturing the people \nfor wanting to make sure their elections are secure, for daring to say \nthat we should have voter identification when that same administration \nis ordering vaccine mandates that are causing healthcare workers to \nlose their jobs; causing healthcare workers in long-term health \nfacilities to be unable to carry out their jobs.\n  And then there is the talk about, oh, the burden on hospitals. Well, \nyou just caused 20 percent of nurses to have to leave because you were \nmandating they take a jab for something that is a year old that Pfizer \nis making billions of dollars on. Then we won't even have a hearing \nabout why on Earth we are having this virus in the first place, because \nof what Anthony Fauci knew and what NIH was up to and what China was up \nto.\n  We won't have a hearing about natural immunity. We won't have a \nhearing about the dangers and levels of dangers of the vaccines, what \nthey may be. Again, my polio-stricken father who is 79 has been \nvaccinated. I refuse to say whether I have been vaccinated. I think it \nis a principle for Americans that they shouldn't have to say.\n  My point is, there are people for whom the vaccine makes sense. There \nare people for whom the vaccine does not make sense. Mandating a jab in \na 5-year-old is irresponsible and it is dangerous. We should have that \nconversation instead of blindly walking around preaching what other \npeople should stick in their dang arm.\n  But that is what we do in the people's House. I am sitting here in an \nempty Chamber--with the Speaker, respectfully--and that is it. They are \nall jet-fumed out, leaving town. Oh, we shut down earlier. Let's get \nout of here. Or they are out at some fundraiser or something.\n  Let's have a debate on these issues. Let's seek the truth. I don't \nknow all of the truth on all of those issues. I don't know the specific \nrisks. I have read a lot about what is going on with the vaccines, \npositive and negative. But it is becoming very, very clear that it \ndoesn't do squat to stop the spread. So you are left basically saying: \nWell, it is better for you so that you don't die in the hospital.\n  Well, let's look at the data on that. But why don't we just present \nthe information and let the American people decide? Japan's vaccine \nrate is a lot higher than ours and ours has mandates. All they did was \nsay: We think it is good. There are some risks. You decide. We can't do \nthat in America?\n  We can't just go down to the border and say: You know what, it is \nbetter for migrants, better for Texans and all Americans, bad for \ncartels, bad for China, if we secure our border. That is the truth. \nTalk to the migrants getting abused. Talk to the people in south Texas. \nGo to Laredo and Webb County. Sit down with the Brown people in Laredo \nwho will say: We are pretty ticked off with this administration about \nhow they are handling the border.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might be up for a rude \nawakening pretty soon about their expectations of what voters are \nvoting for them and what voters are not because there are a lot of \npeople in this country that are sick and tired of the elite in this \ntown, immersed in the swamp, promoting Big Healthcare, promoting Big \nTech, promoting Big Government, minimizing the rights and the abilities \nof Americans to live their lives the way they see fit.\n  That is our calling as we head to 2026, our 250th birthday of the \nUnited States of America, which comes up in 4-and-a-half years. Will we \nbe able to say that we live in the land of the free? Will we be able to \nsay that we are pursuing happiness; that we are the country of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness?\n  We will only be able to do that if we stand up and secure our \nNation's sovereignty, defend our streets, protect our families, stand \nup to enemies around the world, and limit this body to the job that it \nwas given in the Constitution: limit our spending to the dollars that \nwe have and responsibly lead this country and represent the people so \nthat this country can, in fact, be great in our agreements and our \ndisagreements in a Federalist Republic where we are able to live free.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, and I will \nspeak at the end of the Special Order as well if there is time.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court abandoned women and \nbabies to what is now the multibillion dollar abortion industry, and \nalmost 63\\1/2\\ million unborn children have been killed, a staggering \nloss of children's lives that is more than the entire population of \nItaly.\n  Now, by at least affirming the constitutionality of the Mississippi \nlaw after 15 weeks, which we are all hoping and praying for, the \nSupreme Court may finally take a powerful step towards inclusion, \nrespect, and justice for the weakest and most vulnerable nearly 50 \nyears after the infamous findings of Roe v. Wade.\n  Tomorrow thousands will march for life here in the capital and across \nthe country.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), who is a medical \ndoctor, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins, and co-chairman of the \nPro-Life Caucus.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the hope that after nearly \n50 years, Roe v. Wade's attack on the most basic of human rights, the \nright to life, will soon meet its end.\n  Why are we going to be marching tomorrow? We do it because we believe \nthat every person, born and unborn, deserves a chance at life. We march \nto shed light on the incredible resources available to expectant \nmothers who find themselves in desperate situations. We march to send a \nmessage that humanity cannot sit by and quietly tolerate the deliberate \nending of human life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a physician, and I have helped thousands of women \ndeliver their babies over the course of my career. When I underwent my \ntraining, I was taught that caring for expectant mothers meant caring \nfor two patients, not one. As you can see here, advances in ultrasound \ntechnology have reinforced that training from decades ago. Mr. Speaker, \nthese are not blobs of tissue we are talking about. These are human \nbeings. The science is clear: From the moment of conception, new human \nlife enters the world with its own unique DNA, and in a matter of weeks \neven a heartbeat.\n  Mr. Speaker, we march for an end to the human tragedy of abortion, \nand I pray each day that we come closer to this righteous conclusion.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus.\n  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my great friend, Mr. Smith, and \na great fighter for life for many years, and we appreciate all of his \nwork on that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 49th anniversary of the Roe v. \nWade tragedy and to remember the more than 60 million unborn lives it \nhas taken and the tragic, irreversible mark it has left on countless \nmothers, fathers, and families.\n  Every innocent life is precious, from conception until natural death, \nbut for nearly five decades abortion has remained one of the greatest \ntragedies of our Nation.\n  The Supreme Court now has the opportunity to right some of the \nterrible wrongs committed in this country against the unborn since Roe \nv. Wade. I pray for our Justices, that they make the right decision, \nfor many lives will depend on it.\n  We will continue to fight for the lives of unborn children.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Fischbach for her \npowerful and eloquent witness for life, both in the legislature in \nMinnesota and now in the U.S. House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). I would \nnote that he is the prime author of two breakthrough laws. One is \ncalled the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, which is law, and the Born-\nAlive Infants Protection Act.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nhis long-time leadership in protecting innocent, unborn lives. He was \nhere at the beginning. The fathers of the pro-life movement here in the \nUnited States Congress were Chris Smith and Henry Hyde.\n  Speaking of Henry Hyde, we have had for a long time something called \nthe Hyde amendment, which basically said U.S. tax dollars could not go \nto pay for abortions, but we have a radical pro-abortion group of \npeople that control this Congress now. They think that tax dollars \nought to go to pay for other people's abortions.\n  They also believe that not only should we pay for abortions here in \nthe United States with the people's tax dollars, but they ought to pay \nfor abortions across the globe, and that is a reversal of the Mexico \nCity policy.\n  The Supreme Court is currently considering two cases that may \nfundamentally alter abortion in this country, and it is my hope, my \nsincere hope, that this Court will finally right a grievous past wrong \nand give the rights to the most vulnerable among us, the unborn, and \nprotect lives in the future rather than what has happened in the \nslaughter of over 63 million of our fellow citizens.\n\n  I want to thank Mr. Smith and all the other Members who will be \nspeaking here today for their leadership on this vital, vital issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to just say how much I appreciate the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for having this very, very \nvaluable worthwhile Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 63 million \nbabies who have tragically been aborted since the Supreme Court's \ndevastating decision in Roe v. Wade.\n  However, in the 49 years since that fatal decision, science has \nunmistakably proven that unborn babies can feel pain as early as 15 \nweeks. They even have a character. We can see it on sonograms.\n  But the left likes to ignore this fact. They seem to only value the \ntype of science that supports their political agenda. It is time for \nthe ``party of science'' to actually follow the science and to protect \nthe unborn.\n  I will always fight for life. I am proud to be up here with my \ncolleagues today standing up for these unborn, innocent, little human \nbeings. I sincerely pray that the Supreme Court of the United States \nwill make the just decision to overturn Roe v. Wade this very year.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bergman), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here with my colleagues\n\n[[Page H279]]\n\nwho believe so fervently in doing the right thing because if you seek \nyour wisdom from above, you will always do the right thing. I \nappreciate Mr. Smith's leadership.\n  As we stand here remembering the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I \nwant to remind my colleagues that standing for life--and I repeat, \nstanding for life--has historically been a bipartisan effort. Example, \nthe Hyde amendment, especially across Michigan's First District.\n  Since coming to Congress, I am proud to have stood shoulder to \nshoulder with my constituents as we collectively raise our voice, and \nour vote, for those who have neither.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The very first inalienable right described in the Declaration of \nIndependence is the right to life.\n  As a Member of Congress I have always and will always continue to \nfight to correct that right for the born and the unborn.\n  Protecting life isn't an issue of division. In fact, it is one of \nunity.\n  We must all work together to enact better policies and build stronger \ncommunities that create a culture of life.\n  Together, we can create a Nation that honors life and upholds the \nself-evident truth that every life is precious and must be protected.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a \ndistinguished attorney before coming to Congress and number four in the \nline of leadership in the Republican Party.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his \nprincipal leadership on this issue for so many years. He is a great \nmodel to us all.\n  Mr. Speaker, we in the Pro-Life Caucus are happy to join the March \nfor Life tomorrow here in the Nation's capital, but we are here today \nto acknowledge the tragic anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\n  As has been said, more than 63 million unborn children have been \ndenied their right to life in the past 49 years since that tragic \ndecision was handed down.\n  As we fight to protect the liberties of all Americans here in \nCongress, we have to remember to fight first for the most defenseless, \nand that is the child in the womb, who from the moment of conception is \na unique human being with unique DNA.\n  In the coming months you are going to hear a lot of vague and \neuphemistic language from defenders of abortion. Do not be swayed. The \ntruth is very simple, and it has never changed. Abortion takes a baby's \nlife, a person made in God's image.\n  We hope, we pray, we believe that 2022 is the year the Supreme Court \nwill finally recognize this truth once again.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a medical \ndoctor. So many of our leaders in the pro-life effort both in this \nCongress and legislation across the country are medical doctors and \nhealthcare professionals.\n  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New \nJersey, Mr. Smith, for his leadership in this incredibly important \nissue. Year after year he has stood for the unborn. Personally I want \nto thank him for that leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the 49 years since the case of Roe v. Wade was ruled \non by the Supreme Court, 63 million innocent unborn children have lost \ntheir lives to abortion.\n  Now, members of the radical left are trying to raise the number of \nabortions performed in the United States by repealing the Hyde \namendment, which for decades has ensured that no taxpayer dollars are \nused to fund this barbaric procedure.\n  As a doctor, I swore an oath to ``first, do no harm.''\n  When I was in medical school I swore that I would never perform, \nassist, or support an abortion procedure. As a medical student, as an \nintern, as a resident, and as a board certified physician for 25 years, \nI lived up to that pledge.\n  As a legislator in the United States Congress I took a pledge to \ncontinue to stand for life.\n  Now is the time for Congress to pass legislation that defends the \nrights of the unborn.\n  Now is the time for us to end abortions in this country.\n  On this 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade let us remember the lives \nthat have been lost and recommit ourselves to defending human life.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you very much, doctor, for your \nleadership and eloquence.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).\n  Mr. BURCHETT. We can all agree that it is wrong to murder a person, \nMr. Speaker, or in other words to take someone's life. So my pro-\nabortion colleagues need to answer the simple question of when does a \nlittle baby girl's life start?\n  Does it start at 6 weeks when the baby girl's heart starts beating? \nMost pro-abortion advocates oppose the 6-week heartbeat laws, so they \nwould not consider a heartbeat to be life. What about when a little \nbaby girl can start to feel pain around the halfway point in pregnancy? \nNot a single House Democrat cosponsored legislation that would affect \nbabies who can feel pain, so it seems they don't believe in life at the \nhalfway point either.\n  What about at 21 weeks, Mr. Speaker, when the baby girl could \npotentially survive outside the womb thanks to lifesaving medical \ntechnology? It seems simple to say if she could live outside the womb, \nshe must be alive inside the womb, as well. Yet most pro-abortion \nadvocates still say we should be able to kill her without a second \nthought.\n  Many of my pro-abortion colleagues also believe we should be able to \nabort viable babies even up through birth. Why should abortion doctors \nbe allowed to kill a baby who has developed organs, a beating heart, \nand even the ability to recognize the sound of their own mother's \nvoice? There is no excuse for aborting babies at birth, but the pro-\nabortion movement believes this murder should be allowed anyway.\n  It is time my pro-abortion colleagues start following the science and \nrealize those little babies are human, alive, and worthy of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for the incredible work he is doing. \nHe may not get his rewards here, but I assure you he will in Heaven.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Cline).\n  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his \nleadership on this issue and for yielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 49th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade my colleagues and I come together to \nremember the more than 63 million children who have had their lives cut \nshort in this country since 1973.\n  I stand here today for the sake of the women, for the sake of the \nchildren, and for the sake of the very future of our Nation.\n  Because of Roe v. Wade and the cases that followed its precedent, the \nright of the unborn to be born is denied throughout our Nation more \nthan 2,000 times every single day, and in several States throughout all \n9 months of pregnancy, which Roe permits.\n  This is a great stain on this great Nation.\n  We will not be silent here in Congress, nor will the hundreds of \nmillions of pro-life Americans across this country.\n  My colleagues and I will continue to stand for life and fight to end \nthe tragedy that is abortion.\n  We will remain steadfast supporters of life and serve as voices for \nthe voiceless and defenders of the defenseless.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nstrong statement.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller.)\n  Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \ntaking the lead on such an important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, let's reflect on \nthe importance of standing up for every human being's right to realize \ntheir full potential from the moment of conception.\n  In fact, Members of Congress have a solemn duty to defend those \nincapable of defending themselves, the most innocent among us, the \nunborn.\n  I will share a little bit of a personal story when my family chose \nlife. This was when my son was 3 years old. He\n\n[[Page H280]]\n\nwas involved in an accident with a head injury, and he was on life \nsupport. And many times the doctors told us he wasn't going to survive. \nIn fact, they said it is not an 80 percent chance, not a 95 percent \nchance, but it was a 100 percent chance that he was going to pass. We \ndid not disconnect life support.\n  We chose life. We prayed. And Freddie started to recover.\n  Today Freddie is fully recovered, and though his accident was decades \nago, this is an opportunity to learn about the value of human life.\n  Our creator has a plan for each one of us, and I will continue to \nsupport policies that ensure every life has the chance to realize its \nfullest potential.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nsharing that beautiful story about his son Freddie.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), another good \nfriend and colleague.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for all \nhis great work on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 49th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade, a devastating decision that we have \ncontinued to remind you has killed 63 million children in this country.\n  Who do we trust on this issue? There it says: ``In God We Trust.'' So \nif that is the case, this is what God said to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5: \nI knew you before I formed you in the womb. So what more evidence do we \nneed?\n  This shouldn't be a political debate, but now my Democratic friends \nare taking it one step further by attempting to abolish the Hyde \namendment, which prevents taxpayer money from funding abortions. The \ngovernment should not be using hard-earned taxpayer money to kill \ninnocent children.\n  However, I am optimistic that the fight for life will take a step in \nthe right direction.\n  The Supreme Court is currently reviewing Dobbs v. Jackson Women's \nHealth Organization, a lawsuit challenging a Mississippi law that bans \nabortion after 15 weeks.\n  I pray that the judges will rule in favor of life.\n  As the father of four and the grandfather of 14, I believe that life \nis precious, and I will fight to protect that life.\n  I have taken an oath to fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness, and so has every Member of this body.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his \ncomments.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).\n  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't believe it, but as I was \nwalking here today to speak about the value of life, my daughter called \nme, and she is headed to the hospital to give birth to my fifth \ngrandchildren, my second granddaughter. So isn't this an appropriate \ndepiction right here of my next granddaughter, who is going to be named \nGrace.\n  I used to be what they call pro-choice years ago. But I was lied to. \nYou know, they said it was just a clump of cells, just some tissues, \nlooked like a tadpole, nothing. But, you know, as technology has gotten \nbetter, we now have ultrasounds, and in our State of Arizona we passed \nlegislation so that the mothers could see what their babies really look \nlike. They have little hands, little fingers, little toes. They are \nhumans. They are real people. They are not just a clump of cells. And \nthat is why it is so disturbing to me that here in the U.S. Congress I \ndon't think we have one of my Democratic colleagues left that is pro-\nlife. I think they got rid of them in the primaries.\n  And when Republicans have come forward and asked the Speaker of the \nHouse, please, can we vote on a bill that requires medical help to be \ngiven to babies that are born alive in a botched abortion, she said \n``no.'' What has this country come to when we don't even want to keep a \nbaby alive after it is born?\n  My fellow Republicans and I are fighting hard for the value of life \nto protect the preborn, to protect every life. This is the most \nimportant thing that we can do.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her \nremarks and wish her congratulations.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).\n  Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being a leading \nexample on this charge for us.\n  Tomorrow will be a unique and significant day. Tomorrow many of us \nwill take the unfortunately similar steps of a march that began in \n1974. This March for Life however may be the last one before the stain \nof Roe v. Wade is lifted from this Nation.\n  However, even if we are so fortunate, the decision to continue this \ncrime will likely remain in many of the States.\n  Sadly, millions of Americans have yet to awaken, awaken to the \ncruelty and the evil that is abortion. The reason for this slumber is \nno less devastating than the murder of 63 million children. It is the \nfailure to recognize the inherent dignity of every life. This failure \nhas justified the intentional killing of a living child, led to the \nmany atrocities of the 21st century and this American tragedy. We, \nhowever, are not reconciled to continue this moral failing.\n  I often think about the abortionist who has woken up to the evil \nwhich he has been so complicit in. That moment when his heart converts, \nwhen he has been availed of the truth inherent in human life. He looks \nback at the trail of broken bodies that he has traveled.\n  But if we stop there at the horror and the tragedy, we would not have \nhope because we know that when he looks up he now sees those glorified \nsouls looking down on him, singing in praise and rejoicing in his \nconversion.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  There is renewal in our movement, and there is hope. There is the \nhopeful anticipation that everyone in every State will also see the \nobvious truth and the inherent beauty in the tiniest life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for including me in this Special \nOrder today.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \ncomments and leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), \na good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I may have a slightly different tone here. I was born in \nan unwed mother's home in downtown L.A., and so were all my siblings. \nIn my late thirties, I got an email out of nowhere, and it said: Hi, \nDavid. I am a friend of your sister's. Here is your information. Here \nis your birth mother.\n  We had a family discussion. I sent a very carefully worded note, and \na couple of weeks later, I got this phone call, this tiny voice \ncrying--and I am crying now also on the phone. And she is saying: I go \nto mass almost every day. On your birthday, I am terrified. Are you \nhaving a good life? How has your world been?\n  And I am crying on the other side, basically saying: Look, I have had \na great life. I got adopted by a family that brought me to Arizona. I \nget to live in the Phoenix area. I have a wonderful brother and sister, \nwho were also born in the unwed mother's home.\n  It became an amazing experience. My mom, who is right here, and this \nis my birth mom right here, they became best of friends. I have never \ntold this part of the story here, but my birth mom--both of them have \nnow passed away--had an early type of Alzheimer's, a type of dementia. \nBut my mom here had sent her all sorts of photos of me being a child. \nSo when you go into the house that they had there in California, there \nwould be my two 6' tall blonde half sisters and then pictures of me as \na baby growing up.\n  In her mind, I was always there. I was always part of the family. The \ndear Lord does heal.\n  But one of her best friends at the funeral turned to me and said: \nDavid, did Mary Lynn ever tell you the story of when we were in the car \non the way to Tijuana to go get an abortion?\n  As they got closer and closer to the border, she began to cry. Then \nthey got closer, and she started to hyperventilate. Eventually, she \nbecame so crushed with fear and sadness and terror, the girls turned \naround and went back and talked to her mother. A few months later, I \nwas born at that Holy Family Unwed Mothers Home.\n  Now I am this age, and I have an adopted little girl, who is the \nthird generation adopted in our family.\n\n[[Page H281]]\n\n  For those of us who passionately care about life, I think it is \nimportant we also tell the stories of how grateful some of us are to be \nalive; the amazing life my little girl is having and how grateful I am \nto her birth mom for giving us the greatest gift my wife and I have \never had; and understanding that the ultimate definition of love is \nlife. Maybe others out there can have the amazing experience I have had \nwith meeting my birth family and my family and my siblings' birth \nfamilies. It is just one amazing experience of joy of life.\n  That needs to be what, I think, we focus on. There is good here if we \njust change our hearts and our minds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much \nfor sharing that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher), my \ngood friend and colleague.\n  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey. It is an honor to join my colleagues here during this special \nweek.\n  Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, I approached the podium for the first time \nto give my speech on the House floor. I chose my topic intentionally as \nit is an issue that I will always champion: protecting the lives of the \nunborn. There is no effort more worthy than supporting life. This issue \ndefines our culture, our society, and our value system.\n  Every year, I am overwhelmed at the outpouring of effort, energy, and \nsupport that floods this cause. So thank you, and thank you to my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate who join me in this fight. Thank you \nto the health practitioners working nonstop to provide resources to \nhelp new mothers choose life. Thanks to our advocates on the ground, \nfrom the airwaves to in-person, for continually showing your support. \nAnd thank you to our pastors and religious organizations for seeking \ndivine guidance and strength in this effort.\n  I am inspired by you all and will keep doing everything I can to \ncontinue this fight to protect the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), and I \nthank him for his leadership on his pending bill.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey for \nhis years of unending work for the unborn. He has been so steadfast \nthat, from the bottom of my heart, I thank him for all he has done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the tragedy of abortion is the \ngreatest human rights issue of our day. The right to life is the \nfoundation upon which all other rights are built. The science is clear: \nAbortion ends a human life.\n  Studies have proven chemical abortion puts the life of the mother in \ngreat danger. In 2015, one in three women who took the abortion drug \nended up in the emergency room within 30 days. Let me repeat that. One \nin three women who took the abortion drug ended up in the emergency \nroom within 30 days.\n  Congress must do more to provide women and their unborn children with \ncare and support. I am proud that my legislation, the SAVE Moms and \nBabies Act, would prevent the FDA from approving new abortion drugs and \nwould stop these dangerous pills from being dispensed through \ntelemedicine.\n  I would like to thank everyone in Washington, D.C., this week who is \noffering their unwavering dedication to defending the unborn despite a \nculture that often marginalizes pro-life values.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), \nmy friend and colleague and leader in the pro-life movement as well.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nputting on this very, very Special Order so we can address a very \nserious issue that is plaguing our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a \nstandard of unparalleled violence against an innocent population in \nthis country. The biggest casualty caused by Roe v. Wade are the 62 \nmillion children killed before they had a chance.\n  Our forefathers believed that every man, woman, and child has a God-\ngiven right to life. Our Constitution makes no caveat for only those \nwho can walk, talk, and speak.\n  Because of my children and my faith, protecting life is a very \npersonal responsibility to me. As a Catholic, I can testify how faith \nencourages strength of character, urges truthfulness, and prioritizes \nthe sanctity of life.\n  The sad truth is that you will find many of the politicians claiming \nto be religious actively rejecting each of these faith-founded \nprinciples. The most basic way to exercise faith is by adhering to the \nTen Commandants, including thou shalt not kill.\n  I appreciate all of my friends and colleagues in Congress who are \nstanding up and speaking up for those who cannot today. I am grateful \nto know that there are Americans who will speak and fight alongside me \non behalf of millions of unborn babies who cannot defend themselves.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very \nmuch.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have always felt the 1960s was where America went off \nthe rails. Of course, Roe v. Wade wasn't decided in exactly the 1960s, \nbut the 1960s really, I think, began with the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy. You would say the end of that disastrous decade was \nJanuary 22, 1973, where the Supreme Court decided that abortion was \nlegal in the United States of America. Just a disaster.\n  Since then, 63 million unborn children have died in every State. Ten \nyears before that, abortion would have been considered illegal. All \nchurches would have been appalled by it, and all Americans knew it was \njust a horrible thing. But then, in an example of out-of-control \njudiciary, probably the most extreme example in our country, the U.S. \nSupreme Court came in and began a reign in which 63 million unborn \nchildren have lost their lives.\n  The U.S. is one of seven countries where late-term abortions are \nillegal. We stand with Vietnam, North Korea, Red China, together with \nSingapore, Canada, and the Netherlands. We are one of the few countries \nin the world, after all God has given us, that we decide to step up and \nsay it is appropriate to kill a child right up to birth.\n  In any event, today, we mourn the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We look \nforward to leaving this Chamber and marching in the March for Life, as \nwe hope that this is finally--given that there is an important Supreme \nCourt decision coming down--finally the end, or the beginning of the \nend, of this ongoing slaughter of the innocent in the United States.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nreminding us that the Chinese Communist Party and North Korea both have \npolicies like ours, especially as it relates to up-to-birth abortions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) for being a stalwart leader on this ever since I \nhave been involved in this. I appreciate him for being courageous and \nstrong on defending life.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we know, in the 49 years since the Supreme Court \ncodified Roe v. Wade, the science behind pregnancy and its diagnosis, \nso to speak, has advanced exponentially. We know this year the Supreme \nCourt will rule on a case called Dobbs v. Jackson to decide on limiting \nabortion access to 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n  As if there has been any doubt, really, of what a pregnancy means \ncommonsense-wise, that it is a child developing--not a blob, a tissue \nmass, a clump of cells, or a baby giraffe. No, it is a human being.\n  Medical advancements like ultrasounds since that decision 49 years \nago, prenatal surgeries, all these have shown the humanity of the \nunborn, which points to the value of life from the moment of \nconception, from that flash of light.\n\n  By 15 weeks in the womb, babies have fully developed hearts, can \ntaste, can make facial expressions, and can feel pain. With today's \nmedical advancements, a baby can survive outside the womb, incredibly, \nat 22 weeks and, in\n\n[[Page H282]]\n\nsome cases, even earlier with aggressive care and maybe a little bit of \nluck and God's blessing.\n  Roe v. Wade allows a baby to be born as late as 28 weeks. At 28 \nweeks, a baby is a living, breathing, developed person with thoughts \nand a future. We need revisions to Roe v. Wade. The future of our \nNation, its morality, its outlook, it depends on it. Abortion is a \ngruesome act that destroys families, harms women's health, mentally and \nphysically, and takes the life of the innocent.\n  I will always fight for the unborn, the sanctity of life, and our \ntraditional family values this country is founded upon. It is truly a \ncornerstone, and it is abhorrent that lives like this can be taken \nneedlessly when we have so many remedies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \nleadership all these many years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).\n  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this weekend, tens of thousands of men and women will \nfill the streets of our Capital to march for the lives of the unborn \nand to advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable Americans.\n  These men and women are advocating for an end to abortion, but they \nare not just seeking policy solutions. I know many of the devoted \nparticipants in the March for Life and about all the work they do in \nour communities to make sure that no woman ever feels alone or that \nabortion is her only option.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  They staff pregnancy centers, host diaper drives, provide information \non adoptions, and organize childcare for young mothers. They are doing \nthe work of making their cities and neighborhoods a place where no one \nis alone and there is a support system for every mother. There is \nsensitive and compassionate help available to those facing an unwanted \npregnancy.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we march for life this weekend, we march for a \ngreater future for all of us, one that values the unborn and sees the \npotential in every life. I am proud to support, champion, and stand \nwith these efforts.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), who is also a pharmacist.\n  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, my belief in God and my Christian \nfaith, they are the catalyst for every decision I make. Remarkable \nAmericans from across the country are gathering this week in \nWashington, D.C., to advocate for the protection of unborn children.\n  Written into the Declaration of Independence is our founding faith \nand principle that we are all created by God, created equally, endowed \nby our creator with the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. However, since the infamous Supreme Court \ndecision of Roe v. Wade some 49 years ago, we have fallen short of that \nnational edict by not acknowledging that life at every stage is \nprecious, valuable, sacred, and should be protected.\n  To the many Americans marching in person this week and supporting the \npro-life movement through other means, I want to say thank you for your \ndedication to this most worthy cause and know that you are not alone in \nthis fight. As you continue to stand up for those who cannot stand up \nfor themselves, remember that my pro-life colleagues and I stand with \nyou.\n  Mr. Speaker, I promise to use this platform right here in Congress \nand beyond to continue my vocal and unapologetic advocacy for unborn \nchildren. I will not stop fighting until our laws and policies protect \nlife at every stage. I hope you won't either.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), a friend and colleague for several \ndecades.\n  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize my colleagues this \nsolemn day. It is the day we commemorate the anniversary of Roe v. \nWade. I have said it before and continue to say, as I have many times, \nI am pro-life. I am pro-family. I am pro-child. I join my colleagues \nand constituents in Alabama's Fourth Congressional District in \nremembering the, literally, millions of babies that have been aborted \nsince that 1973 decision.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year we are possibly on the brink of a \ntransformational moment in our history, a moment of hope that we really \nhaven't had for many, many years, the reversal of or major changes to \nRoe v. Wade.\n  As most of us know, in June of this year we expect the U.S. Supreme \nCourt to hand down a decision on the Dobbs v. Jackson case. In deciding \nthis case, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to protect the lives \nof unborn children after the 15-week mark of pregnancy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all have to be clear. Even if the Supreme \nCourt upholds the Mississippi law as it is written, abortion will not \nbe banned nationwide. It simply gives the power back to the States. For \nme, my pro-life stance is deeply rooted in my Christian faith. Just as \nimportant, my opposition to abortion is about doing what is right. It \nis about protecting unborn babies. It is about not trying to impose my \nfaith on anyone else.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is because it is also rooted in science. Like much \nof science, our scope of knowledge on the development of unborn babies \nhas advanced farther than what we knew back in 1973. It is time for our \nlaws to catch up.\n  At 15 weeks, an unborn baby has a heartbeat. It can open and close \nits fingers and hands. It can taste. It can even feel pain. No argument \nin favor of abortion can overcome one unchanging fact, and that is \nabortion stops a beating heart.\n  Given developments of unborn babies at 15 weeks, abortions after this \ntimeframe often involve gruesome medical procedures that are dangerous \nfor mothers and undoubtedly painful to the baby.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, as we look forward, as we \nreturn back to our States, and as this issue is hopefully turned over \ninto the hands of the States, we can make groundbreaking steps in \nsaving the lives of the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas \n(Mr. Mann).\n  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my reasoning for voting \nto protect unborn American citizens. I believe that life begins at \nconception which is why I support adoptions, foster care, and crisis \npregnancy centers that work tirelessly to care for mothers and babies.\n  Kansans are leading the way in protecting the right to life by \nplacing the Value Them Both amendment on the ballot, this year's \nresponse to the Kansas Supreme Court's unthinkable ruling that abortion \nis a constitutional right. For my part, I have cosponsored pro-life \nlegislation including H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion \nAct, permanently prohibiting Federal funding for abortions and abortion \nservices. I have introduced my own H.R. 714 which would require the \nexecutive branch to notify Congress and the American public before \nissuing any new executive order pertaining to pro-life provisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, abortion has desensitized our Nation. I pray we wake up \nsoon and repent for the horrors we have visited upon America's most \nvulnerable, the unborn. Imagine what this country would look like \neconomically, culturally, socially, and spiritually if abortion hadn't \nwiped out an entire generation of Americans, 63.4 million people over \nthe last 50 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all of you who have joined together \nin this fight. Thank you for using your voices to defend the voiceless.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now recognize the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). As I said before, there are doctors who \nare outspoken in their defense of life, Dr. Thompson is one of those.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this \nSpecial Order to reaffirm my commitment to protect and defend the \nsanctity of life.\n  From the moment I stepped foot into this Chamber in 2009, I submitted \nmy promise to protect our most vulnerable, the unborn. In this Congress \nI have cosponsored 11 bills and signed on to eight letters relating to \npro-life policies.\n  Our Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence three \nunalienable rights. The first is the right to life. Sadly, from the \nmoment of the Roe v. Wade decision, the basic\n\n[[Page H283]]\n\nright to life has been denied to more than 60 million unborn children. \nWe don't know what those children would have grown up to do. Perhaps \nthey would have cured cancer, found a solution to Alzheimer's. The \npossibilities are endless with the loss of those lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with so many of my colleagues. We \nknow that there is hope on the horizon. The life movement is strong, \nand I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of pro-life \npolicies. It is my hope that one day those unalienable rights will \nextend to all Americans born and unborn. It is my prayer that this will \nbe the last march for life with Roe v. Wade being the law of the land. \nWhen we march next year, it will be in celebration for what we have \naccomplished for the protection of the unborn.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), a good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of life.\n  This Saturday, as many of the previous speakers had alluded to, is \nthe 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. As such, it is a fitting time to \ntalk about this administration's radical anti-life policies for which \nsome of us were caught off guard when President Biden was running for \nthe Presidency.\n  Over the past year we have watched President Biden and the Democrats \ncontinually push what I would consider an anti-life full agenda. First, \nthey gutted the Hyde amendment, a longstanding provision of \nappropriations bills that prevents taxpayer funding for abortions and \nhas saved an estimated 2 million lives.\n  Then the Biden Administration's Department of Health and Human \nServices changed the rules to essentially require healthcare providers \nto perform abortions, despite any moral objections they may have.\n  Finally, my Democrat colleagues passed a radical bill that removes \nexisting limits on abortion and allows abortions on demand, no matter \nthe age of the fetus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will always push back on their anti-life stances with \na clear and strong message of full opposition. I believe that every \nhuman life is precious and should be protected at every stage. \nThroughout my career, I have always stood for life. I will continue to \nfight against this administration's anti-life policies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today, after decades of noble \nstruggle and sacrifice, pro-life Americans are hopeful that government-\nsanctioned violence against children and the exploitation of women by \nabortion may be nearing an end, although in a very real way the \nstruggle to defend innocent human life now enters a critically \nimportant new phase.\n  Because of the Dobbs case, because the Supreme Court has finally \nseemingly accepted a relook at Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions, \nthe Federal Government and the States-based suit have new authority to \nprotect the weakest and the most vulnerable among us. Protection for \nunborn children is at a tipping point. In 2022, the Supreme Court can \nbegin dismantling the culture of death that it has imposed on America.\n  Mr. Speaker, for decades and right up to this very moment, abortion \nsupporters have gone through extraordinary lengths to ignore, to \ntrivialize, and to cover up the battered baby victim. With stolid \nresolve, they defend the indefensible.\n  Why does dismembering a child with sharp knives, pulverizing a child \nwith powerful suction devices, chemically poisoning a baby with any \nnumber of toxic chemicals--one method euphemistically called medical \nabortion--why does all of this fail to elicit so much as a scintilla of \nempathy, mercy, or compassion from the so-called pro-choice crowd?\n  Have the physical and emotional consequences of women been \nunderreported? You bet they have. I have been in the pro-life movement \nfor almost 50 years. Both my wife, Marie, and I do work with a lot of \nwomen who have had abortions. They tell us stories of agony that, just \nlike the fact of the unborn child's worth and dignity, has been \ntrivialized by the other side of this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, why are children born alive during some late-term \nabortions not given the same standard of care and respect as premature \ninfants born at that very same age? They are left to die, or they are \njust killed after they are born.\n\n  President Biden understands the gruesome reality of abortion and this \ninjustice. At least he once did. As Senator Biden wrote to constituents \nin explaining his support for the Hyde amendment, for example, \nprohibiting taxpayer funding for elective abortions, he said it would \nprotect both the woman and her unborn child. He stated at the time he \nhad consistently, on no fewer than 50 occasions, voted against Federal \nfunding of abortions. Further, those of us who are opposed to abortion \nshould not be compelled to pay for them.\n  Today, the President has weaponized the entire Federal bureaucracy to \naggressively promote abortion on demand at home and overseas, including \nfull court press to force taxpayers to fund abortions on demand \nincluding the repeal of the Hyde amendment.\n  Last September, the House passed a bill, the abortion on demand until \nbirth act. Of course, it had a different name that just cloaked the \nmisery that it would impose. That bill would not only codify late-term \nabortions, it would also nullify nearly every modest pro-life \nrestriction ever enacted by the States including a woman's right to \nknow laws in 35 states, parental involvement statutes in 37 states, \npain-capable unborn child protection laws in 19 states, sex-election \nabortion bans in almost a dozen states and waiting periods in 26 \nstates. By his words and his deeds, the President has become the \nabortion President. I think he wants to own that.\n  Mr. Speaker, this all comes at a time when ultrasound imaging has \nmade unborn babies more visible, with a greater clarity than ever \nbefore. Breakthrough research has now found that unborn children can \nfeel pain at a gestational age of 15 weeks and maybe earlier.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Today modern medicine treats an ever-increasing number of unborn \nchildren with disability and disease as patients in need of diagnosis \nand life-enhancing treatments before birth. Unborn babies are society's \nyoungest patients and deserve protection, not death by abortion. \nScience informs us that birth is merely an event--albeit a very \nimportant one--in the life of the child. It is not the beginning of his \nor her life.\n  As most people know, after the ultrasound the grandparents, the \nparents, and the friends get pictures of the child in utero. The \nultrasound pictures are the first baby pictures that are now plastered \non all of our refrigerators in great expectation for that event called \nbirth.\n  The right to life is the first human right, and it must be guaranteed \nto everyone regardless of race, age, sex, disability, stage of \ndevelopment, or condition of dependency. Life is not just for the \nplanned, the privileged, or the perfect.\n  We need to protect these innocent children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, before I give my speech on voting rights, I \nyield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).\n\n\n           Honoring the Life and Memory of Manuel T. Padilla\n\n  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today we honor the life and memory of Manny \nT. Padilla, a leader in our community and my very, very good friend.\n\n[[Page H274]]\n\n  Manny served on many boards, commissions, and organizations in Orange \nCounty, and he also served 9 years on the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce \nof Orange County's Board of Directors.\n\n  Among his many accomplishments, he was honored as Volunteer of the \nYear by the University of Georgetown, as well as receiving the Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of the State of \nCalifornia.\n  Manny's story started in New Mexico when he was 17. Then his high \nschool principal chose two of the best students in his high school to \nbe part of the Boys State program. Manny was one of those students.\n  He moved to Washington, D.C. later on and attended Georgetown \nUniversity while he worked for then-Senator Dennis Chavez. Years later \nhe attended law school where he met his wife, Betty, at the same time \nwhile working at the Department of Labor. They had four children. And \nManny had a very long career in the private sector working for State \nFarm Insurance.\n  As we celebrate his life, we know his memory will serve as a great \nexample to this next generation.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nFoster).\n\n\n                          Brandon Road Project\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some great news about \nour efforts to protect Lake Michigan and the rivers and lakes \nthroughout Illinois and the entire Great Lakes region from invasive \nAsian carp.\n  Yesterday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that thanks to \nthe bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, $225 million of \nnew funding is headed to Illinois for the Brandon Road Project. The \nBrandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River in Joliet, Illinois, \nis the last best line of defense against the spread of this invasive \nspecies into waterways not just in Illinois but to lakes and \ntributaries throughout the entire Great Lakes basin.\n  The economic and environmental consequences of allowing this \ninfestation to spread would be massive, and that is why securing \nFederal funding for the Brandon Road Project has been one of my most \nimportant priorities for several years.\n  Last year, I joined my colleagues on the Great Lakes Task Force to \nurge the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize the Brandon Road \nProject. And 3 years ago, I hosted members of the then-Republican-\ncontrolled Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for a tour of \nthe Brandon Road site so that they could have a first-person look at \nthe importance of this project.\n  This injection of much-needed funding means that we can move forward \non getting this project done and protecting our waterways, and not just \nour Great Lakes, but the beautiful lakes and rivers that define the \nentire Great Lakes region for generations to come.\n  I just wish that more of my Republican colleagues had actually voted \nfor the bipartisan infrastructure bill to provide the funding for this \ngreat project.\n\n\n                             Infrastructure\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, for decades, Americans have been asking \ntheir elected leaders to fix crumbling roads and bridges and modernize \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure. For decades, politicians of \nboth parties promised to deliver on an infrastructure package. \nPresident Trump even promised that he would be the one person to get it \ndone. But he didn't, not even when Republicans controlled the House, \nSenate, and Presidency.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  It was President Biden and this Democratic Congress that finally got \nit done even though more than 90 percent of my Republican colleagues \nvoted against it. Thanks to this new law, people in my State will \nbenefit from robust Federal investment in the infrastructure that they \nrely on every day: $11.2 billion for highway and bridge repairs; $1.7 \nbillion to make sure that everyone has access to clean drinking water; \n$4 billion to enhance public transportation; $616 million for \ninfrastructure enhancements at Illinois airports; and over $100 million \nfor broadband internet expansion.\n  Just last week, the Department of Transportation announced that $1.4 \nbillion was already on its way to Illinois to repair bridges all across \nthe State. This is the largest investment in our State's bridges since \nthe construction of the Interstate Highway System, and it is just the \nbeginning of the infrastructure investments that will benefit the \npeople of Illinois every day.\n  I have to say, I look forward to meeting my Republican colleagues at \nthe ribbon cutting ceremonies for all of these projects that they voted \nagainst.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about the foundation of our \ndemocracy: the right to vote and why we must protect it.\n  I want to begin just by telling a little bit about me. My story is \nsomewhat unique. I didn't take the traditional path to Congress. Before \nI got here, I played in the NFL for 5 years as a linebacker for the \nTennessee Titans. After hurting my neck, I decided to pursue my other \ndream, which was to become a voting rights attorney, a civil rights \nattorney. While I was in law school, I decided to focus on voting \nrights because of what I saw happening in my home State of Texas where \nit was becoming harder to vote as the State was becoming more and more \ndiverse.\n  After I came back to Texas, I worked doing voter protection in 2014, \nsetting up poll watcher programs across the State of Texas, trying to \nhelp voters deal with the new voter ID law that had just been put in \nplace and that I knew was going to deeply impact so many Texans. Then I \nbecame a voting rights litigator suing States like Ohio and Wisconsin \nfor the laws that they passed making it harder for the people in their \nStates to vote.\n  Then I was lucky enough to rejoin the Obama administration and finish \nout that administration.\n  I decided to come home and run for Congress in my hometown and my \nhome district where I was born and raised. In 2018, I ran against an \nopponent who had been unopposed in 2016. I won, and I am now proud to \nbe representing the 32nd Congressional District in Congress.\n  In that campaign in 2018, I had the distinct honor of having \nCongressman John Lewis come join me in Dallas. Mr. Lewis is my hero, \nand to have him with me talking to voters and campaigning with me was, \nto say the least, surreal. We went on to become colleagues, and I \nconsidered him to be a friend and a mentor. I know that without John \nLewis, I would not be here today. There would be no Congressional Black \nCaucus.\n  So many of us would not be here today were it not for him, the other \ncivil rights leaders, and the foot soldiers who fought for the right to \nvote. That is why we named this critical piece of legislation after \nhim, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.\n  Now, this piece of legislation is not coming out of thin air. It is \nnot a Federal takeover. Many of the reforms are intended to address \nlong-held problems with access to the ballot box for many Americans. It \nis also meant to address the gutting of the Voting Rights Act by the \nSupreme Court in 2013, and the 440 voting restriction bills across 49 \nStates that have been introduced in recent years.\n  Many of those bills to restrict the right to vote have become law in \nStates like my own, in Texas, in Georgia, and so many other States. \nWhile other pieces address the direct and more recent threat to our \ndemocracy, including the counting of votes and the safety and security \nof election officials, this legislation is necessary for us to save our \ndemocracy.\n  Yes, we have had setbacks in this fight. Yesterday was another one. \nNot enough of our Republican colleagues in the Senate were brave enough \nto stand up to President Trump's lies and to vote for the same Voting \nRights Act that the Senate had unanimously reauthorized in 2006 that my \nconstituent, a Republican, President George W. Bush, signed in 2006. We \nwere just shy of having enough Democrats in the Senate with enough \ncourage to change the rules so that we could protect our democracy.\n  But I am here to say today, to all of my constituents and to anyone \nacross the country who is worried about our democracy, that we can't \nlose hope. We have had setbacks before, just as Mr. Lewis did, and we \nhave come back from\n\n[[Page H275]]\n\nthem. The American people have sent us a clear message.\n  In 2020, 155 million Americans voted in a pandemic. They risked their \nlives to vote. That is how important it was to them. Campaign finance \nreform; ending partisan gerrymandering; and expanding access to the \nballot by creating national standards around voter registration, early \nvoting, and vote by mail are all necessary for us in our democracy, and \nthey are commonsense ideas that are contained in the Freedom to Vote \nAct. They will fortify and protect this sacred right.\n  But let's talk about what is happening in the country because I hear \nall the time from folks that voting is not difficult; that there has \nnot been a rash of voter suppression laws passed across the country; \nthat this is a Democratic story that is being told.\n  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, between January 1 and \nSeptember 27 at least 19 States enacted 33 laws to make it harder for \nAmericans to vote.\n  Restrictive laws in four States: Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, and Texas, \nimposed new or more stringent criminal penalties on election officials \nor other individuals for helping their fellow citizens vote. These new \ncriminal laws would deter election officials and others who assist \nvoters from engaging in ordinary, lawful, and often essential tasks. \nPeople in Georgia can now be charged with a crime for handing out water \nand snacks to voters waiting in line to vote; lines that were created \nintentionally by restricting other ways to vote.\n\n  Montana eliminated election day voter registration, making it harder \nfor new voters or folks who have moved to vote in that State.\n  Arizona temporarily restricted the powers of their secretary of State \nto represent them in lawsuits. And the reason? Because that position is \nheld currently by a Democrat.\n  Other States have shortened the window to apply or the deadline to \ndeliver a mail-in ballot or have eliminated ballot drop boxes and \nreduced polling places, and the list goes on and on and on.\n  Mr. Speaker, 155 million Americans voted in 2020, the highest turnout \nsince the 1900 election. The Trump administration itself called it the \nmost secure in American history. Yet, the lies about the election and \nthe attacks on the right to vote have just continued and continued, and \nthat is why I am standing here today.\n  Because of this new lie, these new laws have been passed, and we are \nseeing voter suppression taking place in real time in my home State in \nTexas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just talk about my home State for a little bit \nbecause I hear from a lot of Texans who wonder why voting rights \nexperts like myself say that it is one of the most difficult States in \nthe country to vote.\n  I want to walk you through just how difficult it is to cast your \nballot in my home State. First, the State of Texas makes it incredibly \ndifficult to register to vote. In order for me to register my neighbors \nin Dallas County, I need to go to the Dallas County elections \ndepartment, take a short course, and become deputized as a volunteer \ndeputy registrar. That is just to register my neighbors. After that, I \nam able to register voters only in Dallas County, and I am only able to \ndo that for 2 years because it is going to expire, and then I have to \ngo back and get it reauthorized.\n  After I registered that voter which I have done hundreds of times, I \nhave 5 days to deliver the completed form that I filled out with them, \nor I face criminal penalties; 5 days. So if I lose it, something \nhappens, I will be held criminally liable. If I would like to register \nvoters in both of the counties in my congressional district, Collin \nCounty and Dallas County, I would have to go to Collin County and get \ndeputized separately there. If I meet a voter who lives in the city of \nDallas but doesn't know what county they live in, because four counties \ntouch the city of Dallas, I would not be able to register them unless I \nknow that I am deputized in their county, whether it be Denton County, \nKaufman County, Collin County, Dallas County. I have to figure it out. \nThat is just to register my neighbors as a lawyer, as a voting rights \nlawyer, for me to help my neighbor get registered.\n  If a voter would like to participate in the next election, they have \nto register at least 30 days before that election day. So if, like many \nyoung people, you decide that a week out from an election you are fired \nup, you are ready to go, you want to vote in that election, guess what? \nYou can't. Because you didn't get registered in time.\n  Unlike many other States where they have same-day voter registration, \nin Texas you have to have decided 30 days out from the election that \nyou were going to get registered and, hopefully, get through all of \nthose other hoops.\n  Right now, as we speak, the secretary of State's office is citing a \npaper shortage as the reason why they can't print out enough voter \nregistration forms, despite dragging their feet for years in expanding \nonline voter registration for Texans. That is all just to get \nregistered, Mr. Speaker. We are not even talking about casting your \nballot yet.\n  So after you have gone through those hoops, after you have gotten \nregistered, you have to then survive the purges of the voter rolls that \nare going on right now, such as in 2019, when Texas attempted to kick \n100,000 Texans--incorrectly--off the voter rolls claiming that they \nwere noncitizens. It was such a disaster the secretary of State had to \nresign.\n  Now, if you survived that, if you have gotten registered and you have \nnot been purged from the voter rolls to actually cast your ballot, you \nhave to jump through more hoops because Texas has the strictest voter \nID law in the country. In order for me to vote in the State of Texas, I \nneed to possess one of seven acceptable forms of ID which does include \na Texas handgun license but does not include a student ID like my \nconstituents at SMU, or UTD, or any school in Dallas might be issued.\n  A Texas district court found in 2014 that 600,000 registered Texans \nor 4.5 percent of those registered at that time lacked one of these \nqualifying IDs. Now, thanks to a court ruling, you can sign a \ndeclaration stating that you don't possess that required form of ID. \nBut that is not often communicated at the polling place. I know because \nI have trained poll watchers to try and watch for this. When voters \npresent themselves and they don't have the required ID, they are often \nturned away.\n  If you have a disability or if you are out of town, or you just have \ndifficulty coming to a polling place, you can't vote by mail very \neasily either. To vote by mail in the State of Texas you have to be 65 \nyears or older, you have to be sick or disabled, or you have to be out \nof the county where your election is being held on election day and \nthroughout the entire early voting period.\n  Recently, thanks to the State's voter suppression law, S.B. 1, this \nhas become even more difficult. As reports from counties from across \nthe State have shown, mail-in ballot applications are being rejected at \nan alarming rate. That is because this new law requires that people \nprovide either a partial Social Security number or a driver's license \nnumber on their application for a mail-in ballot, and that number has \nto match the identification on their voter registration. This makes it \nextremely difficult for voters to remember which ID they used when they \nregistered, perhaps decades ago.\n  In Dallas and Tarrant Counties right now, 40 percent, Mr. Speaker, of \nthe applications have been rejected. In Bexar County where San Antonio \nis located, it is almost 50 percent. If these rejection rates hold, \ntens of thousands of mail-in ballots and possibly more will be \nrejected.\n  It is now a crime, Mr. Speaker, for county officials to encourage \nfolks to vote by mail, meaning that if you are in a household and you \nare married and if a spouse requests a mail-in ballot, the county \nofficial cannot inform you that your spouse can also request a mail-in \nballot if they are eligible or they face criminal penalties. And that \ndoesn't even scratch the surface of dealing with voters whose names \nhave changed because of marriage or divorce, or a change in gender \nidentity, or whose names no longer match the names on the voter roll.\n  If you possess one of these IDs and if you are aware of your rights, \nyou may still struggle to find a polling place. According to a report \nfrom the Leadership Conference Education Fund, 750 polling places have \nbeen closed in\n\n[[Page H276]]\n\nTexas since 2012. This has disproportionately happened in counties with \nlarge Black and Latino populations.\n  The law also curbed other initiatives by counties to make voting \neasier. That happened during the pandemic, including limiting ballot \ndrop boxes, banning counties from drive-through voting, and opening 24-\nhour voting locations as they did in Harris County where Houston is. \nThey even tried to ban Sunday morning early voting to stop souls to the \npolls until they had too much outrage and they had to back off.\n  Texans in minority communities disproportionately face long lines \nwhen they get to the polling place in order to vote. This includes one \nBlack man in Houston who waited 6 hours to cast his ballot in 2020.\n  If you make it through all of those hurdles: register to vote, cast \nyour ballot by mail or in person via early voting or on election day, \nyour vote will then be diluted through aggressive partisan \ngerrymandering at the State house, State senate, and congressional \nlevel.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, Texas Democrats would \nhave to win 58 percent of the vote to be favored to carry more than 37 \npercent of the State's congressional seats. That is a State where Joe \nBiden earned 46.5 percent of the vote.\n  According to this analysis, Texas would have to vote very heavily for \nDemocrats in order to barely break the gerrymandering, and it would \nstill likely leave Republicans with a 2-to-1 seat advantage.\n  This is all due to partisan gerrymandering, which allows politicians \nto choose their voters instead of the other way around.\n  Gerrymandering doesn't just silence communities, though. It also \nsuppresses the vote. It is well known that competitive elections drive \nhigher turnout, which is why the recent State and congressional maps in \nTexas sought to limit the number of competitive elections as much as \npossible.\n  For the Texas voter that has found a way to register and cast their \nballot, and has ignored the impacts of gerrymandering, their vote is \nstill under attack, even after they have cast it.\n  Currently, right now, as we are 2 months out from the primary \nelection for our next election, our State's leaders are conducting a \nso-called audit of the 2020 election results in our largest counties at \nthe request of the former President of the United States, trying to \nprop up the lie that the last election was stolen from him--in a State \nthat he won.\n  All of these hurdles, combined with the potential discriminatory \npenalties, are making it difficult for the average Texan to feel that \nthey can engage in an election freely. Even worse, States across the \ncountry are following Texas' lead. That is why we need to pass the \nFreedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act, just very quickly, for folks who are \nwondering, because there is a lot of discussion about this, this is \nwhat it actually does:\n  It establishes automatic, online, and same-day voter registration, \nwhich would solve our voter registration problems in the State of \nTexas.\n  It makes election day a Federal holiday, something that should \nhappen.\n  It sets national standards for early voting and vote by mail, \nrequiring 2 weeks of early voting, including 2 weekends, and allowing \nany American who wants to, to vote by mail.\n  It bans partisan gerrymandering and establishes clear, neutral \nstandards and rules as well as increasing transparency and enhanced \njudicial review. This would address Texas' extremely gerrymandered \nmaps.\n  It creates a uniform standard for what forms of ID are acceptable for \nvoting.\n  It prevents States from subverting their own elections and protects \nelection records, legislation that I introduced here in the House that \nI am glad to see included in this final bill.\n  Of course, the Voting Rights Act needs to be restored. We need to \nmake sure that we have preclearance again. We need to have a national \nstandard. That is what the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act does.\n  This is a bill that passed the Senate 98 to nothing in 2006. It \npassed the House overwhelmingly. It was signed into law by my \nconstituent, again, George W. Bush, a Republican. Now, not a single \nRepublican in the Senate or in the House will vote for it.\n  This brings me to my final thoughts. On January 6, I was just a few \nrows back from where I am standing now. The doors to my right were \nbarricaded with furniture like this, which we use to hold paper, as a \nmob tried to break in and prevent us from ratifying the results of an \nAmerican Presidential election.\n  I along with my colleagues like Mr. Jones, who is here with me, were \nprepared for the worst. These doors were locked. We didn't know if \nthere would be a way out. But we were determined to do our job.\n  I think the most important thing that happened on January 6, the \nthing I hope that people remember that happened, isn't that we had to \nevacuate the House floor. I hope they remember that we came back.\n  We came back while there was still blood on the walls, while there \nwas still broken glass on the floor, while we ourselves were dealing \nwith our own emotional response to what had happened. While we \nourselves were shaken, we came back and we voted--yes, in a bipartisan \nway--to affirm an American Presidential election. Our democracy held, \njust barely.\n  Since then, we have seen a more clever, slower attempt to accomplish \nthe same thing that those rioters tried to do on January 6, which is to \nsubvert the will of the American people. We have seen it in State after \nState.\n  We have seen the worst rash of voter suppression laws that we have \nhad in this country since the days of Jim Crow. In many ways, it is \nworse because it is not 1965, Mr. Speaker. It is 2022, and we should \nhave made more progress by now. We shouldn't be having this \nconversation about whether or not certain Americans should be able to \nvote in our elections.\n  We have had this problem since the passage of the 15th Amendment, the \nidea that certain votes matter more than others, or that votes of \ncertain people who live in certain places are inherently fraudulent, or \nthat they don't know enough to be involved in an election.\n  I tell you what, I believe in the American people. I believe that \nthey know that our democracy is what makes our country great. Our \ndemocracy is what allows us to have this thriving economy.\n  People are trying everything they can to get into this country still. \nThey are not trying to join some of our autocratic opponents. They are \nnot trying to break into Russia or China. They want to come to the \nUnited States. We are still a beacon of hope for the world.\n  When strongmen and autocrats worry about the United States, it is not \njust our military they worry about. It is our ideas. It is the idea of \nthe United States. While that idea is under attack, I believe it is \ngoing to stand strong.\n  I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to all of my constituents, to anyone who \nmay be listening to this, the fight to protect the right to vote is far \nfrom over. The Senate may not have done its job yesterday, but I and my \ncolleagues will not give up that fight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones).\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, \nCongressman Allred, for his leadership in the fight to protect the \nfundamental right to vote and to save our ailing democracy. It has been \nan honor working with him, with Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and with \nCongressman   John Sarbanes over the past year on the John R. Lewis \nVoting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.\n  As you just heard, we are living through the worst assault on the \nright to vote since the Jim Crow era. And yesterday, on the Senate \nfloor, white nationalists used the Jim Crow filibuster to block voting \nrights legislation.\n  But they did not win the contest for the soul of our Nation. I rise \nto affirm that we the people aren't giving up that easily. We never \ngive up.\n  We the people didn't give up when, after we finally ended the scourge \nof slavery in this Nation, white nationalists fought back, violently \nunraveling Reconstruction, throwing duly elected\n\n[[Page H277]]\n\nBlack people out of office, and barring Black voters from the voting \nbooth for generations. We responded by organizing.\n  Progress came in fits. It took us nearly a century, but progress \ncame.\n  It came in the courtroom where Thurgood Marshall helped to end a \ncentury of legalized segregation.\n  It came on the streets, where the March on Washington and the \nMontgomery bus boycott produced meaningful social change.\n  Of course, it came in Congress where, after considerable pressure \nfrom the civil rights movement, this Chamber and the Senate passed the \nVoting Rights Act into law, and they overcame a filibuster to do it. \nImagine that.\n  Mr. Speaker, like you, I was hoping against all hope that today's \nstory would end the same way, with a majority of Senators doing the \nright thing.\n  To those of you watching at home, to the millions of you who put it \nall on the line to save our democracy, to see the Freedom to Vote: John \nR. Lewis Act become law, I feel your pain right now. But I do not \ndespair. As Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the NAACP's Legal \nDefense Fund, said recently: No story in the history of our quest for \nracial justice has ever ended with the words: ``And then they gave \nup.''\n  Our story, the story of building a true, multiracial democracy in the \n21st century, is no exception. The fact is, progress is not always \nlinear. It is messy. There are false starts. There are setbacks, like \nwhat happened last night. But the weight of history and the force of \nreason are on our side.\n  I grew up in the Baptist Church. To quote from the book of Jeremiah: \nLike a fire shut up in my bones, I know that goodness will prevail.\n  As the elders used to say: Trouble don't last always. Weeping may \nendureth for a night, but joy--joy--cometh in the morning.\n  Look at how far we have come already. Just a few years ago, democracy \nreform was a pipe dream embraced by only the most committed activists. \nBut thanks to an overwhelming groundswell of energy, of movement \nbuilding, of organizing, the Freedom To Vote: John R. Lewis Act passed \nthe House, and it came just two votes short of passing the Senate.\n  We are not going anywhere. We are more energized than ever to see \nthis through. We must pick up Senate seats this fall to make the \nfilibuster an impossibility.\n  This is the fight of our lives, for our climate, for healthcare, our \njobs, our dignity under the law, our future. We have no choice but to \nkeep going.\n  I am reminded of the words of Dr. King in his 1966 speech in \nKingstree, South Carolina:\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes, for this is the way we are going to \nstraighten up . . . the Nation.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until somehow we will be able to \ndevelop that day when men will have food and material necessities for \ntheir bodies, freedom and dignity for their spirits, education and \nculture for their minds.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes so that men and women will no longer \nwalk the streets in search of jobs that do not exist.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the empty stomachs . . . are \nfilled.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until the idle industries of \nAppalachia are revitalized.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes until `brotherhood' is more than a \nmeaningless word at the end of a prayer but the first order of business \non every legislative agenda.\n  ``Let us march on ballot boxes.''\n  Dr. King's words are as true today as they were nearly 60 years ago. \nBut while our work must include the ballot box, we know that it also \nmust go beyond it. We must envision the world as we want it, and we \nmust do everything in our power to bring about that world.\n  Hold your elected officials accountable. Educate your friends, your \nfamily, your neighbors. Change their hearts and minds.\n  Mr. Speaker, unlike John Lewis and his generation, we are not called \nto risk our lives. We are merely called to exercise the rights that \nthey helped to win: our votes and our voices.\n  Like those before us, let us march on.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n\n                        Remembering Lani Guinier\n\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, as we grieve the demise of democracy \nlegislation in the Senate last night, I rise in grief and in gratitude \nto honor my beloved teacher, the legendary Lani Guinier, who passed \naway earlier this month.\n  Lani Guinier's life defies summary. She began her career in the civil \nrights division at the Department of Justice. She led voting rights \nadvocacy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, often driving alone at night \nthrough hostile places, like from Selma to Mobile, Alabama, to win 31 \nof the 32 cases she argued. Due to her intellect and her sterling \nrecord of accomplishment, she was nominated to lead the Civil Rights \nDivision at the Department of Justice. She would go on to become the \nfirst woman of color tenured at Harvard Law School.\n  But like many great civil rights leaders, Lani Guinier did not define \nherself by the power she held or the acclaim she received. She defined \nherself by the power she unleashed within her clients, her students, \nand the American people. Lani Guinier found her voice by helping others \nfind theirs.\n  I am blessed that she helped me find my voice. So the day after the \nSenate tried to silence the voices of the American people, it feels \nfitting to honor her by speaking from the floor of the people's House.\n  I first met Professor Guinier when I was in college. I was taking a \nwriting course, and with her characteristic generosity, she agreed to \nlet me interview her. At the time, I wanted to be a civil rights lawyer \nlike my friend, Colin Allred. That warm evening, the Sun still glowing \nin the sky, she illuminated a different path forward for me. She \nrevealed to me that civil rights advocacy was about so much more than \nlitigation, as important as that is. It was also about leveraging the \npower of impacted communities to transform entire institutions. Without \nmeaning to, she helped persuade me to become a legislator.\n  When I arrived at law school, Professor Guinier taught me more than I \ncould ever have expected, not just everything I know about voting \nrights law, but also how to become the person I hoped to be.\n  As the first woman of color to be tenured at Harvard Law School, \nProfessor Guinier showed us that being a first is not a privilege but a \nresponsibility--a lesson that is not lost on me as one of the first \nopenly gay Black Members of Congress.\n  Her scholarship sought to show that every voice belonged in our \nconstitutional conversation. Not just John Marshall, but Thurgood \nMarshall. Not just lawyers like Constance Baker Motley, but activists \nlike Fannie Lou Hamer. Not just the people whose names make the history \nbooks, but the seemingly ordinary people living lives of extraordinary \nservice.\n  While most law professors obsess over jurisprudence--what judges do, \nsay, and think--Professor Guinier opened our eyes to demosprudence, the \nlaw that emerges from and enhances the power of the people. She knew \nthat justice is not the work of Justices alone.\n  At heart, Professor Guinier was a democratic idealist, a prophetic \nvoice who called us to reconstruct our democratic institutions and \nreimagine our democratic identities. She cautioned us that winner-take-\nall elections risk converting political competition into mutually \nassured destruction, intensifying conflict and underrepresenting those \nalready underrepresented.\n  She helped Congress reinvigorate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, \nwork the Supreme Court subverted last year in Brnovich v. DNC, and \nwhich I was proud to help restore by introducing the Inclusive \nElections Act, which we passed in the House but, unfortunately, the \nSenate rejected last night through the filibuster.\n  After the Court demolished the Voting Rights Act's foundation in \nShelby v. Holder in 2013, she urged Congress to not only repair the \ndamage--as we did in the House, but as was blocked last night by the \nJim Crow filibuster--but she also encouraged us to guarantee an \naffirmative right to vote. I have been honored to answer that call by \nintroducing the Right to Vote Act, which also passed the House last \nweek as part of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.\n  Beyond prescribing specific reforms and remedies, Professor Guinier \nurged\n\n[[Page H278]]\n\nus to see that democracy was not a zero-sum war over the power to \ndominate but, rather, a delicate project of sharing power with one \nanother as equals. ``Living in a democracy,'' she said, ``is not \nsomething we inherit. It is not something we inhabit, and it is not \nsomething that we consume. It is something we actively build \ntogether.''\n  Just as the Senate refused to heed the will of the people last night, \nthe powerful did not always heed Professor Guinier. But she knew the \npower of dissent. Whether dissenters speak from the bench, from the \nlectern like this one, or from the streets, what seems like their \nweakness is really their strength. The powerful coerce us to do their \nbidding, but dissenters call us forward to freely do what is right.\n  I am heartbroken by Professor Guinier's passing. I miss her.\n  But Professor Guinier, even now, shows me that accepting myself as I \nam can help me to center the people I serve. She inspires me to protect \nand perfect our multiracial democracy. I once asked her how to advance \nthat mission in today's times. She said, ``I think that is the question \nfor your generation.'' With our democracy on the line, may we, the \npeople, lift every voice to answer.\n  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nwords.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities against Members of the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, last night was a reminder of a difficult \nbut important reality of our great democracy: The march to freedom, \nthrough thick and thin, is never over--and we have to keep marching.\n  While last night's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate \nDemocrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark \nmoney, and partisan gerrymandering. Democrats are proud of the fight we \nheld last night. The strength, eloquence, enthusiasm, and overwhelming \nparticipation of my Democratic colleagues during debate was \nexhilarating and shows the passion we feel about this issue.\n  Facing an uphill battle from the start, we lost the vote. But to have \nnot voted would have been a far greater loss, a loss for our Democratic \nParty, which for generations has stood for voting rights; a loss for \nthe civil rights advocates who have sacrificed so much on this issue; \nand a loss for the American people and what this country stands for. On \nan issue this important, not doing everything we could would have been \nunacceptable.\n  Now, the bromides of the beltway class hold we should not have held a \nvote on voting rights if the outcome was not certain. They are wrong. \nImagine telling Dr. King not to march from Selma to Montgomery because \nhe could not be sure what obstacles awaited him and his fellow freedom \nfighters. Imagine telling John Lewis he should never have crossed the \nPettus Bridge because it was unclear what perils awaited him on the \nother side.\n  Every Member of this body who has ever invoked these great titans of \nfreedom has an obligation--an obligation--to uphold their legacies not \njust with words but with actions. Senators were elected to vote. The \nexamples of Dr. King, of John Lewis inspire us, give us strength, and \nshow us that sometimes the only right option is to move forward.\n  And we need to remember what this is about. With the advent of Donald \nTrump and his many Big Lies, with the January 6 insurrection, with the \nvicious acts of voter suppression throughout the States, and with the \ngreedy dark money interests that fuel the Republican Party these days, \nthis is a fight for the soul of America--nothing less. So Democrats \nwill not shy away from an uphill fight; we will continue to face them.\n  And I believe that the lessons of history are clear: When \nRepresentatives have to take a stand, when they have to show to the \nAmerican people where they are on the issues, the right side of history \nultimately prevails. We know history is on the side of voting rights, \nand we know that forcing leaders to take stands will ultimately move \nthe ball forward.\n  Now, finally, I want to thank all my colleagues who came to the floor \nyesterday to speak valiantly in defense of voting rights and for \nworking assiduously for months on this vital issue: Senators Klobuchar \nand Merkley, Booker, Schatz, Senator Kaine--you, Mr. President--\nSenators King, Tester, Warnock, Ossoff, Durbin, Padilla, Leahy--and so \nmany, so many more. Their leadership, their expertise, and their \ndedication to protecting our democracy is inspiring. It gives our \ncaucus strength, and it made such a difference. Last night was unusual \nand exhilarating because we fought the good fight.\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\n  As former Majority Leader Alben Barkley of Kentucky said 80 years ago \nthis November, facing a filibuster, which successfully blocked anti-\npoll tax legislation--the majority leader, Alben Barkley, from \nKentucky, said:\n\n       I am glad I have made this fight. I have made it in behalf \n     of what I believe to be the broad and true foundations of a \n     true democracy.\n\n  Senate Democrats fighting for voting rights is not over. We will keep \nfighting until voting rights are protected for every single American. \nAnd one day--hopefully, sooner rather than later--we will succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For 49 years, \nthe March for Life has united people from diverse backgrounds, \ndifferent faiths, and all 50 States to celebrate the dignity of human \nlife and confront the ways our society fails to protect it.\n  This year, the marchers will arrive in a Washington controlled by a \nDemocratic Party that has grown increasingly radical on this issue. \nToday's Democrats work overtime to keep our country one of just seven \nnations on the planet that have abortion on demand even after the \nunborn children can feel pain. Our shameful company includes China and \nNorth Korea. Fewer than 30 percent of Americans endorse this view, but \nDemocrats have made it party dogma.\n  On President Biden's watch, Washington Democrats have even turned \nagainst the longstanding bipartisan Hyde Amendment. Both parties used \nto agree that at least Federal taxpayers should not be forced to fund \nabortions. Now Democrats on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue declared \nwar on even this.\n  So I warmly welcome the marchers from Kentucky and across the \ncountry. This radical version of the Democratic Party needs to hear \nyour voices now more than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Today marks exactly 1 year since President Biden \nbecame our fourty-sixth President. This all-Democratic government has \nhad 365 days to start delivering on some of their core promises.\n  So what were those promises, in their own words? ``Crushing the \nvirus,'' ``strengthen[ing] our alliances,'' and, above all else, \n``lower[ing] the temperature'' and reuniting a divided country.\n  Remember, upon taking office, this administration had historic \ntailwinds at its back. President Biden inherited lifesaving vaccines \nand a distribution system that was already up and running. He inherited \na string of bipartisan rescue packages, including one that was only \njust a few days old. He inherited an economy that was prime for a \nroaring comeback. Those were the promises. That was the inheritance.\n  So let's take a look at the progress report. Last spring, against \nexpert advice, the Biden administration dumped another mountain of \nborrowed cash on an already white-hot economy. As a result, we are now \nbeing hammered by the worst inflation in 40 years. Practically \neverything families need and want have gotten much, much more \nexpensive. Constant shortages disrupt family shopping. Households are \nbeing hit with soaring heating costs if they stay home and soaring gas \nprices if they go out. Our economic trajectory looks shakier today than \nit did when Democrats were sworn in.\n  Of course, we have continued adding back jobs from COVID lockdowns. \nThat was certainly going to happen. But job creation has massively \nunderperformed Democrats' own projections for job creation with their \nsuper costly springtime stimulus package.\n  When 2021 was said and done, the country had added roughly the same \nnumber of jobs that we were on track to create before Democrats \nimplemented one policy or spent one dime. They managed to literally \nblow $1.9 trillion but only barely beat the starting trajectory they \ninherited.\n  They call that spending a COVID package, but less than 10 percent of \nthe money went to the actual medical fight, and that certainly shows.\n  Americans are entering their third year of this pandemic with too few \ntests, too few treatments, too many new cases, and too many school \nclosures; muddled guidance on boosters that caused FDA experts to \nresign in protest, and needless divisive vaccine mandates that were not \neven constitutional.\n  One year in, the coronavirus is decidedly uncrushed.\n  And COVID wasn't the only epidemic sweeping American streets. Take \nviolent crime. Far-left rhetoric and anti-law-enforcement local \npolicies have led major cities to set all-time records for homicide in \n2021.\n  Or take fentanyl. This deadly imported poison was the leading cause \nof death for Americans aged 18 to 45, last year. The No. 1 killer of \nAmericans in their prime--fentanyl.\n  So why aren't Democrats treating this like an emergency? When was the \nlast time President Biden even talked about this?\n  And drug deaths are not the only consequence of our weak borders.\n  Candidate Biden's rhetoric incentivized a historic flood of illegal \nimmigration, and then President Biden's weak policies lit the fuse. The \nresult? The biggest surge in illegal border crossings in 60 years--60 \nyears.\n  All these issues are priorities for American families, but the Biden \nadministration spent most of 2021 focused on none of those. Washington \nDemocrats spent months chasing a reckless taxing-and-spending spree \npacked with far-left policies that citizens never wanted. We spent half \nof 2021 trying and failing to blow $5 trillion on windmills and \nwelfare.\n  When that effort faded, Democrats abruptly pivoted and started \nshouting that American democracy was on death's door. They \npropagandized that some evil anti-voting conspiracy was sweeping \nAmerica, and the only solution to this grand crisis was a gigantic \npartisan election takeover bill that Democrats had conveniently written \nyears before the events which they say now prompted it.\n  The American people didn't buy the fake hysteria. One-half of one \npercent of the country thinks election laws are our top issue. In fact, \nmore Americans believe voting laws are too loose than too tight.\n  Oh, but Democrats went all in on this obsession. A few days ago, the \nsitting President of the United States called millions of Americans his \ndomestic enemies and analogized--analogized--U.S. Senators to Jefferson \nDavis.\n  Well, last night, the fake panic drove 48 Senate Democrats to walk \nthe plank on a failed effort to shatter the Senate itself for short-\nterm power. And now Washington Democrats appear to be launching an \nabsurd and reckless campaign to delegitimize the next election in \nadvance, in case they lose it. Sound familiar?\n  Yesterday, the President told reporters that he might not accept the \n2022 election results as legitimate if his election takeover bills do \nnot pass Congress first. It all sounds eerily familiar.\n  This morning, the House majority whip followed suit. He was asked if \nthe legitimacy of our elections is contingent on Washington Democrats \npassing these bills, and he replied: ``I am absolutely concerned about \nthat.''\n  The Democrats who preached countless sermons about accepting voter \ndecisions are now saying the midterms may be illegitimate, unless they \nwin.\n  So America, after all of this, do you feel unified? Do you feel \nhealed? Do you feel like our core institutions are being protected?\n  Now, Senate Republicans have met this administration more than \nhalfway. In 2021, the Senate built and passed a major infrastructure \nbill. We passed bipartisan legislation on competing with China.\n  But beyond that, this administration deliberately chose to build \ntheir whole\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\ngoverning strategy around the party-line reconciliation process.\n  So the President cannot deflect blame for his disappointing first \nyear. The American people know where the buck stops, and if our \nDemocratic friends do not change course, before long, the buck will \nstop somewhere else.\n  Now, on a related matter, President Biden also campaigned on \nstrengthening America's partnerships and renewing our global \nleadership. Well, how has the administration done?\n  The administration that campaigned on restoring alliances abandoned a \ncoalition of loyal partners with its disastrous and fatal retreat from \nAfghanistan.\n  The Biden administration green-lit Vladimir Putin's Nord Stream 2 \npipeline, and the Democrats blocked us from sanctioning it. This \npipeline will help Putin gain even more leverage over Western Europe \nand, of course, further isolate Ukraine.\n  As we speak--right now--Putin has amassed more than 100,000 Russian \ntroops along the border of Ukraine. If these forces cross into Ukraine, \nit will not be a new invasion or a ``re-invasion.'' It will represent a \nmajor escalation of an ongoing occupation.\n  Ukraine has been fighting a Russian-backed war on its own now for \n8 years. Eight years ago, I tried to warn President Obama that Putin is \nonly deterred when the world imposes real costs--real costs--on his \nmisbehavior.\n\n  But the Biden Administration sent Ukraine nonlethal support, and the \nsanctions it imposed and coordinated proved not to be as tough as \nadvertised. The Obama-Biden administration failed to end Putin's \ninvasion or compel compliance with the Minsk accords. Now the Biden-\nHarris team must not repeat the Obama-Biden grave mistakes.\n  But yesterday, on live television, President Biden telegraphed \npassivity--telegraphed passivity--and weakness, exactly when our allies \ncan least afford it. Our President seemed to state--and, I pray, \nunintentionally--that he expects Putin to escalate in Ukraine, and, in \nany case, Putin can do what he wants.\n  Here is what the President said: ``That decision is totally, solely, \ncompletely a Putin decision. . . . I suspect it matters which side of \nthe bed he gets up on.''\n  What on Earth does that mean?\n  Further, the President said: ``My guess is he will move in.''\n  The President said: ``My guess is he will move in. He has to do \nsomething.''\n  So President Biden thinks Putin has to do something. What does that \neven mean? Why is our President speculating like a passive observer on \nthe sidelines?\n  He isn't a pundit. He isn't Putin's psychoanalyst. He is the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So will America hold Russia accountable if it escalates? Here was the \nmessage from our Commander in Chief: ``It depends on what Russia does. \nIt's one thing if it's a minor incursion''--a minor incursion--``and \nthen we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et \ncetera.''\n  ``It is one thing if it is a minor incursion''? Does this mean \nPresident Biden will not actually authorize the tough response that his \nown administration officials have spent weeks--weeks--promising?\n  This was a moment to deliver a powerful warning to the Kremlin that \nUkraine's sovereignty is inviolable; that we would stand with her \npeople; that the cost of escalation would be devastating.\n  It was a moment to reassure our partners in Kiev and our allies along \nNATO's eastern flank that America had their back.\n  It was a moment to call for NATO's unity, not to expose and appear \nhamstrung by NATO's divisions. It was a bizarre and devastating \nperformance--especially, I would add--for our friends on the \nfrontlines.\n  President Zelensky's Defense Minister has already shot back. This is \nfrom Ukraine's Defense Minister:\n\n       We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with \n     quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This \n     aggression was [already] there since 2014. This is the fact.\n\n  I suspect our own Secretary of State, who is in Europe to meet with \nour allies and the Russian Foreign Minister--was also shocked by what \nthe President had said. Minutes later, White House staff put out a \nfrantic statement laying out a completely different position than what \nPresident Biden had just expressed. By then, of course, significant \ndamage had been done.\n  But, alas, the damage can be undone. The President of the United \nStates is never powerless. President Biden needs to clean up his \nremarks. He needs to clearly state American resolve and clearly \ndemonstrate American leadership. He should call President Zelensky and \nNATO's allies most threatened by Russian aggression. He should rally \nallies and partners around the world to defend Ukraine and the \ninternational system that is being threatened by Putin.\n  His administration should be using every waking moment right now--\nright now--to expedite our delivery of real defensive capabilities to \nUkraine.\n  The President must cut the indecision and redtape that has slowed us \nand our partners down. President Biden should finally, at long last, \nget around to nominating an Ambassador to Ukraine, a position he has \nleft empty for 12 crucial months.\n  He should send U.S. forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank--not if--\nnot if and when Putin escalates, but right now, before it is too late.\n  He should encourage our treaty allies to do likewise. But while \nalliance unity is important, the lowest common denominator of NATO's \nmost nervous members cannot be allowed to restrict American action.\n  Whatever course other nations choose to chart, we cannot afford to \nlet Moscow underestimate our resolve to impose serious--serious--\ncrushing costs in response to any further incursion against Ukraine.\n  Our friends and America's reputation deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Republican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, tomorrow, the streets of our Nation's \nCapital will be filled with Americans from across the country who have \ncome to Washington, DC, to march for life. They come to nudge the \nconscience of our Nation, to remind all of us that every day in this \ncountry, baby girls and boys are being killed by abortion.\n  The March for Life, of course, is just one small facet of the pro-\nlife movement, which works every day in this country to offer help and \nhope to moms in need. Pro-lifers collect supplies for pregnant moms. \nThey pay for prenatal care. They assist moms with housing. They help \nmoms continue with their schooling or find employment. They provide a \nlistening ear to support a mom going through a difficult time.\n  The March for Life is just one small facet of that work, but it is an \nimportant one because abortion is an injustice that happens behind \nclosed doors. It is not something that we see happening, and so it is \nall too easy to forget that every day in this country, hundreds of \nbabies are being killed by abortion.\n  The CDC reports that almost 630,000 babies were killed by abortion in \n2019 alone--630,000. That number is so big, it is almost unfathomable. \nTo put 630,000 in some kind of perspective, that is equivalent to \nroughly 70 percent of the population of my State of South Dakota killed \nin 1 year--630,000 unique, unrepeatable human beings; future doctors, \nnurses, farmers and teachers and plumbers and busdrivers and research \nscientists, beloved sisters and brothers and nieces and nephews, future \nmoms and dads. That is a lot of lives lost.\n  So events like the March for Life are fundamentally important because \nthey provide a public witness to the truth about abortion. They remind \nall of us of what can be all too easy to minimize or ignore or forget, \nand that is that in this country, we are denying our most vulnerable \ncitizens their most basic right.\n  You would think by now that we would have learned our lesson about \ndeciding that one group of human beings is expendable; about deciding \nthat some human beings are excluded from the protection and dignity \nthat every member of the human family should enjoy. Unfortunately, \nhistory makes clear that great sins are often repeated. But we don't \nhave to stay silent in the face of them. Indeed, we\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nmust not stay silent in the face of them.\n  ``Rescue those being led away to death,'' it says in the Book of \nProverbs. ``[H]old back those staggering towards slaughter. If you say, \n`But we knew nothing about this,' does not he who weighs the heart \nperceive it? . . . Will he not repay everyone according to what they \nhave done?''\n  The March for Life helps make sure that we can never offer the excuse \n``But we knew nothing about this'' and reminds us of our responsibility \nto speak up to rescue the babies in this country who are being led away \nto death mere weeks or months after their life has begun.\n  Those who would defend a supposed right to abortion would like \nAmericans to believe that the decision that legalized abortion in this \ncountry is settled law, but the truth is, it is not. If it were settled \nlaw, the Supreme Court wouldn't regularly be asked to rule on abortion \nlegislation.\n  There is a reason why Roe v. Wade has never taken on the character of \nsettled law, and that is because it was a fundamentally wrongheaded \ndecision; a decision in tension with our most basic beliefs as \nAmericans--that every person is endowed by our Creator with certain \nunalienable rights. Chief among them is the right to life.\n  Americans are not a perfect people. We have made some very grave \nerrors in our past. But Americans are fundamentally a good people. \nWhile we have not always fully realized the promise of our \nDeclaration--the promise of protection for the unalienable rights of \nevery person--it is something we keep fighting for and pursuing.\n  We really believe in the right to life and liberty and to the pursuit \nof happiness, and we have the sentiments to go with that: a strong \nsense of justice, a passion for the right, an instinct to protect the \nvulnerable. So the idea of killing innocent, vulnerable human beings is \nnot something we can easily make our peace with. So it is not \nsurprising to me that, despite the best efforts of the pro-abortion \nmovement, a strong majority of Americans support restrictions on \nabortion.\n  An Associated Press poll from this June found that 65 percent of \nAmericans believe that abortion should generally be illegal in the \nsecond trimester, or from about 13 weeks of pregnancy, while a whopping \n80 percent--80 percent--of Americans believe that abortion should \ngenerally be illegal in the third trimester.\n  Americans know that abortions kill babies. The pro-abortion movement \ncan talk all it wants about blobs of tissue or products of conception; \nscience and technology and common sense point inexorably to the \nhumanity of the unborn child. And Americans know that human beings \ndeserve to be protected even when they are small or weak or \nvulnerable--especially when they are small or weak or vulnerable.\n  It is reprehensible that a country like ours, dedicated to the \ndefense of human rights, has some of the most extreme abortion laws in \nthe world. We are part of just a tiny handful of countries that allow \nelective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Among those other \ncountries are China and North Korea--not exactly the kind of company we \nwant to be keeping when it comes to protecting human rights.\n  It is time for us to do better. We can do better. And I am so \ngrateful for all of the marchers and for all those in the pro-life \nmovement who are out there fighting to ensure that we do better.\n  ``Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,'' it says in \nthe Book of Proverbs. Thank you to all those who are speaking up \ntomorrow. Keep speaking up, and I am confident that sooner or later, \nlife will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, January 20, be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 401\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this weekend is the anniversary of the \nlandmark Roe v. Wade decision. It is a decision that, without a doubt, \nchanged lives for the better. It prevented a lot of harm and helped \nkeep many patients healthy. It opened doors for women to pursue their \ncareer and education goals and affirmed the right to control our own \nbodies and our own futures.\n  Roe was a giant leap forward, and a majority of Americans want to \nprotect it. But since Roe was decided, extreme Republicans have peddled \nblatant misinformation, filled our judicial system with anti-abortion \njudges, and passed State laws designed solely to make it harder to get \nabortions--laws that are now hurting people of color, the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity, immigrants, young people, people with low incomes, and \npeople with disabilities the most. And they are not stopping at \nabortion. They are pushing to make it harder to get birth control and \ndefund family planning clinics--including Planned Parenthood--which \nprovide critical healthcare for so many communities.\n  In Texas, Republicans have passed, and the Supreme Court green-lit, a \nlaw that essentially bans abortions and is enforced by pitting neighbor \nagainst neighbor. And even though medication abortion pills are safe to \ntake at home, extreme Republicans are now pushing to pass laws that not \nonly dictate what happens in a doctor's office but also make it harder \nfor patients to take a pill in their very own living room.\n  You know, Republicans do like to talk about Big Government, but \noverriding people's individual decisions and science to dictate what \npeople can do in their own homes sounds like a lot of overreach.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is here with a bill today that has one \ngoal: to make it harder to get abortion care by allowing someone else's \npersonal beliefs, rather than a patient's best interest, to determine a \npatient's care. And that is just one example of the extreme agenda \nRepublicans are pushing, today and every day.\n  I have heard from so many people about the problems and the harm this \nhas caused in their lives. I have heard from many patients who had to \njump through unnecessary or even harmful hoops to get the abortion care \nthey needed: patients who had to endure invasive ultrasounds that were \nmedically unnecessary before they could get an abortion; patients who \nwere harassed going in and out of a clinic; patients who had to drive \nhours or even days to get to the nearest abortion provider or who \nzeroed out their bank account to afford a plane ticket or childcare; \npatients, including many in Texas, who didn't have the means to get the \nabortion care they needed and were forced to stay pregnant when they \ndid not want to be.\n  And then the Supreme Court took on a direct challenge to Roe that \nthreatens the constitutional right to abortion. I have heard nonstop \nfrom people who are very anxious about their future, people who are \nscared and frustrated, people who, like the majority of Americans, want \nto protect Roe, who want to live in a country where everyone can make \ntheir own decisions about pregnancy and parenting--free from political \ninterference.\n  That is exactly why I am fighting so hard to protect the right to \nabortion at the Federal level by passing the Women's Health Protection \nAct. That bill will safeguard Roe and help make its promises a reality \nfor everyone, no matter their ZIP Code, by ensuring their \nconstitutional right to abortion is not undermined by State abortion \nbans and restrictions.\n  But Republican attacks from every angle, like the one we will witness \nnow, means there is no one easy fix.\n  We have got to do everything we can to undo the damage the extreme \nRepublicans have caused in our laws and in our lives. And that is why I \nam fighting so hard for the over-the-counter birth control and to make \nhealth insurance companies follow the law rather than forcing patients \nto pay out of pocket for contraception.\n  It is why I am fighting to make a historic investment in title X \nfamily planning centers, which help make healthcare like birth control, \nSTI screenings, and more available to everyone, regardless of their \nincome.\n  And it is why I am asking for everyone to join me in this fight. It \nis going to take all of us working together to protect reproductive \nrights, and there is no action too small.\n  Share your story. Speak up about what reproductive rights mean to \nyou. Support a local organization helping to get patients the \nreproductive healthcare they need. Work to combat Republicans' \nmisinformation. Fight to pass local and State laws protecting abortion \nrights.\n  And here is something to remember while you do it: It is true that \nextreme Republicans have worked nonstop to roll back progress on \nreproductive rights and that abortion access is at risk like never \nbefore.\n  But this is also true: Since Roe, millions and millions of American \nwomen and men grew up knowing access to abortion is a constitutional \nright. Millions and millions more saw how much Roe opened doors for \nwomen and empowered people to make their own personal decisions about \ntheir body and their future.\n  The vast majority of Americans believe people should be trusted to \nmake their own decisions about whether or not to get an abortion and \nthat whether and when to get pregnant is a personal decision, not a \ndecision that should be made by any politician or taken away from them \nbecause of how much money they have or where they live.\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  We can make this a reality, but we have got to fight for it. That is \nwhat I am doing; that is what I am going to keep doing; and I am very \nglad to have so many people alongside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I guess I am one of those extreme \nRepublicans that believe that a child who sucks their thumb, wiggles \ntheir toes and fingers, feels pain, has a beating heart, has a \nfunctioning nervous system, has DNA that is different than the mom or \nthe dad is a baby.\n  I didn't think that was an extreme position to see a child as self-\nevident. That is a child. Now, I understand Americans are divided on \nwhether children in the womb are convenient or inconvenient, and if \nthey are inconvenient, they can be thrown away as medical waste, but if \nthey are convenient, they are kept.\n  I just think every child is precious, and I think every child should \nbe honored and protected. So I guess that makes me extreme.\n  The bill that I bring today is a bill that just looks at the millions \nand millions and millions of Americans who believe like I do. Many of \nthem work in hospitals, and they joined the healthcare profession and \ngot a medical degree because they wanted to save life. They wanted to \nbe a part of protecting individuals at their most critical times, but \nthey also had this real belief--that is a science-based belief, by the \nway--that a child in the womb is just like a child outside the womb, \nthe only difference is time.\n  Forty weeks ago, you were 40 weeks younger. That child in the womb at \nconception and the child outside the womb is just 40 weeks older, just \nlike you are 40 weeks older than what you were 40 weeks ago. It is \nstill a child.\n  For the millions of Americans who believe like that, we have had \nconscience-protection laws on the books, for a long time. In fact, \nthere are 25 conscience-protection laws on the books in America right \nnow. Many of these have not been controversial. In fact, if we go \nthrough the church amendments, when they were done, they protect the \nconscience rights of individuals and entities that object to performing \nor assisting in the performance of abortions or sterilizations against \ntheir religious beliefs or moral convictions.\n  When that passed, almost 50 years ago now, it passed 92 to 1 in this \nbody. It just wasn't that controversial. We understood that people \ndisagreed on the issue of abortion. And why would you ever compel \nsomeone to be able to perform an abortion when their conscience objects \nto that?\n  In 2004, Congress created the Weldon amendment. It is on all of our \nannual appropriations bills. The Weldon amendment bars Federal \nGovernment, State and local government, and recipients of Federal funds \nfrom discriminating against healthcare entities that refuse to provide, \npay for, or provide coverage or refer for abortions. It has not been \nthat controversial.\n  In fact, it was on the Consolidated Appropriations Act last year, \nwhich passed 92 to 6. This has not been that controversial to be able \nto honor the rights of individuals.\n  Now, there are some things that have changed. Some of these 25 laws \nhave not been enforced. In fact, these 25 conscience protections that \nare on our books right now are dependent on the executive branch to \nactually enforce those laws. If I go back during the Trump \nadministration, they confronted California because California mandated \nthat insurance providers had to provide abortion coverage. Well, that \nis not consistent with our law.\n  And so the administration pushed them and said: No, you can't compel \na religious institution that has a moral objection to abortion in your \nState; you can't make them buy abortion coverage and actually pay into \nthat system--though California is.\n  So the Trump administration said to them: No, you have got to allow \nthose folks to have the option; that is the Federal law. And that was \nin the process of being enforced until this administration took the \nleadership and Xavier Becerra, who was the attorney general of \nCalifornia, then moved to HHS and immediately dropped the suit against \nCalifornia, his old State--curious.\n  So the religious entities don't have any recourse in California \nbecause the executive branch won't enforce it.\n  Let me give you another example. There was an employer, University of \nVermont Medical Center. They were pressed with a lawsuit against them \nfor knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly violating the Church \namendments. They had nurses that were there that said: I have a \nconscience issue. I don't want to participate in abortion, and the \nUniversity of Vermont Medical Center would compel them to perform \nabortions or they would lose their job.\n  It is in direct violation of Federal law and the conscience \nprotections. So there was a lawsuit against them to be able to have \nthem actually carry out Federal law.\n  When the Biden administration came in, Xavier Becerra immediately \ndropped that lawsuit. There was no settlement. There was no statement \nabout it. Though it is Federal law that you can't violate someone's \nconscience protections, they said: We are not going to enforce that \nFederal law--though it was in the process of being enforced.\n  So the question is, For religious entities in California or for a \nnurse in Vermont, where do they go? If the entity that is charged under \nFederal law--25 Federal laws, to be exact, to actually allow people to \nhave conscience protections--if that entity says, ``We won't do it,'' \nwhat happens?\n  Well, this bill is very straightforward. It just gives the ability \nfor that individual to be able to press a suit for their own rights.\n  If the Federal Government will not enforce the law, this allows that \nindividual to step up and say: Then, I will then file charges that you \nare in violation of Federal law for this--to protect their rights as a \ncitizen.\n  Quite frankly, it is not any different than what any other citizen \nwould do anywhere else--that if they had some civil violation against \nthem that was clearly in violation of their rights, they would be able \nto go to court and be able to say: My rights have been violated; here \nis the statute. And they would have their day in court.\n  That is not allowed currently in Federal law. It has to be the \nexecutive branch to carry it out. And, as we have learned, it is under \nthe whims of the executive branch whether they are going to carry that \nout or not.\n  But, listen, this is really not that controversial in America. The \nmost recent survey that was done by the Knights of Columbus that \nactually just came out this week asked a question about conscience \nprotections. It was a very straightforward question. And the answer \ncame back: 75 percent of the individuals surveyed said that doctors and \nnurses should not be forced to perform abortions if they have a \nreligious objection.\n  Now, we are very divided on the issue of abortion, but our Nation is \nreally not that divided on the issue of conscience protections. This \nis, Can an employer compel someone to do something that violates their \nreligious beliefs or moral beliefs? And if they don't, they lose their \njob. That is the only question that is in this, and that is why I bring \nit to this body today. That is my simple request.\n  Now, this body knows, and Senator Murray, who is on the floor with me \ntoday, knows full well of my beliefs about the value of every single \nchild. I do look forward to a day that we are post-Roe as a nation and \nthe Supreme Court of the United States is not compelling every State to \nhave abortions carried out that are elective abortions in their State.\n  A post-Roe nation is not a nation that has no abortion. It is a \nnation where, State to State, each State makes those decisions.\n  I have brought bills dealing with everything from chemical abortions \nto 20-week, pain-capable bills dealing with Down syndrome children, \ndealing with Planned Parenthood, dealing with all sorts of different \nissues.\n  This issue today is very specific, though--just about conscientious \nobjectors. Should they be compelled to violate their beliefs by their \nemployer?\n  So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 401 and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third \ntime and\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\npassed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, to the Chair, we will as a nation \nprocess through this in the days ahead. This body has very strict laws \nthat cover my State and many other States for a lot of other things.\n  In my State, if you go to build a building in the southeast part of \nmy State, you have to do frequent inspections to make sure the burying \nbeetle is not going to be harmed in that area because it is considered \nthreatened.\n  If you are in the western part of my State, you can't build certain \nbuildings in certain places or carry out certain farming activities \nbecause the lesser prairie-chicken is there.\n  If you are in California, they pour their water--their great water--\nout of the mountains into the ocean because if they don't, it may harm \nthe smelt.\n  If you are building a bridge in Oklahoma, at certain times of the \nyear, and a migratory bird puts up a nest in that construction area, \nyou have to stop construction, because migratory bird eggs are \nvaluable, burying beetles are valuable, prairie-chickens are valuable, \nsmelts are available, but we throw children in the trash.\n  We have got to figure this out as a nation, and, currently, we seem \nto be afraid to talk about it or even to protect the rights of \nindividuals who disagree about this in the workplace. We have got to \nfigure this out as a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Van Hollen). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the \nDemocrats' radical agenda.\n  For weeks now, America has been breaking records with cases of \ncoronavirus. The scavenger hunt for tests has resulted in long lines \nand empty shelves. We have just had the worst jobs report of the year--\nlast year--with inflation at a 40-year high. Crime is out of control in \nbig cities run by Democrats. The southern border is being overrun by \nhundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants every single month. Our \nforeign policy is in shambles; our friends are endangered; and Vladimir \nPutin, China, North Korea, and Iran are emboldened.\n  The American people are deeply worried about all of these issues. Yet \nDemocrats in Washington are offering no solutions on these pressing \nproblems. Democrats created many of these crises in the first place, \noften through incompetence, mismanagement, and weakness. Now, under \nPresident Biden, they are making them worse.\n  Democrats just spent 5 months trying to pass the most expensive \nspending bill in American history. It was a bill nobody asked for \nexcept for the radical base of professional activists. The bill would \nhave led to the largest tax increase in 50 years, trillions of dollars \nin new spending and new debt, and even higher inflation.\n  Democrats tried to pass this on the narrowest of margins. Democrats \nfailed. As soon as the bill was pronounced dead, Democrats scrambled to \nchange the subject. Democrats know they can't solve the inflation \ncrisis, the supply chain crisis, the coronavirus crisis, or any of the \nother disasters created by the Biden administration. By ignoring these \nproblems, they are practically admitting that, as Democrats, they have \nno solutions.\n  So what are they doing instead?\n  Well, they have tried to manufacture another crisis. They have \ninvented a phony moral panic about election laws. Joe Biden and Kamala \nHarris have repeatedly lied about our elections. They got Major League \nBaseball to move the All-Star Game to a Democrat State. They got \nHollywood stars and journalists and wealthy corporations to parrot \ntheir talking points. Now they have former Presidents Obama and Clinton \ngetting involved. It has been a shameful effort to frighten the \nAmerican people and further divide our Nation.\n  When Joe Biden was a Presidential candidate, he said he would ``heal \nthe country.'' He said he would ``restore the soul of the nation.'' \nJust 1 year into his Presidency, we have found out that that was all \nfor show. Joe Biden has been one of the most divisive and partisan \nPresidents in American history, and, today, he is on track to be the \nleast popular President in modern times.\n  I understand why Democrats are desperate to change the subject. Yet \nDemocrats are failing on the election issue as well. If Democrats think \nthey can win on the idea of a Federal election takeover, they are \nwrong. Joe Biden is so unpopular in Georgia he couldn't even get Stacey \nAbrams to show up to his rally in Atlanta. She is running for Governor. \nShe is a political celebrity. Election law is her main issue. Yet she \nwouldn't be seen in public with Joe Biden, and, frankly, I don't blame \nher.\n\n  Two days later, Joe Biden came to Capitol Hill to convince Democrats \nto change the rules of the Senate. He failed again. Brave Democratic \nSenators did the honorable and courageous thing. They kept their word. \nThey said they would not destroy this institution for short-term \npartisan gain. They deserve the respect of every Member of this body. \nJoe Biden tried to push them around, and he failed.\n  The latest Quinnipiac poll has Joe Biden with a 33-percent approval \nrating just 1 year into his term in office. He has lower economic \napproval ratings than Jimmy Carter. Yet Senator Schumer asked Democrat \nSenators to follow Joe Biden over the cliff.\n  Yesterday, in his almost 2-hour press conference, President Biden \ntalked about taking his message on the road and campaigning with \nDemocrat candidates. I want to see which Democrat candidates actually \nwant to stand with him as more and more Members of the House announce \ntheir retirements because they know, and they can see the writing on \nthe wall.\n  Senator Schumer wanted a vote in this body on the Washington election \ntakeover and on changing the rules of the Senate. The American people \nhave utterly rejected both of these ideas. The vast majority of the \nAmerican people support voter identification. If you want a ballot, \nshow your ID. They support making voters show a photo ID in order to \nget a ballot. This includes a majority of Democrats, who think it is an \nimportant thing to do for ballot integrity and accountability and \nsecurity.\n  If Democrats want to fix our election laws, they ought to do \nsomething about what is happening in the majority leader's hometown. \nJust last month, the New York City Council voted to let 900,000 \nnoncitizens vote in New York City's elections--noncitizens. This is a \nlarger group than the margin of victory in this last New York mayoral \nelection. In other words, this new group of voters--not citizens of the \nUnited States--could swing and determine the outcome of the next \nelection for the mayor of New York. This is the majority leader's \nhometown.\n  Where is the ballot integrity, accountability, and security there for \nAmerican citizens?\n  Before Chuck Schumer lectures the American people about our \nelections, he ought to fix the problems in his own hometown.\n  Democrats are OK with vaccine passports, and they are OK with \nnoncitizens voting, but they are not OK with voter ID, at least on the \nlegislation that they brought to the floor. Democrats continue to fail \nto listen to and to fail the American people. Democrats are failing on \ninflation, on coronavirus, on immigration, on crime, and on national \nsecurity. By voting on elections and on Senate rules, Democrats are \nadmitting they have absolutely nothing to offer the American people on \nthe key issues and concerns that are impacting the lives of people all \nacross this country.\n  There is plenty of work to do right now. We have to stop unnecessary \ngovernment spending to get inflation under control. We need to support \nlaw enforcement. We need affordable energy. That is what people want. \nWe need to make sure that our schools stay open. We need to make sure \nthat they teach our children skills, not ideology. We need to secure \nour border. So, yes, there is plenty of work for this Senate to do. \nRepublicans have been more than willing to work with Democrats on all \nof these important issues.\n  The American people are looking for solutions. Yet the majority \nleader is giving them pointless exercises and show votes. It is time \nfor the majority\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\nleader to abandon this political wish list. Let's get to work on the \nissues facing the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 137\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, one of the aims of American foreign aid is to \nassist countries in times of need. This spirit exemplifies a trait \nAmericans and Utahns rightfully value, that of giving to those in need.\n  Yet, for many years, our foreign aid dollars in support of abortion \nhave been used to impose violent cultural imperialism. Instead of \nhelping to preserve, strengthen, and sustain the lives of women and \nchildren abroad, our taxpayer dollars have been used to harm women's \nlives and to end the lives of their unborn children, especially baby \ngirls. In some of these countries, girls are disproportionately aborted \nprecisely because they are female. U.S. aid is used not to affirm the \nequal dignity of women but to violently deny it.\n  In some of these countries, abortion is forced on women who don't \neven want abortions, women in countries like Vietnam and Peru, for \ninstance, who were forced to endure the coercive abortion and \nsterilization campaigns of the 1990s, just to name a couple of \nexamples.\n  What kind of aid does violence to women and girls? What kind of help \nis it to impose U.S. abortion extremism on countries that culturally \nand democratically reject it or contribute to international \norganizations that allow regimes to use abortion as a tool of \noppression? What kind of progress is it to encourage sex-selective \nabortion and the denigration of human dignity for both the baby and the \nmother?\n  U.S. advocacy abroad for the taking of innocent, unborn life is not \npro-woman, it is not pro-child, and it is not pro-healthcare. It is \npro-sexism. It is pro-violence. And we must end it.\n  According to recent polling, the American people overwhelmingly \nagree. Nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to pay \nfor abortions, and more than 75 percent of Americans oppose using tax \ndollars to support abortions in other countries.\n  Thankfully, President Ronald Reagan took steps to reverse this \nsupport, starting in 1984, instituting the Mexico City policy to \nprohibit foreign aid from going to organizations that provide or \npromote abortions or that advocate to change abortion laws in a foreign \ncountry. Since then, the policy has, unfortunately, been rescinded and \nreinstated again and again, repeating this cycle between changing \nadministrations.\n  Another policy that used to have lasting support is the Hyde \namendment. This legal provision prohibited the use of Federal funds to \npay for abortion with a set of exceptions. Recently, Democrats have \nabandoned this bipartisan position and have placed the Hyde amendment \nunder threat. It, too, could become a back-and-forth, ping pong policy, \ndepending on who holds majorities within the two Houses of Congress.\n  The lives of babies and the dignity of women and girls are not \npolitical footballs. Women and unborn children everywhere have \nimmeasurable dignity and eternal worth regardless of where they are \nfrom, and they are entitled to the right to life and protection from \nharm regardless of who happens to be in office from one moment to the \nnext.\n  The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act affirms this truth. \nThis bill would permanently stop the use of our foreign aid money from \nfunding or promoting abortions overseas.\n  In our laws and through our lives, we must uphold the dignity of each \nand every human person regardless of race, regardless of sex, and \nregardless of appearance, abilities, or age. The measure before us \ntoday does just that, and I urge my colleagues to support it. The lives \nof millions of women and children, born and unborn, depend on it.\n  So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 137 and that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read \na third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \ncolleague and friend from Utah and I agree on a couple of points. Yes, \nPresident Biden did rescind the global gag rule, which this proposal \nwould not only reestablish but make permanent and expand, disastrously, \nand yes, women and children should not be political footballs, nor \nshould this issue be one. Unfortunately, that is the objective of this \nproposal.\n  It is difficult to exaggerate the breadth of this proposed \nlegislation or the breadth of harm that the global gag rule does. In \nfact, it prohibits foreign organizations receiving U.S. assistance from \nproviding legal abortion services or referrals or even information--\ninformation--on abortion services even when those activities are funded \nwithout any connection to U.S. Government money. It egregiously blocks \norganizations receiving U.S. funds from advocating for abortion \nlegislation--mere advocacy--stifling their ability to champion their \npatients, even if that advocacy is not funded in any way by U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n\n  This legislation would not only codify this dangerous policy but \nexpand it even beyond what was implemented under previous \nadministrations--expanding it, not just codifying it.\n  Thankfully, President Biden has rescinded this policy. It was an \nimportant effort to restore U.S. leadership abroad, promoting \nhealthcare access in places it is needed most. It was a critical step \ntoward what is now needed--permanent prohibition of the global gag \nrule, not codification of its expansion.\n  Let's be very clear. The global gag rule does nothing to protect the \nhealth of people around the world. It blocks healthcare access, it \nstifles local advocacy efforts, and it undermines reproductive rights \nworldwide, putting in jeopardy the people who need those services most. \nIt impedes access to a range of health services, including \ncontraception, HIV prevention and treatment, and maternal and child \ncare, because it cuts off funding for many of the most experienced \nhealthcare providers.\n  Some proponents of this dangerous policy seem to claim it will reduce \nabortions or it is intended to do so, but studies have shown that, in \nfact, it does just the opposite. The global gag rule actually increases \nrates of abortion--many of them unsafe--because it reduces access to \ncontraceptives and it increases the number of unintended pregnancies.\n  In short, we should be joining other countries in addressing global \ngoals like creating an AIDS-free generation, ending preventable \nmaternal and child deaths, and achieving universal access to sexual and \nreproductive healthcare, not putting unnecessary restrictions on U.S. \nfunds that cause fear and impede access to healthcare. Unfortunately, \nthat is what the global gag rule and this legislation do, impeding \ncountries' efforts to improve global health, advance human rights, and \nachieve gender equality.\n  I oppose the Lee bill. I urge my colleagues to come together and \nwork, instead, to promote global health. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have tremendous respect for my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. He and I both \nacknowledge that the policy we are arguing--the nature of the policy is \none in which we have seen something of a tug-of-war, a ping pong match \nover the years.\n  The Republican legislation will put in place or restore the so-called \nMexico City policy, prohibiting U.S. foreign aid from going to \norganizations that perform or advocate for abortion overseas. It is \nbacked by an estimated 75 percent of Americans who don't believe that \nwe should be using U.S. taxpayer dollars especially to further the \ncause of conducting or advocating for abortions overseas.\n  He and I both agree that President Biden has rescinded that. I think \nwhere we disagree can be highlighted and traced back to the fact that \nwe call it by different names. He refers to this as\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\nthe gag rule, a gag rule. Now, normally when we think of a gag rule, we \nthink of something that tells someone who is otherwise free to speak \nthat they may not speak. It is, in fact, what happens when we don't \nallow people to live. It is what happens to all these baby girls who \nare never allowed to be born precisely because they are female. And \nmake no mistake, when we fund abortions overseas, that is what is \nhappening. It happens a lot in countries that receive our aid in the \nabsence of the Mexico City policy. Some of that goes to these \norganizations that perform abortions.\n  In many of these countries, sex-selective abortions are not only \ntolerated culturally, they are commonplace. They are excessive. As a \nresult, these baby girls never get to be born. They never get to become \nwomen. They never get to speak in the first place. That is a form of \ngagging. That is not OK.\n  Regardless of how you feel about abortion, regardless of whether you \nthink that is a baby, a human life, or whether you think it is \nsomething else--I am not sure what else it could be. When someone \nbecomes pregnant, we know that is the potential of what will one day be \na human being. Absent a death--whether a natural death or a death \nbrought about by someone's actions or by the operation of a disease or \nmedical condition or surgical intervention in the case of abortion--it \nis a person. We shouldn't lose sight of that.\n  I have difficulty accepting the premise that the only solution to \nthis is continuing to fund organizations that perform or advocate for \nabortions overseas. I reject the premise that anything we do in this \narea to withhold those funds will necessarily result in more abortions.\n  As far as the suggestion that organizations could receive these funds \nand still perform abortions and that not translate into U.S. dollars \nbeing used to perform abortions, I reject that premise as well for the \nsame reason that I reject the premise that Planned Parenthood isn't \nusing taxpayer dollars to perform abortions. It is. It is spent \ndifferently. It is a matter of accounting, but it sustains and supports \nan organization that itself advocates for and performs many \nabortions. These are, in fact, human lives, and the American people \nare, in fact, very uncomfortable with the idea that we are funding \nabortions with their taxpayer dollars, and we are doing it overseas. We \nshouldn't do that. This shouldn't be controversial. I look forward to \nthe day when it is not.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, just to be clear, I understand my \ncolleague's point, but I think I have highlighted and I want to \nemphasize again the limited purposes for which our taxpayer dollars are \nused and the advocacy, the healthcare, the contraception, HIV screening \nand treatment--world health--that would be prevented by this \nlegislation.\n  I think that is an unintended consequence. Maybe, it is unintended \nthat it is gargantuan in its potential impact, and, therefore, I \ncontinue my objection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Thomas\n\n  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I was hoping to rise prior to the vote \njust a little while ago but was consumed with the agenda in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee this morning.\n  So in lieu of speaking prior to the confirmation vote, I rise to \napplaud the confirmation of Judge Holly Thomas to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Thomas is a dedicated advocate for \nequality under the law and has made a career of fighting to ensure the \ncivil rights of all Americans.\n  A proud native of San Diego, CA, and a graduate of Yale Law School, \nJudge Thomas spent 10 years working on civil rights litigation and \nappeals. That time included litigating at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, \nin the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, and in the \nNew York Solicitor General's Office.\n  In each of these roles, Judge Thomas was a tireless advocate for \nequal justice. She proved to be a skillful appellate lawyer, an \ninsightful thinker, and a valued colleague.\n  She returned to California in 2016 to serve as the chief liaison \nbetween the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and \nthe Governor's Office. The State Department of Fair Employment and \nHousing is California's largest civil rights regulatory body, and in \nher role there Judge Thomas dedicated herself to protecting workers and \nfamilies from unlawful discrimination, working closely with then-\nGovernor Brown.\n  Recognizing her outstanding work and her tremendous talent, Governor \nBrown appointed her to the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2018. \nNow, this appointment was a full-circle moment for a person whose love \nof the law was nurtured by her supportive parents starting at a very \nyoung age. Judge Thomas's parents, when she was a young girl, would \ntake her to watch court proceedings. Why? So that she could imagine \nwhat a career as a lawyer would look like.\n  Decades later, as a judge on the superior court, Judge Thomas \nactually requested to serve in the family law division because of her \nempathy for families going through a difficult process and experience \nin court.\n  Now, as the first person in her family to go to college after high \nschool, Judge Thomas knows what it is like to navigate unfamiliar \ninstitutions. She is also the granddaughter of sharecroppers, and she \nis a passionate fighter for equal justice.\n  Since her appointment, Judge Thomas has proven her excellence as a \njurist, as a neutral arbiter, and a compassionate voice for justice \nboth in family court and on the California Court of Appeal, where she \nserved in a pro tem capacity for 6 months.\n  Judge Thomas's compassion is matched by her legal acumen. Throughout \nher career, she has distinguished herself with thoughtful analysis, \nexpert judgment, and unshakeable commitment to civil rights.\n  I know--and I am thrilled--that Judge Thomas will serve with \ndistinction on the Ninth Circuit, and I congratulate her on this very \nwell-deserved confirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

I believe we have a duty to stand with Ukraine and \nour European allies as they attempt to defend their democracies.\n  Strong language and threats of sanctions have their place, but they \nare not enough to deter Vladimir Putin. We need to take concrete steps \nto deter the likelihood of a Russian attack in any form.\n  But it is not just the executive branch of the U.S. Government that\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nhas a role to play. We in Congress have a role we can play, too, in \nsending a very clear message to Vladimir Putin that we will not stand \nidly by while he attacks a neighbor, a democracy, and a potential \nfuture member of NATO.\n  To that end, I have introduced bipartisan legislation called the \nUkraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act to ensure Ukrainian forces \nhave the weapons that they need to deter that aggression and defend, if \nnecessary, against a Russian invasion.\n  Of course, students of history remember the importance of lend-lease \nback in World War II, back when America was officially neutral in the \nconflict initiated by Nazi Germany in Europe and during a time when the \nAmerican people were of an isolationist frame of mind.\n  Recognizing the importance of throwing a lifeline to Great Britain \nand our other allies, Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the Lend-\nLease Act, which ultimately resulted in $30 billion worth of materiel \nbeing delivered to Britain and our other allies to help them defeat \nNazi Germany.\n  So, in a similar vein, this legislation authorizes the President to \nenter into lend-lease agreements with Ukraine and provide the military \nequipment necessary to protect the Ukrainian people from Russian \naggression. No one is suggesting that American troops should be on the \nground, but we are saying clearly that it is our responsibility to \nprovide the Ukrainians everything they need in order to defend \nthemselves.\n  This legislation would once again, in the immortal words of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, allow us to serve as the arsenal of democracy, just \nas we did in World War II, and provide Ukraine with the lethal weapons \nthey need to protect themselves against the Russian threat.\n  Make no mistake, America stands with Ukraine, and we will do \neverything we can, again, on a bipartisan basis--the executive branch, \nthe legislative branch--to support our friends and to defeat a Russian \ninvasion and allow them to protect their democracy.\n  Vladimir Putin's stated concerns about Ukraine are completely a false \nnarrative, particularly with regard to his stated concerns about \nUkraine becoming a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nwhich, as we all know, is purely defensive in nature.\n  Vladimir Putin has called the fall of the Soviet Union one of the \ngreatest geopolitical tragedies of the 20th century, and clearly he is \nof a mind to regain that lost territory as a result of the fall of the \nSoviet Union and, if necessary, do it by force. That is what Putin is \nup to, and we should not be confused about that.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senators Cardin and Wicker and \nSenators Shaheen, Graham, and Blumenthal on this legislation, and I \nhope more of our colleagues--again, on a bipartisan basis--will join us \nin advancing this bill and making sure that our Ukrainian friends have \neverything they need to deter, if possible, Russian aggression and, if \nthat is not possible, to make sure that Vladimir Putin pays a heavy \nprice for attacking Ukraine.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Exactly 365 days ago, we were out there on \nthe Capitol steps and heard what I believed to be an important and \nwelcomed speech by the President, where the President said he would \nserve to be a unifying force in Washington.\n  He said:\n\n       [W]ithout unity there is no peace, only bitterness and \n     fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a \n     state of chaos.\n\n  Wonderful, inspirational words.\n  But now we find ourselves, a year into the Biden administration, with \na lot of bitterness, fury, and outrage over the many failures and \nmissteps of this administration. One of the pillars of the President's \ncampaign was the promise of a strong Federal response to the pandemic.\n  Mr. Biden said:\n\n       I am never going to raise the white flag and surrender. \n     We're going to beat this virus. We're going to get it under \n     control, I promise you.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  One year later, we are nowhere close to having this virus under \ncontrol. New daily cases are breaking records, threatening the capacity \nof intensive care units and hospitals across the country. Healthcare \nworkers are once again exhausted after having been pushed to their \nlimits--mentally and physically. And, perhaps most embarrassingly, \naffordable, reliable tests are increasingly hard to come by.\n  We know testing is one of the most valuable resources we have when it \ncomes to this virus. I remember calling my Governor, and I said: What \ndo you need, Governor?\n  This is at the beginning of the pandemic.\n  He said: I need two things.\n  He said: I need testing, and I need PPE--personal protective \nequipment.\n  Well, that is another story about our vulnerable supply chains and \nthe fact that we have outsourced the manufacturing of personal \nprotective equipment to China, which is the main reason we had a lack \nof access to what we needed.\n  But as to testing, the sooner positive cases are identified, the \nbetter equipped we are as individuals to quarantine ourselves, seek \nmedical attention--if necessary--or, if all else fails, to just ride \nout the virus without infecting other people.\n  Even before taking the oath of office, President Biden promised to \nmake free testing widely available. But months and months went by \nwithout the President taking any significant action to prevent the \ncurrent testing shortage.\n  Last month, the White House Press Secretary even mocked a reporter \nwho asked if the United States should provide free at-home tests, just \nas other countries have done around the world. It looks like it took \nswift criticism of her remark to finally prompt some action. Just a \ncouple of days ago, the White House launched a website for people who \nwanted to request free at-home tests. But I am afraid it is a case of \ntoo little, too late.\n  Many experts have said that Omicron has already peaked in parts of \nthe country. By the time these tests ship, which the website says could \ntake 7 to 12 days, we will be even closer to the beginning of the end \nof this current wave of Omicron.\n  Instead, the White House could have purchased and distributed massive \nquantities of tests at any point over the last year, but it did not do \nso. Increased access to testing could have lessened the impact of the \nOmicron variant over the summer as well as the contagious variant that \nwe are confronting today. So it shouldn't take bad press to force the \nadministration to action, especially when they made a commitment to \nfree testing early on but, obviously, were unprepared for Omicron and \nthe wave of new cases.\n  Unfortunately, the President has broken another big promise about his \nplan to address the pandemic. He vowed that public health decisions \nwould be made by public health professionals, not politicians.\n  Once again, things have played out quite a bit differently. Here is \none example. Last February, the Centers for Disease Control released a \nreport that said that schools are not a breeding ground for COVID-19 \nand that as long as precautions are taken, schools could open safely.\n  Well, Congress did not skimp when it came to providing financial \nresources to the States and school districts to take those appropriate \nprecautions to help preserve the safety of our children. But the \nscience was at odds with the demands of a key political constituency--\nteachers unions, which wanted schools to remain closed even if the \nteachers were vaccinated and appropriate safety measures could be taken \nto protect the schoolchildren. We all know which side the \nadministration chose. It ignored the science and stood with their \npolitical constituency, the teachers' unions.\n  When the President's big promise of a strong pandemic response failed \nto meet the need, he shifted the responsibility to the States. He said: \nI am going to do it. The Federal Government is going to do it. But \nthen, amazingly, pivoted and said: Well, this is not my responsibility. \nThis is not the Federal Government's responsibility. This is the \nState's responsibility.\n  Just a few weeks ago, he actually said these words. He said: There is \nno Federal solution. This gets solved at the State level.\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\n  I am sure the American people were flabbergasted at the answer and \nhis obvious flip-flop. President Biden pledged to lead a strong \npandemic response when it helped his chances of getting elected, but \nnow that he is actually in office and has the power and authority to \nfollow through, he is folding his hand and pointing the finger at \nothers.\n  The Biden administration has fumbled the ball time after time. It has \nchipped away at our energy security. When you saw prices rise at the \npump because of inflation or because demand of refined petroleum \nproducts exceeded supply, he actually went so far as to encourage \nRussia and OPEC to produce more oil and gas. At the same time, he was \nall about canceling the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. Nord \nStream 2--the Russian pipeline--providing gas to Germany, he is all for \nit. When it comes to domestic pipelines providing oil and gas to \nrefineries so they can produce gasoline so that people can drive their \ncars at an affordable price, he is not for it.\n  Additionally, this administration has failed to address the \nhumanitarian crisis at the border, in an astonishingly blase sort of \nway. It doesn't even seem to get a rise out of this administration \nanymore--the numbers are so high. There are 2 million-plus people \napprehended at the border, with no real impediment or deterrent or \ndiscouraging words to keep them from entering the country illegally.\n\n  And then there is the fumbling of diplomatic relations, insulting \nsome of our oldest allies and emboldening our biggest adversaries. The \nbiggest example of that was ceding the war in Afghanistan to the \nTaliban in the most humiliating way possible.\n  So the list of missteps and failures during this last 365 days has \nbeen a long one, indeed. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was in \nnot delivering what President Biden promised the American people 1 year \nago today, and that is to be a unifying force for our country.\n  He promised, as we all heard, to bring people of different \nbackgrounds and ideologies and beliefs together and to find common \nground. It actually made sense to make a virtue out of something that a \n50-50 Senate would ordinarily dictate, and that is: When you can't have \nyour own way because you don't have the votes, then make a virtue out \nof working together and actually pass bipartisan legislation.\n  He actually went so far as to point to his record in the Senate as \nevidence of his ability to work across the aisle and broker bipartisan \ndeals, but it didn't take long for the American people to find out that \nthese were, by and large, empty words.\n  Less than 2 months into his Presidency, our colleagues across the \naisle took a hammer to Congress's perfect record of bipartisan pandemic \nresponse. That was during the previous administration. Almost \neverything we did was bipartisan, virtually unanimous, when it came to \nresponding to the pandemic.\n  First, our colleagues spent nearly $2 trillion on a bill that even \nthough it was framed as COVID-19 response, committed less than 10 \npercent of that funding to COVID-19 and only 1 percent to vaccines. But \nthat blowout, $2 trillion, wasn't enough.\n  The President tried and failed, along with his political allies, to \nadvance the so-called Build Back Better agenda. While trying to sell \nthis radical plan to the American people, President Biden continued to \nmake big promises, most of which were not credible. He said, for \nexample, that this multitrillion-dollar bill cost zero dollars. \nNobody--nobody--believed that. But here it was, the President of the \nUnited States, embarrassingly, for himself and others, was saying that \n$5 trillion is really zero dollars. He said it wouldn't increase the \ndeficit. And he said anyone making less than $400,000 a year would not \npay a single penny more in income tax.\n  All of these claims turned out to be false. And in the end, Democrats \ncouldn't muster enough support to get the bill to the President's \ndesk--again, not particularly surprising to those who have been \nobservers of the Senate for a while. A 50-50 Senate should tell you \nthat the only way you are going to get things done is through \nbipartisan consensus building, not trying to do things all on your own \nwith 50 votes in the Senate, plus a tie-breaking vote from the Vice \nPresident.\n  But that didn't stop our colleagues from turning to yet another \npartisan bill--this time, one to launch a Federal takeover of State-run \nelections. Yesterday, our Democratic colleagues brought this bill up \nfor a vote in the Senate and, of course, as we now know, it failed to \ngarner sufficient votes to pass. But no one should be surprised, \nespecially because this bill was drafted by one party in a 50-50 \nSenate.\n  And then when the bill failed, as we all knew it would, our \nDemocratic colleagues took their penchant for partisanship to an \nentirely new level.\n  With the President's blessing, somebody who served more than three \ndecades in the Senate and who railed against efforts to eliminate the \nfilibuster, the 60-vote bipartisan consensus requirement before bills \ncan be advanced--the President, in spite of his previous comments \nsupporting that requirement, the so-called filibuster--this time, with \nthe President's blessing, Senate Democrats tried to change the rules of \nthe Senate to secure a purely partisan win.\n  What we witnessed in the Senate yesterday evening was a remarkable \nshow of priorities of our Democratic colleagues. Forget the rules, \nforget compromise, forget consensus building, and forget the traditions \nof this institution, our Democratic colleagues proved that they are \nwilling to taking a wrecking ball to this Chamber in pursuit of power.\n  It is no wonder that President Biden's approval ratings continue to \nplummet. One recent poll found that only 33 percent of the respondents \nto that poll approved of the job that he was doing. After all, after \neverything the President promised, and with his dismal record of \nactually delivering on that promise, it is hardly surprising that the \nAmerican people are disappointed.\n  In addition, inflation is up, wages are being eaten away by \ninflation, eroding the cost of living, and our country feels more \ndivided than ever, despite the President's extravagant promises 1 year \nago today, just out here on these steps.\n  The man who positioned himself as an experienced, unifying leader for \nthe country has spent virtually all his time pursuing partisan ends. As \na result, the Democratic Senate majority has wasted a lot of valuable \ntime. I am disappointed by the wasted opportunities during the past \nyear.\n  Floor time in the U.S. Senate is a precious commodity. It is the coin \nof the realm. There are a lot of great ideas that occur outside of this \nChamber, but unless it can get time on the floor, it doesn't happen. \nBut rather than taking up bills that did have that proud, bipartisan \nsupport, wasting time on purely partisan bills has resulted in very few \naccomplishments.\n  I can only hope that the second year of the Biden administration will \nbring more bipartisan cooperation. Hopefully, the administration can \nlearn from its mistakes of the last year. This parade of dead-on-\narrival legislation isn't helping the American people. The only way we \ncan accomplish anything is by working together and building consensus.\n  Again, voters elected a 50-50 Senate, a closely divided House, and a \nPresident who promised to bring people of different views together. \nLet's hope this next year, the second year of the Biden administration, \nthe President will see fit, along with our Democratic colleagues, to \ndeliver on that commitment made 1 year ago today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                   S.T.A.N.D. With Taiwan Act Of 2022\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, today I introduce the S.T.A.N.D. with \nTaiwan Act of 2022, which would mandate comprehensive and devastating \neconomic and financial sanctions against the Chinese Communist Party, \nkey sectors of China's economy, and leaders in the Chinese Communist \nParty, if the Chinese People's Liberation Army initiates a military \ninvasion of the island democracy of Taiwan. Representative   Mike \nGallagher of Wisconsin introduced an identical bill in the House today \nas well.\n  I am hopeful that when my colleagues come back from recess, the vast \nmajority of Senators here, Democrats and Republicans, will end up \njoining me in supporting this important bill.\n  Last March, in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I posed \nthis\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nquestion to the INDOPACOM commander, Admiral Davidson:\n\n       Given the Chinese Communist Party's recent but long list of \n     coercive and even violent actions--a hostile suppression of \n     freedom in Hong Kong, threatening nuclear war with Japan, \n     hand-to-hand combat with Indian soldiers in the Himalayas, \n     economic blockades of Australia, genocide in its own Xinjiang \n     province, [and aggressive naval actions in the South China \n     Sea]--how do such actions impact your analysis [Admiral \n     Davidson] on if and when China would invade Taiwan?\n\n  His response to me in this hearing made news around the world. He \ncalled these recent actions by President Xi ``alarming,'' and then he \nsaid:\n\n       I think the threat [of an invasion of Taiwan] is manifest \n     during this decade, in fact, in the next 6 years.\n\n  Six years--that is not a lot of time. The Senate needs to focus on \nthis issue much more. Indeed, this issue is not unrelated to the \nactions of another dictator--Vladimir Putin--who is right now \nthreatening and likely to invade one of his neighbors--Ukraine.\n  Now, some see the defense of Taiwan as a luxury we cannot afford in \nan age of sharpened and great power competition and China's global \neconomic strength. I reject that view. Importantly, so does American \nlaw, particularly the Taiwan Relations Act, which this body passed in \n1979 by a vote of 90 to 6. Among other things, it states the following:\n\n       The United States will consider any effort to determine the \n     future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . a threat \n     to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of \n     grave concern.\n\n  The free world cannot be neutral in the contest between freedom and \nauthoritarianism that is once again underway around the world, \nespecially in the Indo-Pacific region.\n  American alliances, power, and ingenuity helped build a world that \nprovided more freedom and prosperity to more people than ever before. \nThink about this fact: The U.S. democracy, bolstered by our strong \nmilitary, has done more to liberate humankind from oppression and \ntyranny--literally hundreds of millions of people--than any other force \nin human history.\n  The Chinese Communist Party knows exactly what it wants to \naccomplish--to make the world safe for its authoritarian government, to \nexport its dictatorship model to other countries, to separate America \nfrom its democratic allies, and to erode U.S. leadership around the \nworld.\n  A world governed by Xi Jinping's totalitarian vision would be a world \nunsafe for America and other democracies around the world. That is why \nTaiwan is so central to the free world and its future. It is a \nthriving, prosperous Chinese democracy that holds free elections and \nbounds its power by the rule of law. For that reason, it threatens the \nCCP's central premise, which is that one man ruling in perpetuity by \ncrushing all dissent knows what is best for 1.4 billion people.\n  The Chinese Communist Party has already crushed Hong Kong, once a \nbastion of liberty, and the free world barely raised its voice in \nprotest. Should America and the world stand by as China does something \nsimilar to Taiwan, a peaceful democracy of 25 million people who have \nvoted for an entirely different future, that would not simply undermine \nthe security of the Western Pacific, as the Taiwan Relations Act says. \nA violent military takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party \nwould be a sea change in how the world is ordered. It would change the \nhistory of the 21st century in ways that the guns of August of 1914 \nchanged the 20th century.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S372, January 20, 2022, second column, the following \nappears: Should America and the world stand by as China does \nsomething similar to Taiwan, a peaceful democracy of 25 million \npeople who have voted for an entirely different future? That would \nnot simply undermine the security of the Western Pacific, as the \nTaiwan Relations Act says, a violent military takeover of Taiwan \nby the Chinese Communist Party would be a sea change in how the \nworld is ordered.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Should America and \nthe world stand by as China does something similar to Taiwan, a \npeaceful democracy of 25 million people who have voted for an \nentirely different future, that would not simply undermine the \nsecurity of the Western Pacific, as the Taiwan Relations Act says. \nA violent military takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist \nParty would be a sea change in how the world is ordered.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n  Taiwan is not some peripheral sideshow in terms of global great-power \ncompetition; it is the frontline between freedom and tyranny, like West \nBerlin was during the height of the Cold War. It matters everywhere.\n  Last month, the magazine the National Review highlighted many of \nthese issues in an excellent issue which laid out the arguments for and \nagainst whether the U.S. military should come to Taiwan's aid if the \nisland democracy was invaded by the Chinese military. Should our \ncountry militarily defend democratic Taiwan after the CCP launches a \nmilitary invasion of the island? This is a vitally important question \nwhich was front and center in the National Review last month. As the \nNational Review points out, there is much disagreement on this issue.\n  There are powerful arguments on both sides, as this issue admirably \ndemonstrates, but I believe there is much less disagreement on whether \nthe United States should take actions now to deter a Chinese Communist \nParty military invasion of Taiwan in the future. Indeed, taking actions \nnow to promote deterrence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is an area \nwhere I believe there is broad bipartisan agreement and support in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Deterrence comes in many forms, and with regard to Taiwan, I believe \nthere are three crucial layers of deterrence, as depicted here.\n  First is Taiwan's ability to militarily defend itself, the so-called \nhedgehog approach right here, where Taiwan musters sufficient self-\ndefense capabilities to make a Chinese military invasion very difficult \nand very costly.\n  The second layer of deterrence is America's capability and will to \ndefend Taiwan militarily should the President of the United States \ndecide to do so once there is an invasion by the Chinese.\n  Over the past several decades, through many different crises in the \nTaiwan Strait, this layer, the American layer of deterrence, has proven \nto be decisive in keeping the Taiwanese people free. Our deep network \nof allies in the region augments this level of deterrence.\n  As it relates to deterrence in Taiwan, it is really often discussed \nonly in these two layers, but there is a third layer that is depicted \nhere, which in terms of the present circumstances might be the most \nimportant, and that is the use of other instruments of American power \nbeyond our military, such as our global economic and financial \nstrengths, to deter China from an invasion.\n  That is exactly what my bill, the S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022, \nis all about. The full name of this bill is Sanctions Targeting \nAggressors of Neighboring Democracies--aka S.T.A.N.D.--with Taiwan.\n  It is a simple bill but a very powerful one, especially in terms of \nits deterrent effect. It states that if the Chinese Communist Party \ninitiates a military invasion of Taiwan, the United States shall impose \na comprehensive suite of mandatory economic and financial sanctions. \nThe bill lays out these comprehensive sanctions, some of which are \nlisted here, in great detail. These sanctions would be crippling to the \nChinese Communist Party, its leaders, and key sectors of China's \neconomy.\n  The bill also calls on the United States to coordinate such \ncomprehensive sanctions with our allies around the globe, with the goal \nof making the CCP an economic pariah globally if President Xi chooses \nto militarily invade Taiwan.\n  The bill's goal is to make very clear to President Xi today the true \ncost of what such a military invasion of Taiwan would be, thereby \nheightening deterrence, which we all in the U.S. Senate support.\n  I believe the S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022 should receive broad \nbipartisan support. In many ways, it reinforces the goals, policies, \nand directives of the Taiwan Relations Act, which continues to have \noverwhelming support here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The defense of Taiwan is an issue that has been weaved in and out of \nthe careers and professions of countless Americans, including my own.\n  Over 25 years ago, in 1995 and 1996, I was a Marine infantry officer \ndeployed to the Taiwan Strait as part of a Marine amphibious task force \nand two U.S. carrier strike groups, all in response to the Chinese \nCommunist Party's aggressive military provocations on the eve of \nPresidential elections in Taiwan--the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, this \nperiod is now called. That was an important and decisive demonstration \nof American commitment and resolve to an emerging democracy and partner \nthat is still remembered today on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\n  More recently, I was part of another demonstration of American \ncommitment and resolve when I traveled to Taiwan with Democrat Senators \nTammy Duckworth and Chris Coons to provide vaccines--close to a \nmillion--from the United States for the Taiwanese people in the face of \nthe Chinese Communist Party's aggressive attempts to prevent the \ncitizens of Taiwan from receiving these lifesaving Western medicines.\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\n  I am now a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve, working again on \nthese issues in the INDOPACOM theater.\n  Let me conclude with this: American commitment and resolve for Taiwan \nhas been part of our law, heritage, trade, economics, and military \ndeployments for decades and should be for decades to come. The \nS.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022 is the next logical step to \ndemonstrate America's commitment to Taiwan, this time emphasizing the \ndeterrent power of our economic and financial strengths.\n  It is our values of freedom, innovation, the rule of law, individual \nrights, and openness that the Chinese Communist Party is most afraid \nof. We must be ready as democracies to defend these values or risk a \nworld increasingly governed by autocracy, surveillance, aggression, and \npermanent conflict. The S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act will help us do just \nthat.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Let's face it--it has been \na contentious week here in the U.S. Senate. We had a big vote last \nnight. I spoke about the issues we were debating last night and a few \ntimes on the Senate floor. Just a minute ago, I introduced a bill of \nmine on a very serious topic regarding a possible war with China and \nTaiwan. So it has been busy.\n  To be honest, my team and I were focused on a lot of these issues, \nand we were thinking about skipping my favorite part of the week--\ncoming down on the Senate floor and talking about the Alaskan of the \nweek--but then we came across a Twitter meme. You almost have to see it \nto completely understand it, but the gist of it was this: We in the \nSenate can't achieve civility without an ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech \nat the end of the week to lift spirits here in the Senate.\n  I kind of appreciated that meme, so we wanted to make sure that we, \nafter a rough, contentious couple of weeks, ended it on a note that was \nuplifting and to highlight another very special Alaskan, as I try to do \npretty much every week, whose role right now in our country is, in \nfact, going to be about bringing civility and respect and emphasizing \nthe importance of service to all people of the United States and across \nthe globe. So I thought, what a great time for an ``Alaskan of the \nWeek'' speech. I know the pages love it.\n  So let me introduce to you our Alaskan of the week this week: 20-\nyear-old Emma Broyles from Anchorage, who broke through barriers to \nbecome the first Alaskan and the first Korean American ever to be \ncrowned Miss America. This just happened a couple weeks ago. Emma is \nvery well-deserving, as you will see, and when it was announced that \nshe had won Miss America, when that happened, when her name was \nannounced, she cried tears of joy, of course, and Alaskans across the \nState cheered.\n  Now, every Miss America contestant picks a cause to champion. Special \nOlympics, which I love--I am probably Alaska's Special Olympics biggest \nfan--was Emma's cause.\n  The night of the event, they held a watch party at the Jim Balamici \nSpecial Olympics training center in Anchorage, which is a great \nfacility. Our Special Olympian athletes were the loudest of any group \nin the State cheering for Emma and her great win. Then, of course, \nthere is the huge, extended Korean-American family who was also \ncheering, laughing, and crying when it was announced that she had won.\n  After it was done, Emma told reporters: ``I didn't even expect to \nmake the top 10. I was there for the good time and the cheesecake.'' \nThat is Emma for you--funny, self-deprecating, humble, and real, just \nlike her home State. She is the perfect Miss America to represent the \ngreat State of Alaska.\n  So let me tell you about our Miss America, America's Miss America, \nAlaska's Miss America, and her goals going forward.\n  About 50 years ago, Emma's grandparents emigrated from Korea to \nAnchorage. They wanted to raise a family, to live the American dream. \nAlaska, of course, is a great place to do that.\n  By the way, we have the greatest, strongest, most incredible Korean-\nAmerican community in Alaska, who are just incredible Americans.\n  Emma's grandparents' daughter--Emma's mom--Julie was born in \nAnchorage, and so was her father Ron. Emma grew up a typical Alaskan \nkid--like my three daughters--fishing, winter sports, hard work at \nschool, community-oriented. Her mom was a special education teacher, \nand her older brother has Down syndrome.\n  Emma likes to say that she went to her first Special Olympics meet \nwhen she was in the womb, so she has been a fan literally from the \nbeginning of her life, and that is one of the reasons she is so \npassionate about that issue. She knows firsthand, like many of us do, \nthe power of Special Olympic athletes to inspire and to be such great \nrepresentatives for inclusion and respect and healthy competition.\n  Emma graduated from Service High School and made her way to Arizona \nState University, where she is now a junior studying biomedical \nsciences and voice performance. She wants to be a doctor. In fact, she \nwants to be a dermatologist.\n  Emma shared something with the world during the Miss America pageant \nthat was very brave, like so many young women are doing now, \nparticularly our athletes who have to perform and have a platform and \nuse that platform for good, to talk about some difficult issues. Emma \ntold the world that she had been diagnosed with ADHD--attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder--which led to chronic scratching and skin-\npinching issues.\n  Now, we don't hear a lot about that, but roughly 2 percent of the \npopulation has this challenge, mostly young women. That is why Emma \nwants to be a dermatologist--to help young women like her who suffer \nfrom this disorder or other medical challenges.\n  ``It was kind of a hard thing for me to share at first,'' Emma said, \nwith the world during the pageant. ``I wasn't sure if I was ready to be \nthat vulnerable, you know, on a national stage with hundreds [of] \nthousands of people watching.''\n  That is what she said, but she did it. She did it. That was very \ncourageous, and we are better for it.\n  With Emma's beautiful singing voice, her poise, her bravery in \nhighlighting an issue that has caused her a lot of pain, her role of \nchampioning the Special Olympics, her heritage, her home State, the \ncrown looked very natural and beautiful atop Emma's head, like it was \nmeant to be there.\n  Here is what she told a reporter after she won:\n\n       There were a lot of people who felt like they saw \n     themselves in me.\n\n  She talked about all of the positive messages she had received from \npeople all across America, Alaska, and the entire world after she won.\n  They told her how wonderful it was to see someone like them, someone \nwho had similar issues or someone who has a family member who has a \ndisability, and she talked about it courageously. They told her how \nwonderful it was ``seeing themselves in me and seeing this kind of \nrelatable figure and someone they can look to.'' That is Emma.\n  I think you are starting to see what a great young woman she is. Like \nso many of us, she had a tough time during COVID last year, but she \novercame it. She said, ``I hope that other people know that they can do \nthe same thing,'' overcoming these challenges, ``whatever it is they're \nstruggling with.''\n  So thank you, Emma, for being such an inspiration--incredible job, \nincredible courage, incredible poise.\n  I also--because I am talking about Emma--want to recognize so many \nother incredible Alaska women who have recently stepped up, done \namazing things.\n  We have a State of very strong women. I am lucky to be surrounded by \nthem everywhere--my wife, my daughters, cousins, sisters-in-law.\n  There is a famous saying in our State, and when you come to Alaska, \nyou see it everywhere--T-shirts, mugs, bumper stickers. It is a simple \nsaying: Alaska girls kick ass.\n  Now, look, I am not sure I am supposed to be able to say that on the \nSenate floor, but I just did. I hope I am not going to get fined or \nanything. But take a look. It is everywhere in our State. I love the \nbumper stickers.\n  And that, in the past year, has really proven to be true--truer than \never. We have our first Alaskan to win Miss America, our Alaskan of the \nWeek today, Emma Broyles. We had our first\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nAlaskan, Lydia Jacoby, to win a gold medal in swimming, where we don't \neven have an Olympic-size swimming pool. She won the breaststroke in an \namazing race. She did such a great job that she is the first person in \nU.S. Senate history to be Alaskan of the Week twice--not sure that is \never going to happen again.\n  We have the first Alaskan woman, Deniz Burnham, chosen to be a NASA \nastronaut. Another woman, Nichole Ayers, who was stationed at Elmendorf \nAir Force Base in Anchorage, was also picked to be an astronaut.\n  I don't know. It is something about breathing the air.\n  And, as usual, we have winter olympians going to the Winter Olympics \nagain this year, like we almost always do--strong, very strong, in that \narea: Rosie Brennan, Vicky Persinger.\n  And there is Quannah Chasinghorse, an Alaskan Native--a young Alaskan \nNative woman who was featured recently on the cover of Vogue.\n  So it has been a great year for strong Alaskan women. And to Emma, I \njust want to say: You make us all proud. Congratulations on your \nincredible win: Miss America, first Alaskan ever. You have been an \ninspiration to us. Thank you for your courage, your willingness to \nspeak out on tough issues and take up great causes like our Special \nOlympic athletes. And, of course, congratulations on being our Alaskan \nof the Week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, 10 minutes ago there was a different \nNevadan Senator sitting at the Presiding Officer's chair. Welcome.\n  I was at a roundtable this morning with a group of Ohio county \ncommissioners from conservative counties like Warren and Medina and \nmore progressive counties like Lucas and Hamilton--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike; male, female; a good cross section of Ohio leaders--\ntalking about the projects we are going to build and the good-paying \njobs we are going to create--jobs that will not be off-shored this time \nbecause we came together to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n  Yesterday, I was on a media call with the Republican mayor of \nFindlay, OH, about the I-75 bridge project that they need in Hancock \nCounty.\n  The day before, I was at another roundtable with western Ohio \nleaders, talking with them about how we can leverage these investments. \nIt is some of the most important work I am going to be doing over the \ncoming months, working with local and Federal officials to make sure \nthis investment translates into Ohio jobs.\n  The Presiding Officer understands this, that we pass legislation \nhere. With it, sometimes, comes a good bit of money, like with \ninfrastructure. But it is also up to us, as representing our States, to \nmake sure those dollars are spent efficiently and effectively and \nquickly, frankly.\n  The infrastructure bill is some of the most important work we have \ndone in the Senate in a long time. We are investing in our country.\n  For years, mayors and businesses and workers have been telling us, as \ntheir representatives, as their Senators, about the need to upgrade \ninfrastructure, but we have noticed over the years that candidates of \nboth parties have promised infrastructure. ``We are going to pass \nan infrastructure bill when I am elected,'' they say. Plenty talk about \nit, but now, with a new President and a new majority in the Senate and \nthe House, we are finally getting it done with this bipartisan \ninfrastructure bill.\n\n  Over the past few months, I have heard from communities about the \nprojects that this is going to allow them to accomplish.\n  In Toledo, with the mayor, talking about the city's plans to replace \nlead pipes--my State has the dubious distinction of being the second \nleading State, if you will. Our State has the second-most lead-\ncontaminated pipes from main water lines and the pipes going into \npeople's homes. We have 600,000 pipes like that going into people's \nhomes that have high levels of lead.\n  And science has known, paint companies have known, lead manufacturers \nhave known that infants, babies ingest lead. It affects their brain \ndevelopment for the rest of their lives. So one of our goals, working \nwith the mayor of Toledo, is over the next several years to replace \nthose pipes.\n  Ohio will get someone $1 billion in new funding to improve water \ninfrastructure.\n  The Western Hills Viaduct in Cincinnati, the Patterson Avenue Bridge \nin Dayton--Ohio has some 3,200 bridges eligible for upgrades. Some of \nthem, like the Brent Spence, unbelievably, across the Ohio River, \ncarries 3 percent of GDP every day across that river.\n  Some of those bridges are--when I grew up working the family farm, \ndriving a tractor with a hay wagon crossing little culvert bridges that \ndot our countryside and all over my State, many of those are in states \nof disrepair.\n  We have seen the new pollution-free buses that communities like Akron \nand Canton, Columbus, and Lake County are rolling out through Laketran, \ntheir transit system. We have heard about how they are going to expand \nservice so people can get to work and school.\n  We have some 60,000 buses--big city buses--and another 50 or 60,000 \nsmall transit, more rural buses, that need to be replaced. They are \nfossil fuel, mostly diesel engines, and we are going to replace those \nover the next several years with low-emission or zero-emission buses.\n  From the Port of Ashtabula, the community my wife grew up in, we are \nhearing about how upgrades to our ports will increase investment and \nhelp speed up and grow Ohio supply chains.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this Congress, this Senate and the \nHouse, frankly, over the years, at the behest of corporate lobbyists, \nsold us out on trade agreements, sold us out on tax policy, so that so \nmany jobs left our country. The industrial Midwest was hit the hardest, \nbut every State was hit by that job loss because of bad government \npolicy, again, lobbied by some of the largest corporations in the \nworld--the tech companies, the drug companies, the oil industry.\n  We now have a President who wants to get it right and bring those \nsupply chains closer to home.\n  Now this, we also see how Ohio needs better rail infrastructure--new \nrail cars for Cleveland RTA, better Amtrak service, safer rail \ncrossings.\n  But, fundamentally, this bill--the infrastructure bill--is a jobs \nbill. It will create construction jobs, to be sure. It will create \njobs--union jobs: carpenters, millwrights, electricians, plumbers and \npipe fitters, sheet metal workers, laborers. It will create those kinds \nof jobs but also create manufacturing jobs through the supply chain.\n  Senator Portman and I worked to make sure this bill has the strongest \n``Buy America'' requirements ever in an infrastructure bill with our \nBuild America, Buy America Act.\n  Every one of these projects will come with the strongest ever ``Buy \nAmerica'' rules. No more bridges--no more bay bridges in Northern \nCalifornia--made entirely with Chinese steel.\n  We introduced the ``Build America, Buy America'' bill on President \nTrump's inauguration day. Unfortunately, nothing moved because \neverything got crowded out of President Trump's agenda so they could \ngive a huge tax cut to the richest people in the country.\n  We worked with other leaders now, 4 years later, with a new \nPresident, to get it right.\n  With ``Buy America'' particularly, I call out Senator Baldwin from \nWisconsin, Senator Peters from Michigan and their work.\n  We are putting in place a clear, permanent standard: If American tax \ndollars are involved, American workers should be getting the jobs. It \nis going to mean more contracts for Ohio businesses.\n  Cleveland Cliffs' new plant in Toledo, talking about what we are \ndoing there, it is the cleanest steel making, I believe, in the entire \nworld at that new plant.\n  Owens Corning in Toledo; Gradall Industries in New Philadelphia, OH, \non the edge of Appalachia.\n  We have the potential for hundreds more bridge projects around the \nState using American rebar, American steel, American iron.\n  It is an investment in Ohio that will pay off, creating jobs now, \nboth during construction and up and down the supply chain. It will help \nattract new businesses. It will help keep the existing\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\nones. It will connect people with their jobs and businesses.\n  I will spend pretty much every day, and my staff will too, making \nsure that our State gets its fair share of this investment and these \njobs.\n  If you believe in the dignity of work, you fight for the people who \nmake this country work. We are seeing results.\n  On Wednesday, the mayor of Findlay and I were talking about the Biden \nadministration's announcement of $100 million in initial bridge funding \nalready on the way to Ohio. That focus will continue.\n  We are doing roundtables. We are doing briefings with Federal \nofficials, with local township trustees and county officials and mayors \nand city officials and State officials, talking about how they can \napply for Federal funding, and to make sure communities are best \npositioned to make the most of this infrastructure.\n  Our goal is to leverage this investment to create jobs in every city, \nin every county, in every township across my great State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, as our Nation battles another wave of \nCOVID-19, I want to detail my efforts to lower barriers for Americans \nto access lifesaving vaccinations against this terrible disease.\n  The Special Committee on Aging's investigation forced the largest \ncommercial health insurer in the United States to reverse course and \nmake whole providers who were paid far below the market rate for \nadministering COVID-19 vaccines. These efforts will help ensure that \nevery provider who can administer COVID-19 vaccines is doing so, \nhelping get more shots in arms.\n  Last year, news reports detailed how UnitedHealth had been \nshortchanging pediatricians who were vaccinating children against \nCOVID-19. In short, Medicare set reimbursement rates for participating \nproviders at $40 per dose in mid-March 2021. The Federal Government \nstrongly recommended that private carriers do the same and most appear \nto have done so within weeks, but UnitedHealth did not.\n  The committee's investigation found that UnitedHealth paid in-network \nproviders roughly 40 percent below the Medicare rate until July 1, \n2021. Further, the company delayed action to make providers whole. \nDuring the investigation, pediatricians in Pennsylvania and beyond \nraised concerns that UnitedHealth's original reimbursement rate could \ndissuade providers from administering the vaccine.\n  UnitedHealth covers 26 million people in employer and individual \nmarket health insurance plans, with 1.4 million\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nin-network providers and an estimated 14 percent market share. \nUnitedHealth's decision to reimburse providers below the Medicare rate \nhad the potential to harm families across our Nation at a critical \njuncture, just as the Food and Drug Administration prepared to expand \nthe availability of vaccines to children ages 5-11.\n  For parents with questions about vaccines, pediatricians are trusted \nadvisers who can play a key role in overcoming lingering concerns or \nhesitancy, which remains a major issue in our Nation.\n  In the long term, ensuring that all hands are on deck to deliver \nvaccines will help end this pandemic. Data has shown time and again \nthat being vaccinated against COVID-19 reduces infections, severe \ndisease, hospitalization, and death. Vaccinating children also will \nhelp protect adults by increasing the number of Americans shielded from \nthe virus, reducing its spread. It also reduces the chance for the \nvirus to mutate and spawn variants, like Omicron, that has led to \nanother wave of illness and death. These concerns are particularly \nimportant for older adults who are more likely than the general \npopulation to experience both severe COVID-19 and breakthrough \ninfections. Vaccinating children helps protect older generations, \nparticularly older adults living in multigenerational households, \nincluding more than 7 million grandparents who live with grandchildren \nunder the age of 18.\n  Providing more parents with the information they need to ensure they \nare comfortable vaccinating their kids will help protect all of our \nchildren. While pediatric hospitalizations remain relatively rare, \nthere has nonetheless been a significant increase of such \nhospitalizations as the Omicron variant has spread in recent weeks. The \nWall Street Journal recently reported that pediatric hospitalizations \ndue to COVID-19 reached pandemic highs in the United States.\n  Vaccinating more children is essential to keep schools open for in-\nperson learning, a live issue for schools throughout our Nation that \nhave been forced to return to online classes in the face of the Omicron \nvariant. We must do all that we can to safely keep students in the \nclassroom so that they can receive the high-quality education they \ndeserve. School closures also cause a disruption in the lives of \nfamilies, with parents often struggling to find childcare or forcing \nthem to take time from work. Vaccinating children will help schools \nremain open, protect students and educators, and help parents stay in \nthe workforce.\n  After Aging Committee investigators reached out to UnitedHealth, the \ncompany quickly and voluntarily committed to change course, commitments \nI detailed in an October 20, 2021, letter. In response to my letter, \nUnitedHealth confirmed its plans to retroactively increase \nreimbursements for approximately 2 million COVID-19 vaccine \nadministration claims to the Medicare rate across its entire commercial \nnetwork, including individual plans on the Affordable Care Act \nmarketplace. On January 14, 2022, the company reported that it had \nprocessed 1.64 million claims in connection with its commitment to the \ncommittee--more than 99.8 percent of the affected total--at an average \ncost of $14.55 per claim for a total of $23.9 million. The company \nexpects the remaining claims, which number less than 2,900, to be \nprocessed by February 1, 2022.\n  UnitedHealth also committed to more quickly update reimbursement \nrates for future emergent vaccines and therapeutics, whether for COVID-\n19 or the next pandemic. The company added that it is ``redirecting \nadditional internal resources and automating updates whenever \npossible,'' while noting that their new processes still might involve \nwithholding claims ``for a short time,'' which it characterized as no \nlonger than 30 days. On January 14, the company went further, stating \nthat it will implement new billing codes in a national public health \nemergency ``faster than industry standard,'' while noting that it has \n``learned over the past few months the required technology and human \nresources that need to be brought forward to accelerate'' adoption of \nnew billing codes in a public health emergency.\n  While lacking some details, the steps UnitedHealth has described \nappear to be an appropriate response. However, UnitedHealth has not \nadequately addressed an issue that a senior company official raised \nwhen speaking with Aging Committee investigators in September, that the \ncompany's size and numerous claims systems presented a barrier to \nquickly updating COVID-19 vaccine reimbursement rates in the first \nplace. In its responses to subsequent questions about the issue from \ncommittee staff, UnitedHealth has cited reasons such as contracting \nlanguage for the delay, but has failed to provide additional \ninformation or explanation in their written responses. The fact that a \nsenior UnitedHealth official told the committee that the company's size \nnegatively affected the quality and efficiency of its interactions with \nthe market is concerning and a matter that deserves continued oversight \nfrom Congress and regulators.\n  In recent weeks, the world has been upended by the Omicron variant. \nCase rates have skyrocketed, and hospitals are once again filling up, \nprimarily with people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine or \nbooster. In order to leave the tragedy, the disruptions and the \nclosures of the pandemic behind, every person who can be vaccinated has \na duty to the country to roll up their sleeves and get the shot.\n  We will continue to learn more about the Omicron variant and variants \nto come. However, there is one thing about this variant, past variants, \nand future variants that will not change: The key to ending this \npandemic is getting more people vaccinated.\n  I remain committed to removing future roadblocks that may emerge to \nwidespread vaccination against COVID-19.\n  This body should do the same.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nfollowing documents: a September 3, 2021 Modern Healthcare article \ndetailing UnitedHealth's under reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccines \ncompared to most other major carriers; my October 20, 2021 letter to \nUnitedHealth; UnitedHealth's November 5, 2021 response to my letter; a \nNovember 12, 2021 supplement to the company's original response; and a \nJanuary 14, 2022 email from UnitedHealth providing further updates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Modern Healthcare, Sept. 3, 2021]\n\n   UnitedHealthcare Pays Providers Below Standard Rates for COVID-19 \n                                Vaccines\n\n                            (By Nona Tepper)\n\n       Pediatricians across the country are claiming the nation's \n     largest insurer is shortchanging them for administering \n     COVID-19 vaccines, jeopardizing access to the main tool for \n     stopping the virus' spread.\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics has fielded complaints \n     from providers nationwide who are frustrated that \n     UnitedHealth Group is paying about 50% of the federal rate \n     for vaccine administration, said Dr. Sue Kressly, who chairs \n     the AAP's payment advocacy advisory committee and runs \n     Pennsylvania-based Kressly Pediatrics. While UnitedHealthcare \n     is not legally required to pay the federal rate, Kressly said \n     the Minnetonka, Minnesota-based insurer is the only national \n     carrier that has not agreed to pay at least $40 for vaccine \n     administration.\n       The insurer also continues to pay pediatricians and family \n     medicine providers below-market rates for COVID-19 tests, \n     Kressly said, an issue the New York Times revealed in \n     February.\n       With new variants of COVID-19 continuing to emerge, Kressly \n     worried that low fees for testing and vaccine administration \n     would lead some doctors to stop offering these services, \n     worsening the public health crisis, increasing medical costs \n     and inspiring more independent practices to shutter, \n     particularly as providers struggle with overwork during the \n     pandemic.\n       ``They had record-breaking profits in 2020, and we \n     struggled with getting them to pay adequately for COVID \n     testing. That still not been resolved,'' Kressly said. ``Now \n     pediatricians who are giving the vaccine to people covered by \n     UnitedHealthcare, they're effectively opening their wallet, \n     and subsidizing that patient to get the vaccine.''\n       At the end of the company's most recent second quarter on \n     June 30, UnitedHealthcare generated $55.5 billion in revenue, \n     up 13% from the $49.1 billion reported during the same period \n     last year. The company counted more than 49.6 million \n     enrollees, an increase of 1.2 million year-over-year. \n     Meanwhile, the insurer's low vaccine reimbursement rates \n     threaten the future of family practices, Kressly said. Unlike \n     most medical services, federal legislation bars providers \n     from balance billing patients for the COV[0-19 vaccine.\n       ``If we don't at least make enough money to cover our \n     costs, then we won't be here as practices to serve the \n     community beyond the\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\n     public health emergency,'' Kressly said. ``That's a bigger \n     problem.''\n       UnitedHealthcare is not the only payer offering clinicians \n     low fees for vaccine administration--some regional plans and \n     employers are also paying below the federal rate, Kressly \n     said. But she said these payers are likely just slow to react \n     to payment standards. In March, the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services nearly doubled what it was paying providers \n     for giving the vaccine, after the American Medical \n     Association found the previous rate did not cover the costs \n     associated with administering the shot. Most of these payers \n     are just confused about the update and, when Kressly reaches \n     out to them, she said they generally immediately increase \n     their rate. But UnitedHealthcare has refused to increase what \n     it is paying pediatricians.\n       ``They say, `Our fee schedule is our fee schedule, it's up \n     to the contract that the practice has with UnitedHealthcare, \n     let them try to have the conversation,' '' Kressly said.\n       UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it recently offered to \n     increase reimbursement for COVID-19 testing for some \n     pediatric and family medicine practices that met specific \n     criteria. When it comes to vaccines, UnitedHealthcare said it \n     is continually reviewing its reimbursement rates.\n       Dr. George Rogu, president of the Independent Pediatric \n     Collaborative of Long Island and head of RBK Pediatrics, \n     hopes to be one of the providers paid more for giving \n     UnitedHealthcare enrollees COVID-19 vaccines.\n       When Rogu reached out to the insurer last month. a \n     UnitedHealthcare customer service representative blamed his \n     low rates on his different customers' plans and the different \n     fee schedules associated with each. The customer service \n     representative said Rogu was the first provider to complain \n     about the matter and offered to refer his case to the \n     company's management team.\n       ``We cannot in good conscience say, `Oh, we can't give you \n     the vaccine because you have UnitedHealthcare.' That's not \n     right,'' Rogu said. ``It's just not humanely right. But \n     people that have a large panel of UnitedHealthcare customers? \n     It's killing them.''\n       Rogu said he is still waiting to hear back from the \n     insurer.\n       He said he noticed that he was being paid below the federal \n     rates in May and asked New York-based Canid Vaccines, his \n     vaccine administration software system, about the problem. \n     The startup verified that UnitedHealthcare reimbursed him at \n     about half the rate that other insurers did. Canid Vaccines \n     said it has identified at least 25 independent practices \n     representing more than 350 providers nationwide that \n     UnitedHealthcare is paying at less than the federal rate.\n       Among pediatric circles, UnitedHealthcare is often referred \n     to as the ``evil empire'' since they are the least \n     transparent and least cooperative among the major insurers, \n     said Dr. Peter Pogacar, vice president of the Rhode Island \n     chapter of the AAP and a pediatrician at East Greenwich \n     Pediatrics. He said UnitedHealthcare is underpaying \n     physicians for COVID-19 vaccine administration there too.\n       ``Healthcare should be about healing with business as a \n     sideshow, not the main event,'' Pogacar wrote in an email.\n       The insurer isn't just offering low rates for administering \n     the COVID-19 vaccine. UnitedHealthcare has also reimbursed \n     providers for less than what it cost them to purchase COVID-\n     19 testing kits. After significant media attention, the \n     manufacturer and distributor of the tests dropped their \n     prices so that providers were no longer losing money when \n     they were paid UnitedHealthcare rates, said Dr. Reshma \n     Chugani, a pediatrician at the Atlanta Children's Clinical \n     Center. The insurer also announced it would increase the rate \n     paid for the tests, as well as allow pediatricians to \n     resubmit patient claims, she said. But they are still not \n     offering to reimburse providers for tests previously paid at \n     below-market rates.\n       ``We lost money on every United patient,'' Chugani said.\n       Additionally, the insurer has made it difficult for \n     providers to recoup the money it said it owes them, forcing \n     them to go through multiple administrative layers and still \n     failing to reimburse one type of test at the full rate, said \n     AAP's Kressly. She said she talked to UnitedHealthcare about \n     this issue two weeks ago and that it has still not been \n     resolved.\n       ``They've put barriers for us to have to act when we have \n     no time, energy or resources to do so,'' she said.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 20, 2021.\n     Sir Andrew Witty,\n     Chief Executive Officer,\n     UnitedHealth Group.\n       Dear Sir Andrew: I write in regard to commitments \n     UnitedHealth Group (UnitedHealth) made to the U.S. Senate \n     Special Committee on Aging related to reimbursement policies \n     for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. UnitedHealth's \n     past policies appeared to have created access barriers for \n     children seeking COVID-19 vaccination from their primary care \n     pediatrician--barriers that affected younger and older \n     Americans alike. I appreciate the company's decision to \n     reprocess certain COVID-19 vaccine claims, which I expect \n     will facilitate the broadest possible access to COVID-19 \n     vaccines among UnitedHealth's members. I expect that the \n     steps UnitedHealth has committed to take will help children \n     seeking COVID-19 vaccines as well as older Americans under \n     the purview of the Aging Committee, including the millions \n     who live with and care for their grandchildren or other \n     younger relatives. I appreciate your company's assurance that \n     UnitedHealth will keep the Aging Committee updated on its \n     progress toward expeditiously resolving the concerns raised \n     with the company.\n       The Aging Committee's attention was drawn to this issue by \n     press reports highlighting that during a four-month period \n     earlier this year, UnitedHealth reimbursed pediatricians at \n     rates that failed to meet the costs of administering COVID-19 \n     vaccines. During that time, other large insurers reportedly \n     reimbursed pediatricians and other health care providers at a \n     higher rate, in line with what the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) set in March 2021. Pediatricians \n     raised concerns that UnitedHealth's low reimbursement rates \n     would deter in-network providers from administering COVID-19 \n     vaccines, creating barriers for patients. The additional \n     costs of administering COVID-19 vaccines have been \n     significant for providers, a point that CMS noted at the time \n     it increased reimbursement rates, citing ``updated \n     information about the costs involved in administering the \n     COVID-19 vaccine for different types of providers and \n     suppliers and the additional resources you need to safely and \n     appropriately administer the vaccine.'' The agency \n     furthermore encouraged private payers to follow suit, noting \n     that ``in light of CMS's increased Medicare payment rates, \n     CMS will expect commercial carriers to continue to ensure \n     that their rates are reasonable in comparison to prevailing \n     market rates.'' Given UnitedHealth's status as the Nation's \n     largest commercial payer--with 26 million people enrolled in \n     employer and individual plans, 1.4 million in-network \n     providers and an estimated 14 percent market share--it is \n     critical that the company do all it can to ensure that \n     vaccines are available to every person that is eligible to \n     receive one. To that end, the Aging Committee requested that \n     UnitedHealth provide information about the company's \n     reimbursement rates, the timeliness of future fee schedule \n     updates and the company's progress toward making providers \n     whole for vaccines they administered while UnitedHealth was \n     reimbursing below reimbursement rates set by CMS.\n       The ongoing effort to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates \n     across our Nation demands an all-hands-on-deck approach. \n     Ensuring that all eligible children are vaccinated against \n     COVID-19 is key to improving the overall vaccination rate, \n     which will better protect older Americans by helping stem the \n     spread of the virus. Such efforts are of particular \n     importance ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) \n     expected consideration of COVID-19 vaccines for young \n     children later this month. Older Americans have been among \n     those hit hardest by COVID-19 and face the greatest health \n     risks if they contract the disease, even after being \n     vaccinated. Recognizing the elevated risk of breakthrough \n     infections in older adults, the Biden administration recently \n     authorized third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for \n     people ages 65 and over. The serious health risks COVID-19 \n     poses for older adults are especially acute for those living \n     in multi-generation households, including more than 7 million \n     grandparents who live with grandchildren under the age of 18. \n     Those older Americans are at even greater risk of exposure \n     when they live with unvaccinated individuals, an important \n     consideration given the greater impact of the delta variant \n     on children. The current wave of COVID-19 has led to higher \n     pediatric case rates, record pediatric hospitalizations and \n     school closures that have affected more than 900,000 students \n     at 1,800 schools across 44 states in August and September \n     alone.\n       During calls in September with Aging Committee staff, \n     UnitedHealth officials confirmed press accounts that reported \n     a months-long period when the company was reimbursing \n     providers up to 40 percent less for COVID-19 vaccine \n     administration than the rate set by the CMS. While other \n     major payers reportedly adopted the reimbursement rate set by \n     CMS swiftly, UnitedHealth continued reimbursing at a lower \n     rate until the end of June. During conversations with staff, \n     UnitedHealth reported that it had problems uploading the CMS \n     rate to the company's various fee schedules. Aging Committee \n     staff have heard concerns from providers that the \n     reimbursement issues pediatricians experienced with \n     UnitedHealth earlier this year could resurface when the FDA \n     authorizes a COVID-19 vaccine for 5-11 year-olds, which will \n     carry a different billing code.\n       Following the concerns raised by the Aging Committee last \n     month, UnitedHealth informed Aging Committee staff during a \n     call on October 6 that the company planned to address the \n     concerns outlined above. Specifically, UnitedHealth committed \n     to reprocessing all of its commercial claims--not just \n     pediatric claims--from the time CMS issued new rates for \n     COVID-19 vaccines in mid-March to the time United updated its \n     fee schedule on July 1. Company officials further stated that \n     United Health would reprocess the claims automatically and \n     that providers would not be required to resubmit claims for \n     reprocessing. Noting that the company expected to reprocess \n     ``millions'' of claims that\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\n     were submitted by providers during the three-and-a-half month \n     period prior to July 1, UnitedHealth officials told Aging \n     Committee staff that they hoped to make ``significant \n     progress'' within 30-45 days. Company officials further \n     committed to:\n       1. Review UnitedHealth's claims process to minimize delays \n     in making payments to providers for COVID-19 vaccines;\n       2. Verify that there are no similar underpayment issues in \n     its Affordable Care Act Exchange and Medicaid Managed Care \n     books of business: and\n       3. Provide updates to Aging Committee staff on the \n     company's progress toward meeting these goals.\n       As part of these updates, please also provide me with the \n     following information no later than November 5, 2021:\n       1. How many claims does UnitedHealth expect to reprocess \n     for COVID-19 vaccinations that were administered prior to \n     July 1, 2021? What was the average difference between the \n     initial reimbursement and the reprocessed claim? What was the \n     total amount that UnitedHealth paid to providers to settle \n     these claims at the CMS rates?\n       2. UnitedHealth told Aging Committee staff that it is \n     difficult to quickly update its reimbursement rates when new \n     vaccine billing codes and rates are issued by CMS. \n     UnitedHealth further stated that its expected solution for \n     this issue may involve delaying payments to providers to give \n     the company's payment systems time to reflect new codes and \n     rates. In order to minimize access delays in the future, what \n     steps is UnitedHealth taking to ensure that pediatricians and \n     other providers will be reimbursed in a timely manner when \n     CMS issues new rates for COVID-19 vaccines or other emergent \n     vaccines and therapeutics in the future?\n       Thank you for your attention to this important issue. If \n     you or your staff has questions, please contact Peter \n     Gartrell, Chief Investigator for Chairman Casey.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 5, 2021.\n     Chairman Bob Casey,\n     U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Casey: On behalf of UnitedHealth Group, \n     including our over 120,000 frontline doctors, nurses, and \n     other health care practitioners, thank you for your recent \n     letter regarding retroactive payment for COVID-19 vaccine \n     administration. Like many individuals and families, \n     clinicians and essential health workers have sacrificed \n     deeply these past two years as our country worked together to \n     fight COVID-19.\n       We share your commitment to ensuring and expanding access \n     to critically important health care services and understand \n     these are extraordinarily challenging times for the millions \n     of people we are privileged to serve, as well as employers, \n     health care providers, governments, and the health care \n     system. We welcome this opportunity to provide you with an \n     overview of the significant actions we have voluntarily taken \n     regarding vaccine reimbursement and the steps we are taking \n     to quickly address the concerns expressed.\n       UnitedHealth Group is committed to helping people live \n     healthier lives and making the health care system work better \n     for everyone. We do this by working with stakeholders and \n     partners to address the biggest challenges facing our system. \n     As we shared during our conversation, we have been in close \n     contact with the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding \n     concerns they raised about vaccine reimbursement.\n       Consistent with the discussion with your staff on October \n     6th and your October 21st letter, we are writing to confirm \n     the following details related to our reimbursement for COVID-\n     19 vaccine administration:\n       UnitedHealthcare (UHC) has been reimbursing providers using \n     the new CMS rates since July 1, 2021, consistent with timing \n     specified in UHC's contracts with providers.\n       UHC will adjust claims paid less than $40 between March 15 \n     and June 30, 2021 to reimburse at $40 per administration, so \n     providers can benefit from the increase CMS announced on \n     March 15, 2021.\n       The voluntary retroactive reimbursement changes are in \n     process and claims will be adjusted accordingly. Providers \n     will not need to take action to receive the change in \n     reimbursement.\n       UnitedHealth Group recognizes the important role that \n     reimbursement plays in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, \n     which is why we are taking action to adjust previous claims \n     and accelerating our processes to update reimbursement rates \n     when changes are announced by CMS. In your letter dated \n     October 21, 2021, you asked for the following information:\n       The number of COVID-19 vaccine administration claims UHC \n     expects to reprocess.\n       The average difference between the initial reimbursement \n     and the reprocessed claim.\n       The total amount that will be reimbursed.\n       Information on how we will ensure providers will be \n     reimbursed in a timely manner when CMS issues new rates for \n     COVID-19 vaccine claims going forward.\n       Approximately two million COVID-19 vaccine administration \n     claims paid between March 15 and June 30, 2021 will be \n     impacted by this retroactive adjustment. We anticipate the \n     average adjustment will be approximately $12.50 per claim, \n     for total additional reimbursement of approximately $25 \n     million. UHC has already begun processing these \n     reimbursements.\n       With regard to new rates for COVID-19 vaccinations or other \n     emergent therapeutics for COVID-19, we will be accelerating \n     our process for updating our reimbursement to support the \n     COVID-19 vaccine codes and rates implemented by CMS as they \n     become available. Specifically, UHC will implement new COVID-\n     19 codes and rates upon the publication of this information \n     by CMS rather than including these changes in our scheduled \n     quarterly reimbursement update processes. This will ensure \n     provider payments are updated as quickly as possible.\n       We appreciate the services provided by health care \n     professionals during the pandemic. The actions we are taking \n     to adjust COVID-19 vaccine claims build on the many steps we \n     have taken to support providers over the last eighteen \n     months, including accelerating claims payments, assisting in \n     processing and administering CARES Act Federal funding to \n     providers, working with HHS to ensure clinicians who provided \n     COVID-19 testing or treatment for individuals without \n     insurance were reimbursed for their services, and removing \n     administrative requirements in highly impacted areas.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to address the Committee's \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian Thompson,\n     CEO, UnitedHealthcare.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 12. 2021.\n     Addendum to UHG--Senate Aging Committee Response on 11/5/21\n\n       Thank you for the email of November 8, 2021 with follow-up \n     questions to UHG's letter dated 11/5/2021, and for your \n     continued engagement regarding how we reimburse providers for \n     COVID-19 vaccine administration. Please see our additional \n     responses below:\n       Staff asked that we clarify whether ``similar underpayment \n     issues occurred in United's Affordable Care Act and Medicaid \n     Managed Care plans.''\n       Answer: As discussed with staff, we have been paying \n     providers according to their contracts since the vaccines \n     first became available. These provider contracts explicitly \n     provide how new procedure codes are implemented and on what \n     timeline; those provisions are agreed to by all parties. \n     Because United paid its network providers according to these \n     contracts, there have been no ``underpayments.'' \n     Nevertheless, after reviewing concerns about the contracted \n     reimbursement amounts paid earlier this year, we elected to \n     voluntarily increase reimbursement--above and beyond \n     contractual rates--for all commercial plans (including \n     individual plans purchased via ACA exchanges), for dates of \n     service between March 15, 2021 and June 30, 2021.\n       Within ACA Exchanges, we similarly have paid according to \n     contracts agreed to with providers. ACA Exchange plans will \n     be included in the voluntary increase in reimbursement \n     described above. The completion of that increase will be on \n     the same time frame as commercial plans. With respect to \n     managed Medicaid, as we noted in our first discussion with \n     staff on September 22, 2021, those plans pay according to \n     rates set by state law and state payment policies. United has \n     paid for vaccine administration consistent with those \n     parameters and will continue to do so.\n       Staff asked that we provide detail about how we will timely \n     reimburse providers for emergent vaccines and therapeutics \n     unrelated to COVID-19 and the current Public Health Emergency \n     (PHE).\n       Answer: In the event of a future pandemic or new PHE we \n     will take immediate actions (noted below) to accelerate \n     reimbursement updates. Outside of a pandemic or PHE how we \n     update codes and payment rates will continue to be guided by \n     our existing contracts with providers. Consistent with \n     industry practice, those contracts provide for timely and \n     substantial payment to providers while we complete the update \n     to our systems. At all times we will follow all applicable \n     state and federal requirements.\n       Staff noted the complexity of adjusting reimbursement rates \n     for new procedure codes and asked for details on how United \n     might make those adjustments more quickly in the future.\n       Answer: We hope that under less exigent circumstances CMS \n     will provide additional lead time for its pronouncements, but \n     United is not relying on that to speed its processes during \n     this PHE. Instead, we are devoting significant time and \n     effort to ensuring that the process of updating new COVID-19-\n     related codes within our systems begins at the time of \n     publication of those codes and without regard to contractual \n     timelines. This includes, for example, redirecting additional \n     internal resources and automating updates whenever possible. \n     While some claims filed immediately after new payment codes \n     are announced might be held for a short time while those \n     updates are being made (generally no longer than 30 days \n     after receipt), we believe this will result in overall faster \n     reimbursement at updated rates. Indeed, it is common in the \n     industry to hold claims during a period of change or \n     uncertainty to help ensure that those claims are paid \n     accurately. We are confident we will be able to update new \n     codes for all claims platforms on a timely basis.\n       Finally, staff asked for updates as to our progress on \n     increasing the reimbursement amount for the approximately two \n     million claims impacted by our decision to voluntarily \n     increase reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine administration.\n       Answer: To date, we have resolved approximately 60% of \n     these claims. We expect the\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\n     remaining claims to be completed in the coming 6-8 weeks. We \n     will update you when all claims are complete.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Prible, John M.\n     To: Gartrell, Peter (Aging)\n     Cc: Hartman, Doug (Aging); Shakow, Peter\n     Subject: RE: Follow Up on UnitedHealthcare's Response\n     Date: Friday, January 14, 2022 5:12:29 PM\n\n       Peter, thank you for your recent email, in which you asked \n     for an update on our voluntary efforts to retroactively \n     increase reimbursement to $40 for COVID-19 vaccine \n     administration. Answers to your questions are provided below; \n     however, we expect that this confidential information will \n     not be shared with third parties.\n       To date, we have retroactively reimbursed providers for \n     1,640,996 claims, or more than 99.8% of all affected claims. \n     The average additional payment for those claims was $14.55, \n     for a total of approximately $23.9 million in additional \n     payments. At this time, fewer than 2,900 claims (less than \n     0.2% percent of all affected claims) remain to be \n     reprocessed. Because the original paid amount on those \n     remaining claims averaged about $36, the average additional \n     reimbursement to be paid will be about $4. Those remaining \n     reimbursements continue to be prioritized and sent out the \n     door. We anticipate those few remaining claims will be \n     completed by February 1, 2022.\n       We note that you asked for claims and payment data by \n     state. There are a few reasons we are not able to cut this \n     data cleanly by state, including that providers submit claims \n     via tax identification numbers (TIN), many of which cover \n     physicians (and therefore claims) from multiple states.\n       You also asked for additional information about how we will \n     shorten the adoption time of new rates in this or a future \n     national public health emergency (NPHE). As we stated \n     previously, contracts between United and its network provider \n     groups specifically provide for time to implement new rates \n     in an orderly way. We understand this to be routine across \n     the industry, understood and long accepted by the provider \n     community, and entirely proper. If there is another NPHE or \n     there are exceptional circumstances which dictate more timely \n     adoption of new rates, we have learned over the past few \n     months the required technology and human resources that need \n     to be brought forward to accelerate. As a point of reference, \n     should circumstances justify it, we commit to implement new \n     codes in an NPHE faster than industry standard.\n                                                      John Prible,\n                                 Vice President, External Affairs,\n     UnitedHealth Group.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I often hear from people in Wyoming who \nare concerned about the changes being proposed in Washington, DC. When \nthe Federal Government changes the rules, authorities, or standards, it \ncan significantly impact critical Wyoming industries.\n  In the ``Wyoming Livestock Roundup,'' a weekly news source for \nWyoming's ranchers, farmers, and Agribusiness community, Sarah L. Falen \nauthored an opinion editorial titled ``The Government's Word: Should We \nTrust It.''\n  She raises concerns about the Biden administration's rule revoking \nthe Trump administration policy prohibiting prosecution for \naccidentally harming migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty \nAct. While there has been a lot of discussion about the impact on the \nenergy industries, Sarah Falen points out how the new rule could affect \nthe agriculture industry. It is important that Congress note these \nconsequences and the uncertainty created by the Biden administration's \nrule.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe opinion editorial written by Sarah L. Falen.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Government's Word: Should We Trust It?\n\n                          (By Sarah L. Fallen)\n\n       Americans trust the U.S. government less and less. In fact, \n     according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in the \n     federal government hovers around 40%. Yet, with the \n     revocation of the Trump Administration's rule that prohibits \n     prosecution for accidentally harming migratory birds under \n     the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Biden \n     Administration is asking citizens to do just that, ``trust'' \n     the federal government.\n       People involved in industries such as energy or agriculture \n     have a clear understanding of how environmental legislation, \n     originally passed with the best intention, has been \n     weaponized to negatively affect their livelihoods. One of the \n     lesser known, but just as dangerous environmental swords is \n     the MBTA. While it is easy to see that energy industries, \n     such as oil and gas, wind or even solar would be impacted by \n     the Biden decision, this Act has the potential for very \n     serious impacts on the agriculture industry.\n       The MBTA is a statute that allows for the criminal \n     prosecution of any person who ``incidentally takes'' a \n     migratory bird. To understand the breath of this Act, there \n     are two important concepts. First, nearly all birds in the \n     U.S. are considered migratory. Second, what constitutes an \n     ``incidental take.'' The MBTA states that ``it [is] unlawful \n     at any time, . . . to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, . . \n     . any migratory bird . . .'' 16 U.S.C. 703(a). If you read \n     that language, it would make sense that this Act is referring \n     to someone who intends to kill a migratory bird. That \n     commonsense reading is what the Trump MBTA rule enforced . . \n     . only those engaged in an action that purposefully ``takes'' \n     a migratory bird would be subject to fines and prison time. \n     This is not how the Biden Administration reads that language.\n       According to the Biden Administration, even if a person is \n     doing something that accidentally harms a migratory bird, \n     that person can still be criminally liable. Thus, someone can \n     be prosecuted for an action or inaction that is otherwise \n     legal, but just so happens to ``take'' a migratory bird.\n       We should all be concerned about the Biden Administration \n     allowing ``incidental take'' to be prosecuted because there \n     is no limit on what can be prosecuted. This means that if a \n     farmer uses a pesticide that is legally administered and a \n     migratory bird just so happens to ingest that pesticide, he \n     could be subject to criminal prosecution. The MBTA allows for \n     up to a $5,000 fine or six months in prison for an incidental \n     take.\n       The scenarios under which a person can accidentally kill a \n     migratory bird are infinite and can be ridiculous. Yet, the \n     government expects us to believe that they will only \n     prosecute ``foreseeable'' accidental killings of migratory \n     birds. It is foreseeable that a bird can ingest a legally \n     administered pesticide. Are farmers now risking prison time \n     for growing the food that feeds America and the world?\n       The Biden Administration has entertained the idea of an \n     ``incidental take permit'' that might remove some of the \n     liability for birds that are accidentally killed, however \n     they have not developed the idea enough to know what the \n     permit would look like. There aren't any standards for what \n     actions would be exempt from liability under the permit \n     system and the MBTA office doesn't have enough staff to begin \n     handling the undoubtedly thousands of permit applications \n     they will receive.\n       The government has often implemented rules, promising it \n     will not take advantage of its authority, but time after time \n     this has proven to be just a way to get a rule approved or \n     legislation passed. From wolves and grizzly bears to ever \n     changing definitions of ``navigable waters,'' the government \n     has proven that its word should not be trusted and the MBTA \n     is no exception.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, on Monday, our Nation celebrated the \nlife and legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Like many Americans, it \nwas a day of self-reflection for me. While leading a bipartisan \ndelegation to Ukraine, I had a front-row seat to a nation struggling to \nhold on to its democracy in the face of a potential outside attack. \nThis comes at a very poignant moment in America's history when we were \nreminded of the strength and fragility of our own democracy.\n  One year ago, a violent mob fueled by false claims of widespread \nelection fraud stormed the U.S. Capitol. This was the most significant \nassault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. Although State and \nFederal judges ruled against efforts to overturn the results of the \nelection, this lie of election fraud has continued to propagate. And \nnow, those who didn't like the 2020 election results are trying to \nrewrite the rules.\n  Since the 2020 elections, Republican State lawmakers have passed an \nunprecedented number of bills to erode the authority of state and local \nelection officials. These new laws would strip secretaries of state of \ntheir authority, allow partisan ballot reviews, and even make local \nelection officials criminally or financially liable for technical \nerrors and actions, such as proactively sending out absentee ballot \napplications.\n  In total, 19 States have passed regressive laws that make it harder \nto vote and, in some extreme cases, may even allow Republican-\ncontrolled legislatures to overturn the results of a legitimate \nelection by using false claims of voter fraud. In New Hampshire, over \nthe past year, we have seen efforts to eliminate same-day voter \nregistration, a measure that would disproportionately impact young \nvoters, including college students and first-time voters.\n  Similarly, other efforts to prohibit students attending college in \nNew Hampshire from voting in our State's elections would unduly \nburden--if not outright disenfranchise--many of those young voters. \nOther attempts to make voter registration more complicated have failed \nin court, including requirements for additional documentation for same-\nday registrants, and restrictions on which types of addresses are valid \nfor registration.\n  These efforts are ongoing, with additional restrictive and burdensome \nmeasures being introduced as recently as the current legislative \nsession. And it is not just our voter laws. Earlier this month, the \nRepublican-controlled New Hampshire House approved a redistricting plan \nthat can only be described as gerrymandering. Taken together, these \nmeasures represent a comprehensive and coordinated attempt to burden--\nor even deprive--certain Granite State citizens of their right to vote. \nSuch blatant efforts to suppress the vote must not be tolerated.\n  The right to vote is one of the most fundamental and cherished \nprinciples of our democracy. The history of our Republic is marked by \nthose seminal moments when we as a nation extended the right to cast a \nballot to broader populations, thereby including more voices in our \nrepresentative government: first after the Civil War with the 15th \nAmendment, then to women with the 19th Amendment, and then notably with \nthe 1965 Voting Rights Act. As others have noted, the Voting Rights Act \nhas historically drawn great bipartisan support for its reauthorization \nbecause the principles embodied in it go to the very heart of our \ndemocracy.\n  But the issues and challenges that are increasingly facing our voters \nare very real and very troubling--and we must take them seriously or \nrisk eroding that most fundamental of rights. Making voter registration \nmore difficult or making the process of voting more burdensome has \ndisproportionate effects on some of the most vulnerable voters--whether \nthose be young voters, communities of color, the poor, the homeless, \namong others. Eliminating or limiting opportunities for early voting, \nsame-day registration, voting by mail, automatic registration, or the \nuse of absentee ballots are all different pathways to the same \npernicious effect--the suppression of the vote.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Freedom to Vote Act and the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Together, these bills would \nstandardize voting election laws across the country, expand voting \naccess and restore key provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that \nhave been struck down or weakened by the Supreme Court.\n  The right to vote isn't determined by political affiliation. It is \nthe most sacred right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for every \neligible American and ensures that our country is, as President Lincoln \nsaid, ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.''\n  I am deeply disappointed by the inability--or unwillingness--of this \naugust body to come together today to take this basic step in defense \nof our democracy. We, the U.S. Senate, ought to be the foremost \nchampions and defenders of democracy, but today, I fear that we have \nallowed partisan considerations to distract us from that duty.\n  We cannot afford to stay silent and ignore these measures that \nattempt to undo the progress that we have made over decades. We \nespecially cannot stay silent when all of us here witnessed the \nhorrific events of January 2021 and the attempt to undo a legitimate \nelection. Protecting voting rights for every American is the first and \nirreplaceable step towards protecting our democracy. We must take it \nseriously, we must not let it wither in the dark, and we must not stay \nsilent. It is far too important--and once damaged, it is far too hard \nto rebuild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I \nrecognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the \nAmerican entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to \nrecognize the small business, Powell Valley Millwork of Clay City, KY, \nas the Senate Small Business of the Week.\n  Twenty-seven years ago Jim Thornberry and his son Jimmy left the \nmining industry behind in search of a new venture. Shortly thereafter, \nPowell Valley Millwork was founded. The Thornberry's started their mill \nwith the desire to harvest a tangible product within a sustainable \nindustry, and that mission has stayed at the heart of their business \nthroughout their decades of growth and success.\n  The talent and substance of Powell Valley Millwork draws directly \nfrom our State, with the mill focusing on only one species of lumber: \npoplar. As\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nthe State tree of Kentucky, poplar is an abundant resource within \nAppalachia, which makes their location in rural Clay City a prime spot \nfor their operation. Often referred to as ``the painter's wood,'' \npoplar is known for its clear grain, smooth milling, and paint-taking \nqualities. The versatile and fine nature of the wood allows Powell \nValley Millwork to supply consumers with a wide variety of interior-\ntrim products, such as stretcher bars, door and window jambs, stair \nparts, cabinetry components, primed finger-joint interior trim, and \nmore. In creating all these products, the Powell Valley millworkers \nmake sure nothing goes to waste. Poplar can be safely used as animal \nbedding which means the mill's offcuts, those that are not already \nbeing used to fuel the company's wood drying kilns, are turned into \nshavings. These shavings are then bagged and shipped out by the truck \nload to be sold in a wide variety of retail outlets.\n  This Powell County mill maintains their technology at a topnotch \nstandard. In 2019 the owners invested in a new addition to the team: a \nsophisticated scanning rough mill line from Eagle Machinery & Supply, \nInc. The new rough mill line is able to process 65,000 board feet of \nlumber in a single 8-hour shift with only six people required to \noperate it. The joint project between Powell and Eagle, both family \ncompanies, demonstrates that U.S. machinery manufacturers can \nsuccessfully compete with Europeans in providing world-class technology \nto the North American wood processing industry.\n  The Thornberrys keep their eye on efficiency and progress, opening up \nownership of the company to experts outside the family, including Brian \nLambert, Powell Valley Mill's General manager, and Dale Budke, the \nmill's operations manager. As fellow owners of the company, these \ngentleman provide the expertise necessary for navigating the growing \nKentucky lumber industry. In 2019 Powell Valley Millwork acquired the \nMetrie Poplar manufacturing facility in nearby Jeffersonville, KY. With \na new 125,000-square-foot location only 12 miles from their original \nfacility, the two locations utilize their natural synergies to support \nthe needs of a diverse customer base across North America in full truck \nand railroad quantities.\n  Powell Valley Millwork is a testament to the ingenuity and \nresourcefulness of Kentuckians. Drawing from our beautiful natural \nresources and employing over 200 local men and women, this business \nillustrates some of the best qualities Kentucky has to offer--fine \ncraftsmanship and dedicated hard work. Powell Valley Millwork is a \ndecades-old dream the Thornberrys had when they left the mining \nindustry, a dream that has grown beyond what they had imagined. Small \nbusinesses like Powell Valley are the core of small towns across \nKentucky, and like the poplars they use in their mill, their roots grow \ndeep to help our communities flourish. Congratulations to the \nThornberrys and the entire Powell Valley team. I wish them the best of \nluck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in \nKentucky.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, devotion, commitment, \nresilience--these are just a few of the words that describe the \nprofessionals who comprise Maryland's 24 local boards of education.\n  The dedicated public servants who lead the school systems in Maryland \ncounties and Baltimore City act with deep commitment to their \ncommunities and their time-intensive school board duties. Maryland \nschool board members make critical budget and planning decisions, adopt \npolicies to create supportive learning environments for all students, \nengage with parents, students, school staff, and other community \nstakeholders, work closely with superintendents, respond to crises, and \nundergo ongoing training to carry out effective governance, continue to \ngrow as leaders, and stay up-to-date on the latest best practices.\n  As devoted professionals who serve students, school systems, and \ntheir communities at large, Maryland school board members face an array \nof daunting challenges every day, challenges made significantly more \ndifficult and complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet Maryland's 24 \nschool boards have consistently risen to these challenges, working to \nensure excellence in public education throughout the State.\n  School board members come from all backgrounds and professions. They \nmay not agree on every issue, but they unite and volunteer to serve \nunder the strong conviction that Maryland students come first.\n  Because of the extraordinary, continuing commitment of those who \nserve on our school boards to helping Maryland students grow, thrive, \nand excel each day--and with my ongoing commitment to Maryland public \neducation in mind--I am proud to recognize January as Maryland School \nBoard Recognition Month.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Res. 498\n\n       Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise \n     awareness of and celebrate the powerful impact of mentoring \n     relationships, recruit new mentors, and encourage \n     institutions to integrate quality mentoring into their \n     policies, practices, and programs;\n       Whereas quality mentoring fosters positive life and social \n     skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achievement \n     and college access, supports career exploration, and nurtures \n     youth leadership development;\n       Whereas mentoring happens in many settings, including \n     community-based programs, elementary and secondary schools, \n     institutions of higher education, government agencies, \n     religious institutions, and the workplace, and in various \n     ways, including formal mentoring matches and informal \n     relationships with teachers, coaches, neighbors, faith \n     leaders, and others;\n       Whereas effective mentoring of underserved and vulnerable \n     populations helps individuals confront challenges and enjoy \n     improved mental health and social-emotional well-being;\n       Whereas studies have shown that incorporating culture and \n     heritage into mentoring programs can improve academic \n     outcomes and increase community engagement, especially for \n     Alaska Native and American Indian youth;\n       Whereas youth development experts agree that mentoring \n     encourages positive youth development and smart daily \n     behaviors, such as finishing homework and having healthy \n     social interactions, and has a positive impact on the growth \n     and success of a young person;\n       Whereas mentors help young people set career goals and can \n     help connect mentees to industry professionals to train for \n     and find jobs;\n       Whereas mentoring programs generally have a significant, \n     positive impact on youth academic achievement, school \n     connectedness and engagement, and educational success, which \n     leads to outcomes such as improved attendance, grades and \n     test scores, and classroom behavior;\n       Whereas research has found that young people facing a risk \n     of not completing high school but who had a mentor were, \n     compared with their peers, more likely to enroll in college, \n     to participate regularly in sports or extracurricular \n     activities, to hold a leadership position in a club or sports \n     team, and to volunteer regularly, and less likely to start \n     using drugs;\n       Whereas mentoring has long been a staple of juvenile \n     justice and violence prevention efforts, and can offer \n     comprehensive support to youth at risk for committing \n     violence or victimization, as mentoring can address many risk \n     factors at once;\n       Whereas mentoring relationships for youth facing risk, such \n     as foster youth, can have a positive impact on a wide range \n     of factors, including mental health, educational functioning \n     and attainment, peer relationships, employment, and housing \n     stability;\n       Whereas mentoring programs have been found to positively \n     impact many aspects of mental well-being, including reducing \n     unhealthy coping mechanisms, improving interpersonal \n     relationships, and reducing parental stress;\n       Whereas mentoring is an innovative, evidence-based practice \n     and, uniquely, is both a prevention and intervention strategy \n     that can support young people of all demographics and \n     backgrounds in all aspects of their lives;\n       Whereas each of the benefits of mentors described in this \n     preamble serves to link youth to economic and social \n     opportunity while also strengthening communities in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas despite the benefits of mentoring, one young person \n     of every three is growing up without a mentor, which means a \n     third of the young people of the United States are growing up \n     without someone outside of the home to offer real life \n     guidance and support; and\n       Whereas this ``mentoring gap'' demonstrates the need for \n     collaboration among the private, public, and nonprofit \n     sectors to increase resources for relationship-centric \n     supports for youth in communities, schools, and workplaces: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes ``National Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the caring adults who serve as staff and \n     volunteers at quality mentoring programs and help the young \n     people of the United States find inner strength and reach \n     their full potential;\n       (3) acknowledges that mentoring supports educational \n     achievement, engagement, and self-confidence, supports young \n     people in setting career goals and expanding social capital, \n     reduces juvenile delinquency, and strengthens communities;\n       (4) promotes the establishment and expansion of quality \n     mentoring programs across the United States to equip young \n     people with the tools needed to lead healthy and productive \n     lives; and\n       (5) supports initiatives to close the ``mentoring gap'' \n     that exists for the many young people in the United States \n     who do not have meaningful connections with adults outside \n     the home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Con. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas, more than 200 years ago, the Act entitled ``An Act \n     making provision for the civilization of the Indian tribes \n     adjoining the frontier settlements'', approved March 3, 1819 \n     (3 Stat. 516, chapter 85) (commonly known as the \n     ``Civilization Fund Act''), was enacted and ushered in \n     devastating policies and practices designed to assimilate \n     American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children \n     by removing the children from their families and Native \n     communities throughout the United States;\n       Whereas that Act intended to resolve what was commonly \n     referred to in the United States as the ``Indian problem'' \n     and was based on the unjust belief of many that Native people \n     needed to be ``civilized'' and that education would be the \n     appropriate vehicle to enact assimilationist policies on \n     Native American people;\n       Whereas, pursuant to that Act, numerous church- and \n     government-operated boarding schools were established on and \n     off Indian territories and homelands to house and educate \n     numerous Native American children through policies and \n     practices that sought to eliminate the cultural identity of \n     Native children and assimilate them into mainstream United \n     States society;\n       Whereas, according to the Native American Rights Fund, \n     Native American families were torn apart by the removal of \n     Native American children, either voluntarily or forcibly, \n     from their homelands and communities to attend Indian \n     boarding schools located across the country;\n       Whereas many parents of children sent to Indian boarding \n     schools were forbidden to contact or visit their children, \n     compounding the problem of isolation that negatively impacted \n     and continues to impact the lives of many Native children, \n     their families, and their communities;\n       Whereas the Native American Rights Fund also reported that \n     an unidentified number of Native children died at Indian \n     boarding schools due to abuse, neglect, malnourishment, or \n     disease, and many of those children were buried far from \n     their homes in unmarked graves or under tombstones that \n     misidentified the children or ascribed Anglicized names to \n     the children;\n       Whereas many of the parents of children who died at Indian \n     boarding schools were never informed of the fate of their \n     children;\n       Whereas, according to a report issued by the Native \n     American Rights Fund, many survivors of Indian boarding \n     schools have testified that Indian boarding schools stripped \n     Native American children of their traditional cultures, \n     languages, and religions by forbidding the children to wear \n     traditional clothing, speak their Indigenous languages, or \n     practice their cultural, religious, or spiritual beliefs, and \n     many of the boarding schools are known to have severely \n     punished children who violated these policies through verbal, \n     psychological, and physical abuse;\n       Whereas many survivors of Indian boarding schools and \n     families of children who attended those schools have \n     recounted details of the physical, sexual, and psychological \n     abuse that countless Native American children endured while \n     attending the schools;\n       Whereas, according to the report entitled ``The Problem of \n     Indian Administration'' and dated February 21, 1928 (commonly \n     known as the ``Meriam Report''), many Indian boarding schools \n     sent students to nearby communities for forced manual work as \n     servants or farm laborers, and the operation of many Indian \n     boarding schools was supported by the labor of the students;\n       Whereas the Federal policy of Indian assimilation and \n     education has proven to be a disastrous failure and a \n     national tragedy;\n       Whereas, as stated in the report entitled ``Indian \n     Education: A National Tragedy--A National Challenge'' and \n     dated November 3, 1969 (Senate Report 91-501) (commonly known \n     as the ``Kennedy Report''), ``the dominant policy of the \n     Federal Government toward the American Indian has been one of \n     coercive assimilation'' that had ``disastrous effects'' on \n     the education of many Native American children;\n       Whereas, in 2018, the United States Commission on Civil \n     Rights reported that many American Indian and Alaska Native \n     people suffer from intergenerational trauma as a result of \n     policies and practices of Indian boarding schools that \n     alienated many children from their families, traditional \n     cultures, languages, and religions, and deprived those \n     children of their true identities and heritage;\n       Whereas, while early assimilationist policies were \n     eventually eliminated and Indian boarding school attendance \n     has greatly diminished since its apex, the impact of this \n     shameful period in United States history\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\n     still affects the lives of many Native American people today;\n       Whereas many Native American people are still suffering \n     from and trying to comprehend and cope with direct trauma, \n     including impacts on health and well-being, and the \n     intergenerational trauma, that resulted from losing \n     connection to family, culture, language, religion, and \n     heritage;\n       Whereas significant research shows that adverse childhood \n     experiences, such as the experiences of many Native American \n     children who attended Indian boarding schools and the \n     descendants of those children, can cause numerous negative \n     health outcomes, increased suicide rates, and other harmful \n     outcomes throughout life; and\n       Whereas recognition that healing and promotion of care for \n     the mind, body, and spirit is essential to overcoming the \n     dark shadows on United States history cast by Federal Indian \n     assimilationist policies and practices carried out by the \n     Federal Government through Indian boarding schools and \n     acknowledging the lived experiences of the Native American \n     children and families who endured and continue to endure the \n     trauma and grief associated with Indian boarding schools: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that there should be a \n     national day of remembrance for the Native American children \n     who died while attending a United States Indian boarding \n     school;\n       (2) Congress recognizes, honors, and supports the survivors \n     and the families and communities of children who attended \n     such schools; and\n       (3) Congress encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to support and recognize the grief, pain, and hardship \n     many Native American people suffered and still endure as a \n     result of the assimilationist policies and practices carried \n     out by the United States through Indian boarding school \n     policies;\n       (B) to honor the legacy of and remember those who were lost \n     or harmed by those policies and practices; and\n       (C) to appreciate the resilience of the survivors and their \n     families with appropriate ceremonies, programs, events, and \n     other activities to support and commemorate a national day of \n     remembrance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I believe we are all familiar with the \nquestion: If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, \ndoes it make a sound? Well, here in the U.S. Senate, we can ask the \nquestion: If we accomplish something important but fail to communicate \nthat to our constituents, did it actually happen?\n  The majority of the American people have so much on their plates that \nthey are not following the intricate, daily workings of this Chamber, \nso they expect their Senators to speak to them on a regular basis about \nthe work they are doing on their behalf.\n  As the author and former Presidential speechwriter James Humes has \nsaid: ``The art of communication is the language of leadership.'' That \nis why each and every one of us, in turn, relies on the dedicated men \nand women to help us communicate with folks back home.\n  I am here on the floor today to say farewell to a member of my team \nwho has been so instrumental in helping me communicate to the people of \nOregon.\n  For the past now 7\\1/2\\ years, Ray Zaccaro has served as my \ncommunications director. What a 7\\1/2\\ years it has been, especially \nwhen you consider how drastically the media and communications \nlandscape has changed in that 7\\1/2\\ years. We have gone from local \nnewspapers and cable news in serving as the dominant means of mass \ncommunication to Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat and \nTikTok and others that are far too numerous for me to keep track of, \nbut that is why we have a communications team.\n  One day, produced video content performed the best. The next, it was \nsuddenly selfie-style videos. Videos used to do very well on Facebook. \nWhen the algorithms changed, they didn't do so well. Then Instagram \nreels took off, and on and on and on. It is incredible how fast the \ncommunication world keeps changing. Since March of 2020, it has only \ngotten more chaotic as the pandemic has turned everything upside down, \nincluding how we consume information and how we communicate.\n  Ray Zaccaro expertly helped me and the entire team navigate this \never-shifting media landscape. As recording studios shut down, he \nmobilized the communications team to quickly transition to use a vast \narray of tools, including Skype and Zoom, so that we could continue to \nget our message and timely information to the people of Oregon.\n  That foresight and quick action are just extensions of his entire \napproach to communication--always challenging the members of our team \nto think outside the box and never being afraid to suggest new ideas, \nno matter how crazy they might initially seem. It doesn't matter if \nthey work in communications or on the legislative team or with \nconstituent services. He believes everyone on the team has a role to \nplay in helping to develop and tell the story of what we are working to \ndo. And he has proven right, time and time again, over the last 7-plus \nyears.\n\n  When Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General under the previous \nadministration,\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\ngave his ``zero tolerance'' speech, I said to my team: It sounds like \nhe is planning for a policy of tearing children out of their parents' \narms down at the border, and I am sure that is hyperbole because no \nAmerican administration would ever do that to children.\n  A member of my team said: There is one way to find out. Go down there \nyourself.\n  Well, Ray, who is sitting behind me on the bench, took that idea and \nran with it. We went down there the following Sunday, down to Texas, \nand he used his cell phone to livestream our attempts to try and \nascertain exactly what was happening to young boys and girls.\n  At a detention facility in McAllen, we were the first legislative \nteam to witness that, indeed, Team Trump was ripping children out of \ntheir parents' arms. I will never forget, as Ray and I walked into that \nfacility, there was a group of press outside who said: What are you \ngoing to find?\n  I said: I have no idea, but I will talk with you all when we come \nout.\n  Ray and I went in and saw those children in cages. And as we were \nbeing given a tour, I remember this group of young boys who were in one \nof the cages. They were being asked to line up--there were about 10 of \nthem--from the shortest to the tallest, and the youngest was knee-high \nto a grasshopper. He was just maybe 4 years old.\n  I asked: Where did these young boys come from?\n  He said: Well, we brought them in that door over there, and we took \nthem away from their parents.\n  And in that warehouse room, the parents were in other cyclone fence \ncages. And if the boys peered really hard, they might possibly see a \nparent or a sister, a father or mother, an uncle somewhere in that \nwarehouse, but they had no idea what fate awaited them.\n  We went outside and talked to the press outside and told them what \nwas happening. And in a flash, it was national news about what was \ngoing on by our government in their treatment of young children.\n  We went up the road to Brownsville. We had heard that there were a \nfew hundred boys possibly being held in a former Walmart. I thought \nthat was an astounding story, not possibly true, but should we go and \ncheck it out? Ray and I decided we would.\n  We went up to this former Walmart. It had barriers to keep you from \nparking in the former Walmart parking lot so we walked across the \ngrounds to the door, where, by cell phone, I called up the number that \nwas inside and said: We are here. I am a U.S. Senator, and we would \nlike to have a tour, please, of your facility, if we could speak with \nyour manager or your manager could come out and talk with us. \nEventually, the manager did come out. His assistant had said he would \nbe talking to us, but, actually, what he did was he called the police. \nAnd he didn't come out until the police cars were arriving.\n  I think Ray, who was livestreaming the whole thing, secretly wanted \nme to be arrested and carried off in handcuffs to magnify the impact of \nthe story. I am sorry, Ray, that it didn't come to that, but the story \nhad a tremendous impact.\n  They would not let me into that Walmart to see what was going on, but \nthe national scandal that ensued in the days that followed meant the \npress of the United States of America got in the following weekend, and \na national debate started about who are we as citizens of the United \nStates of America and who is our government and what are we doing to \nthese children?\n  It turned out there were not a few hundred boys in that facility; \nthere were a few boys short of 1,500 in that single former Walmart.\n  The work that Ray did that day revealed the truth of Trump's actions \nand shocked this Nation and moved this Nation to action. Horrified, as \nwe continued to learn about the realities of the situation, Ray kept up \nthe drumbeat with his contacts in the media throughout months that \nfollowed to ensure that that story of traumatized children and how we \ncan help them continued, and those children were never forgotten.\n  Let me be clear. It wasn't just the power of the story or the \nopportunity to get his boss--me--on television; he kept up the drumbeat \nbecause he is a passionate person who cares deeply about others.\n  Countless members of Team Merkley could recount stories about a time \nwhen Ray went out of his way to help them, to provide comfort and \nsupport when they were going through a difficult moment in their lives, \nor just a call to check in on how someone is doing or a full-blown \nItalian feast delivered to the home of a fellow team member grieving \nthe loss of a loved one. And as his work with those migrant children \nseparated from their parents at the border showed, he doesn't have to \nknow you personally to care deeply.\n  One time Ray was out with me in Oregon for a series of townhalls, and \na constituent showed up who was having a personal crisis. Ray went out \nof his way to make sure that man got the help he needed, while still \ncontinuing to do the other aspects of his job: attending to members of \nthe media, guiding and supporting staff in their respective tasks, and \nensuring that the constituent had everything he needed.\n  That is just who he is, the type of person who will drop everything \nif someone needs help, who will offer up his own apartment so his boss \ncan come film an important, last-minute video when the planned location \nfell through.\n  I couldn't begin to count how many late nights and early mornings we \nspent together sitting for media interviews. I am thinking right now, \nhere on the floor of the Senate, of a night a few years ago, when I was \nhere through the night, speaking for over 15 hours straight to protest \nthe theft of a Supreme Court seat by our former President and then-\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell. Throughout the night, there was Ray, \nin between running back and forth to the office to take calls from \nreporters and producers, returning to flip floor charts as my speech \nproceeded.\n  Thank you, Ray, for all that you have done for the team, for the \npeople of Oregon, and for the people of this Nation. Thank you for your \ntireless efforts to utilize communication tools at our disposal to \nprotect our democracy and enhance the important issues that face our \nNation, from healthcare to housing, to education, to living-wage jobs, \nto equality of opportunity, to taking on climate chaos. Thank you for \nbringing the passionate and longstanding commitment to democratic \npolitics and principals that were forged in your early experiences back \nhome in Long Island, and you brought them to Capitol Hill.\n  It is hard to picture what our Team Merkley experience will be after \nyou leave because you have been such an integral part for so long. But \nknow that while you will be deeply missed, we all wish you nothing but \nthe best in this next chapter of your life as you continue fighting to \nbuild a better world.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Res. 495\n\n       Whereas the Olympic Games should never be held in a country \n     whose government is actively committing genocide, forced \n     labor, and crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the ongoing crimes against humanity perpetrated by \n     the Chinese Communist Party in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous \n     Region include--\n       (1) the arbitrary imprisonment and other types of severe \n     deprivation of physical liberty of more than 1,800,000 \n     civilians;\n       (2) forced sterilization;\n       (3) forced abortion;\n       (4) infanticide;\n       (5) torture;\n       (6) forced labor; and\n       (7) restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom \n     of expression, and freedom of movement;\n       Whereas the Chinese Communist Party is committing ongoing \n     genocide as a direct attempt to forcibly ``assimilate'', or \n     eventually eliminate, vulnerable ethnic and religious groups;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1948, the United Nations General \n     Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Prevention \n     and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris \n     December 9, 1948 (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Genocide Convention''), as a commitment of ``never again'' \n     in response to the Holocaust and other crimes against \n     humanity committed in the first half of the 20th century;\n       Whereas, on November 5, 1988, the United States ratified \n     the Genocide Convention with the understanding that the \n     Genocide Convention declares that all state parties ``confirm \n     that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time \n     of war, is a crime under international law which they \n     undertake to prevent and to punish'';\n       Whereas, on January 19, 2021, former Secretary of State \n     Michael Pompeo determined that the Chinese Communist Party \n     has committed genocide and crimes against humanity, and \n     Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed agreement \n     with that determination;\n       Whereas, as of January 2022, 152 countries, including the \n     People's Republic of China, have ratified or acceded to the \n     Genocide Convention, and each such country has its own \n     national Olympic committee and is recognized by the \n     International Olympic Committee;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee should always \n     take human rights into account in making decisions, \n     especially in choosing a host country for the Olympic Games;\n       Whereas, in March 2020, human rights expert Rachel Davis \n     and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     HRH Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein submitted to the \n     International Olympic Committee a report containing human \n     rights recommendations;\n       Whereas, on December 2, 2020, the International Olympic \n     Committee announced that it would incorporate ``human rights \n     standards into the `Operational Requirements' of the Host \n     City Contract for the Olympic Games 2024 and beyond'', which \n     does not apply to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games;\n       Whereas, in their report, Rachel Davis and Zeid Ra'ad Al \n     Hussein--\n       (1) note that ``the human rights impacts that could be \n     connected to the [2022 Beijing Winter Olympic] Games are \n     severe--as our consultations with expert civil society \n     stakeholders also confirmed--and addressing them remains \n     challenging''; and\n       (2) urge the International Olympic Committee to consider \n     ``strengthening [human rights] due diligence across its \n     operations [before 2024] and advancing the agreed strategic \n     approach to engaging with Beijing 2022 on human rights, with \n     support from the top levels of the organization and informed \n     by the [International Olympic Committee's] own consultations \n     with expert stakeholders'';\n       Whereas there are no human rights conditions set forth in \n     the host city contract between the International Olympic \n     Committee and the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas there is no evidence that the International Olympic \n     Committee has taken any steps to pressure the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China to change its behavior;\n       Whereas the code of ethics of the International Olympic \n     Committee sets forth universal fundamental ethical principles \n     that are the foundation of Olympism, including--\n       (1) ``respect of the principle of the universality and \n     political neutrality of the Olympic Movement''; and\n       (2) ``maintaining harmonious relations with state \n     authorities, while respecting the principle of autonomy as \n     set out in the Olympic Charter'';\n\n       Whereas, historically, the International Olympic Committee \n     has not maintained political neutrality, including by--\n       (1) requiring the Government of Germany to accept qualified \n     Jewish athletes on German Olympic team during the 1936 \n     Olympic Games\n       (2) revoking South Africa's invitation in opposition to the \n     Government of South Africa's policy of apartheid during 1964 \n     Olympic Games, ; and\n       (3) in 1948, banning Germany and Japan from participating \n     in the first Olympic Games after World War II;\n       Whereas taking action against genocide and crimes against \n     humanity is a matter of morality, not politics;\n       Whereas the absence of rule of law and due process in the \n     People's Republic of China inhibits the ability of the \n     International Olympic Committee and the respective national \n     Olympic committees of participate countries to ensure the \n     safety of all athletes, staff, and spectators throughout the \n     duration of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games;\n       Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai \n     disappeared after stating that she had been sexually \n     assaulted and forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang \n     Gaoli, a former Vice Premier and member of the Chinese \n     Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee's acceptance of \n     the Chinese Communist Party cover-up of sexual assault \n     allegations and dismissal of safety concerns for Peng Shuai \n     call into question the International Olympic Committee's \n     willingness to protect athletes participating in the 2022 \n     Olympic Games in Beijing;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee should not \n     force athletes to choose between their conscience and their \n     pursuit of the highest goals in athletics;\n       Whereas Olympic athletes should not have to worry about--\n       (1) wearing clothing or consuming food that is a product of \n     forced labor; or\n       (2) being penalized or detained by the host government for \n     exercising their right to speak out against genocide, crimes \n     against humanity, and any other human rights abuse;\n       Whereas it is in the best interest of the athletes to move \n     the Olympic Games in fulfillment of the International Olympic \n     Committee's mission ``to promote safe sport and the \n     protection of athletes from all forms of harassment and \n     abuse'' and ``oppose any political or commercial abuse of \n     sport and athletes'';\n       Whereas, during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China broke its \n     commitment to the International Olympic Committee when it--\n       (1) displaced Chinese residents in order to construct \n     Olympic venues;\n       (2) detained demonstrators;\n       (3) censored the internet; and\n       (4) restricted media access and the freedom of speech;\n       Whereas the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games provided the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China the ability to \n     perpetuate propaganda and distract from ongoing human rights \n     abuses;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee should consider \n     the individuals who will not be able to celebrate the Olympic \n     spirit because they have been unjustly detained, imprisoned, \n     beaten, or worse by the government the International Olympic \n     Committee selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games;\n       Whereas it reflects poorly on the entire Olympic movement, \n     and therefore the international community in general, to \n     proceed with holding the Olympic Games in a country whose \n     government is committing genocide and crimes against \n     humanity;\n       Whereas, on March 24, 2020, 4 months before the start of \n     the 2020 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee \n     and\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\n     the Government of Japan announced the postponement of the \n     Tokyo Olympic Games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an action \n     that demonstrates the ability to postpone the Olympic Games \n     on short notice;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee has the right \n     to terminate the host city contract with the People's \n     Republic of China if, at any time, ``the IOC has reasonable \n     grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety \n     of participants in the Games would be seriously threatened or \n     jeopardized for any reason whatsoever'';\n       Whereas relocating the 2022 Winter Olympic Games due to \n     ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated by \n     the Government of the People's Republic of China is \n     consistent with the vision of the International Olympic \n     Committee to build a better world through sport; and\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee failed to \n     adhere to its own human rights commitments by extending the \n     honor of hosting the 2022 Olympic Games to Beijing, \n     particularly after Chinese authorities violated commitments \n     to the International Olympic Committee in 2008: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges--\n       (1) the International Olympic Committee to relocate the \n     2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games to another country in \n     response to the refusal of the People's Republic of China to \n     stop committing genocide and crimes against humanity;\n       (2) the International Olympic Committee to take human \n     rights into account in all decisions, especially in selecting \n     future host countries for the Olympic Games; and\n       (3) the Chinese Communist Party to immediately cease \n     harassment of tennis star Peng Shuai and ensure her safety \n     and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Hern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, over the last 2 years, the price of lumber \nrose at an astronomical rate. This followed prolonged shutdowns of \nlumber mills and production plants, despite the maintained demand for \nlumber for construction projects that continued as an essential \nactivity during the pandemic. The resulting supply and demand inversion \ncaused a nationwide lumber shortage.\n  Our economy struggles when businesses feel uncertainty in the market, \nwhich is why it is the government's job, in times of crisis like the \nCOVID pandemic, to ensure stability.\n  In May of last year, I sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative \nKatherine Tai urging action to prevent further disruption in the price \nof lumber. At the time I sent the letter, lumber prices had skyrocketed \nmore than 300 percent over the previous year. With the support of \nnearly 100 bipartisan Members of Congress, Congressman Brian Higgins \nand I asked Ambassador Tai to resolve the crisis by resuming trade \nnegotiations with Canada to reduce the price of softwood lumber.\n  While lumber prices temporarily declined following that letter, it \ntook months for a meaningful portion of those decreases to reach the \nconstruction industry and its customers. Prices began rising again in \nSeptember and have continued to increase in the months since, once \nagain putting strain on the hardworking Americans who build our homes \nand communities.\n  In December, I once again joined Congressman Higgins and nearly 100 \nbipartisan Members of Congress to send a second letter to the Biden \nadministration, this time to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, voicing \nconcerns over the Department of Commerce's decision to increase \nantidumping and countervailing duties on softwood lumber products from \nCanada. We are concerned that this will further exacerbate the lumber \ncrisis.\n  The housing sector remains an integral piece of the U.S. economy. As \nwe continue to recover from the COVID pandemic, sharp increases in the \nprice of lumber will further harm our recovery and the costs faced by \nhardworking Americans.\n  It is our understanding that the U.S. and Canada discussed this very \nissue last year and expressed mutual interest in resolving the problem, \nbut it is unclear if any action has yet been taken by either country.\n  We want to see stability and normalcy restored to the housing market. \nIt is imperative that we do so. We want to see definitive action from \nthe Biden administration to solve this problem.\n  Madam Speaker, we in Congress stand ready to help in any way we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Espaillat) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, as we come off the historic Martin \nLuther King, Jr., holiday, it is incumbent upon all of us not just to \nreflect on his legacy but to really honor it.\n  Honoring his legacy means really using our political strength, much \nof which was given to us by him and his struggle, to deliver the very \nvoting rights protections he and countless other civil rights leaders, \nincluding our very own John Lewis, bled to secure.\n  We simply cannot accept empty promises anymore, Madam Speaker, in \npursuit of his dream for a more equal and just America, not from \nSenators who have the power to live fully in those ideals today and not \nfrom Members of this very Chamber.\n  How can anyone, Madam Speaker, especially any Member of the Senate, \ncelebrate this day of service, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, without \nstanding for democracy and the rights of others?\n  How can they, in good faith, deliver empty words or celebrate his \nlegacy in the shadow of this current attack on access to the ballot box \nwhen they themselves have the power to stop it?\n\n  But let me step back just a minute and put this in perspective, Madam \nSpeaker. Just last year, Republicans introduced 440 voter suppression \nbills\n\n[[Page H222]]\n\nin 49 States. Nineteen States have already passed voting restrictions \nin 2021, with even more coming this year.\n  These are acts of voter suppression occurring in nearly every State \nof the Union, targeting Black and Brown communities, working-class and \npoor communities, telling them that their votes and voices shouldn't be \nheard, violating the sacred concept of one person, one vote.\n  Make no mistake, Madam Speaker: The restrictive voting laws that have \npassed and continue to be passed and pushed have directly targeted \nBlack and Brown poor and working-class communities, directly targeting \ncommunities of color to make it harder for them to access the ballot \nbox and to participate in our democracy.\n  As we continue to honor Dr. King and his legacy today, the Senate has \na choice: Abolish the filibuster or let democracy die.\n  Madam Speaker, the filibuster is an arcane piece of Senate procedure \nthat came to be by accident. It is a direct legacy to segregation and \ncontinues to hold back progress on civil rights to this very day.\n  Its most famous use was against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where \nits opponents filibustered for nearly 60 days. But it wasn't the first \ntime, and it won't be the last.\n  White southerners also invoked the filibuster to block a voting \nrights bill in 1891, with many of the same Senators filibustering again \nin the 1930s to block antilynching laws.\n  Imagine that. The filibuster was used to block antilynching laws.\n  We have a choice, Madam Speaker, between having a democracy or \nallowing racist systems to continue. It is simple. The filibuster is a \nmonument to white supremacy, and we have to tear it down.\n  I refuse to hear any cheap excuse about why protecting the very \nfounding principle of this Nation isn't possible because of it, not \nwhen it has been changed 161 times.\n  The filibuster, in the last five decades, has been changed 161 times \nto pass trade deals, tax cuts for the rich, Supreme Court Justices, and \njust recently for the debt ceiling.\n  But that is not what we remember the filibuster for. We remember the \nfilibuster for its racist roots, deeply embedded in Jim Crow, used to \nstop antilynching legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, history will not look fondly on those who stand in the \nway of progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nservice of Ellen Welch, a crime scene specialist in Morgan County and \nfounder of the Hero Tree.\n  Ellen has exhibited an unwavering commitment to Morgan County's law \nenforcement as she works as a crime scene specialist and investigator.\n  Each year, during the holiday season, Ellen takes on the role of \nlifting up the community's fallen law enforcement officers and K9s. \n2021 has marked the third year that Ellen has spearheaded this service \nto the community, and it continues to grow.\n  Every year, Ellen, her mom, and her niece paint each ornament and \nwrite the name, death date, and agency of each fallen officer. Then \nthey place the ornaments on a tree that stands in the Morgan County \nsquad room until January.\n  Unfortunately, this year was especially hard on law enforcement. \nEllen had to get a much larger tree as violence against police officers \nspiked.\n  Ellen has exhibited a selfless commitment to our police officers, and \nfor that, we are very grateful. I thank Ellen for what she does and \nencourage her to keep it up.\n\n\n                        Recognizing Ava Dorminey\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an \nextraordinary student in my district, Ava Dorminey, for her work \nbuilding the Students Helping Students Succeed mentorship program.\n  Now a senior at Savannah Arts Academy, Ava founded the SHSS \nmentorship program in her junior year to help struggling students.\n  The COVID-19 pandemic and related school closures, which proved \ndifficult for many students, are what prompted Ava to take action. Her \ndesire to help students' mental health and academic success culminated \nin the creation of the Students Helping Students Succeed mentorship \nprogram. Ava wanted to assist her fellow students while also working to \ninstill essential qualities like confidence, teamwork, and leadership \nin our youth.\n  Her work has been instrumental in helping students through these \ntrying times. I am extremely proud to represent a district where young \npeople's work, like Ava's, is on display for the whole Nation to see.\n  She inspires me and gives me even more confidence in our future, and \nI want to thank her for the work she is doing in our community.\n\n  I hope Ava's story and work inspire other young people to find an \navenue that can help their communities be successful as well.\n\n\n                     Congratulating Rincon, Georgia\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nRincon, Georgia, for being recognized as one of 24/7 Wall Street's best \ncities to live in, in the South.\n  Rincon is a gem of a town in the First District that is well \ndeserving of this recognition. Its population growth, high median \nhousehold income, and low unemployment rate are just some of the \nfeatures that caught the attention of 24/7 Wall Street, an independent \nnews organization that ranks cities based on affordability, quality of \nlife, economy, and community.\n  Incorporated as a city in 1927, Rincon has a rich history as a rail \ntown in the 1800s. When World War II came to America, Rincon, like the \nrest of the First District, answered the call to arms. Due to its \nproximity to Savannah, Rincon citizens were instrumental in the \nconstruction of U.S. Liberty ships.\n  Since then, the city has continued to grow and flourish into what it \nis today. I know the citizens of Rincon, Georgia, and myself are proud \nof this recognition.\n  As someone whose grandparents lived in Rincon, I was in Rincon most \nSundays every week as a young man. I can tell you how proud I am of the \ncity of Rincon and Effingham County and the tremendous growth they have \nseen while still maintaining a great quality of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to \nstand here this morning with a very solemn heart, overwhelmed, one \nwould say, with a sense of grief. And in that grief, there is joy.\n  The grief, of course, is to feel the personal pain of the lack of \nunity around the very core of democracy, and that is the right to vote.\n  As has been evidenced by Members over and over again, as I listened \nto Senators last night, everyone acceded to the point that voting is \nthe core of democracy. It means that the individual in pain, in \nfrustration, in affirmation, in the understanding of policies, gets to \nselect a person of their choosing. It is not about those who are \nelected or candidates or the elections. It is about the voters having \nthat right.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Right now, today, in the hands of the other body is the crux of \ndemocracy. I am, frankly, undone by the usage of an insignificant \nprocedural rule that has been used over the decades and centuries to \ncrush democracy.\n  The filibuster is insignificant. It is an order. It is not a statute; \nit is not the Constitution; it is not the 15th Amendment or the 14th \nAmendment; it is not the 13th Amendment, which freed slaves. It is also \nthe recognition that voting rights is for all persons irrespective of \ntheir race, color, creed, or religion, and their party affiliation.\n  Why is the other body, under the leadership of Minority Leader \nMcConnell, not coming to the table of unity? I extend an olive branch.\n  The filibuster has been changed already over 161 times. Do we \nrecognize that between 1866 and 1890 many landmark pieces of civil \nrights legislation\n\n[[Page H223]]\n\nthat were essential to protecting the constitutional rights of \nAmericans of color--this was during Reconstruction--they were, if you \nwill, voted along party lines? But from 1917 to 1994, civil rights were \ncrushed by the use of the filibuster.\n  And so I rise today to ask for the better angels of the other body, \ntwo Members who happen to be Democratic Senators, and others who are in \ntotal lockstep in the other party.\n  But listen to William E. Mason saying: ``But every schoolboy in the \nUnited States knows that the Senate is practically the only \nparliamentary body in the world where the majority cannot transact the \npublic business, and where the minority instead of the majority \ntransacts the business of the country.'' Senator William E. Mason, \nApril 21, 1897, a Republican.\n  I ask for mercy. As someone who worked for the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, who had the privilege of being here for the \nreauthorization in the mid-2000s, who wrote the Coretta Scott bill \nlegislation that was added that said no mid-term redistricting, and as \nwell helped rename the bill at that time to many icons of diversity.\n  I want to conclude my remarks by referring to Martin Luther King's \nmountaintop speech, to read as much of it as I can. He speaks at the \nbeginning by saying if he had sneezed when he was knifed by a demented \nwoman in the 1950s, he says, I wouldn't have been around in 1962 when \nNegroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up. And \nwhenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going \nsomewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent.\n  If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been here in 1963 when the Black \npeople of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this Nation \nand brought into being the civil rights bill.\n  If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have had a chance later that year, in \nAugust, to try and tell America about a dream that I had had.\n  If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been in Selma, Alabama, or Memphis.\n  And then they were telling me, now, it doesn't matter, now. It really \ndoesn't matter what happens. I left Atlanta this morning, and as we got \nstarted the pilot said we had to stop for a moment because Dr. Martin \nLuther King is on the plane, we have to check and see if there were \nbombs.\n  And then I got into Memphis. And some began to say the threats or \ntalk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some \nof our sick brothers, who did not look like me?\n  Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult \ndays ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now because I've been \nto the mountaintop.\n  And I don't mind.\n  Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its \nplace. But I am not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's \nwill. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked \nover, and I've seen the promised land.\n  That is today, today, January 19, 2022.\n  I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, \nas a people, will get to the promised land.\n  And so I'm happy tonight.\n  I'm not worried about anything.\n  I'm not fearing any man.\n  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\n  Those who say they honor him, do not disgrace him. Vote for the \nVoting Rights Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Pfluger) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true American \npatriot, a true American hero. Ms. Mary Lou Hand just turned 100 years \nold on January 15, 2022. She is from Wall, Texas.\n  Mary Lou served this country as a nurse in the Army in World War II. \nAfter first being stationed in Maryland and Mississippi, she was sent \nto England, where she provided critical care for the wounded; and, more \nimportantly, she raised soldiers' spirits by spreading laughter.\n  It was during her service in England that she met her husband, Bob. \nThe two had six children together and lived in three countries and \nsubsequently seven States.\n  Ms. Mary Lou Hand has 6 children, 13 grandchildren, 25 great-\ngrandchildren, and 3 great-great-grandchildren. She has cultivated a \nlife of love and family, filled with gratitude.\n  Throughout her century of life, she has dedicated her time to helping \nothers. Her selfless dedication has played out through her commitment \nto her family as well as her impressive career serving our country and \ncaring for others.\n\n  Mary Lou, thank you for your service and happy birthday.\n\n\n           Recognizing the Career of John ``J.B.'' Byers, Sr.\n\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to tell you about another \npatriot. You know, we have patriots, and we have leaders, servant \nleaders throughout our entire country. This is a special one that I \nwould like to talk about in the community of Staten Island, Mr. John \n``J.B.'' Byers, Sr.\n  A New Jersey native, Mr. Byers began his remarkable 40-year career \ndelivering letters for the U.S. Postal Service at the USPS Mariners \nHarbor Post Office and subsequently served 18 years at the Port \nRichmond office.\n  During his four decades of exemplary service, John has become a \nfixture of the community. He has become beloved by those he happily \nserved for so many years on his daily route.\n  The best measure of John's success was not how efficient he was at \nhis job, but it was the undeniable impact he had on his neighbors in \nthe communities that he served so well. He went above and beyond in his \nduties, taking time to engage in the community, the lives and the \nlivelihoods of the people he served every single day.\n  His influence is evident by the meaningful and positive impact he \nmade on those who knew him best, his neighbors, his colleagues, and his \nfriends. Story after story from coworkers and community members alike \nshow J.B.'s generosity, kindness, and work ethic. So much so that on \nJohn's last day at the U.S. Postal Service, those on his route threw \nhim a surprise party to demonstrate how much the service that he did \nfor them meant to them and their lives.\n  John dedicated his life to his community through his career, and he \nbecame a trusted friend and familiar face to all. But even with his \ntenured and successful career, I know the greatest joy for him today \nstems from the beautiful family he and his wife, Kathleen, have raised. \nAs he enters retirement, John and Kathleen are celebrating the birth of \ntheir first grandchild, Madison Patricia Byers, who was born on \nDecember 23, 2021.\n  More than a mailman, J.B. has brought great joy and integrity to \ncountless families and neighborhoods, and we thank him for his service \nto his community.\n\n\n                        Honoring Mrs. Pam Burke\n\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and \ndedication of Mrs. Pam Burke of San Angelo, Texas.\n  Mrs. Burke runs the Wesley Soup Kitchen, a wonderful ministry that \nhas been providing meals, along with love and care, to all those in \nneed since 1948.\n  Mrs. Burke has been at the Wesley Soup Kitchen for the past 12 years, \npreparing over 200 meals a day. In addition to feeding the homeless and \nthose less fortunate, this ministry provides holiday meals and has been \na consistent combatant of malnutrition and hunger throughout the \ncommunity.\n  Mrs. Burke is a wonderful example of God's calling in John, chapter \n21 to feed His sheep. For no monetary gain of her own, Mrs. Burke \ndedicates her time and her energy to opening her arms and caring for \nthe community.\n  I know I am not alone in saying that I am grateful for the mission of \nthe Wesley Soup Kitchen and am honored to know that wonderfully \nimpassioned individuals like Mrs. Pam Burke are working throughout each \nof our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, this great Nation was founded on a \nfundamental promise, a promise that, as\n\n[[Page H224]]\n\nAmericans, we shall all have a say in the decisions that affect our \nlives.\n  But as you know, this Nation has not always lived up to that promise. \nIndeed, the story of American democracy is a story of ordinary \nAmericans daring to make extraordinary sacrifices in order for the \npromise to become a reality for all Americans, regardless of their \nrace, gender, age, sexual orientation, or class.\n  Madam Speaker, today is a day of great significance and great \nconsequence. We, in the House, passed the John Robert Lewis Voting \nRights Act, as well as the Freedom to Vote Act. Now, today, the Senate \nwill take up and debate both bills and vote on the future of our \ndemocracy.\n  What is at stake is clear. The current state of voting rights is very \nclear. Old battles have become new again, as State legislatures across \nthis Nation have erected deliberate barriers to the ballot box in an \nall-out assault on the right to vote.\n  Though we no longer have a poll tax, nor do we have to count how many \njelly beans are in a jar, we do know that the modern-day restrictions \nare no less pernicious: Long lines, closed polling stations, purged \nvoter rolls, bans on early voting, and the list goes on and on. In \nGeorgia it is now a crime to hand out food and water to a voter in \nline. And so I ask you, What are we afraid of?\n  Madam Speaker, the significance of this moment is not lost on me for, \nyou see, representing Alabama's 7th Congressional District, voting \nrights are very personal. People in my district fought, marched, \nprayed, and, yes, some died for the equal right of all Americans to \nvote.\n  I know that this body reveres our late, great Congressman John Lewis. \nIt was John who said that the struggle for voting rights is not a \nstruggle for one day or one year, it is a struggle for a lifetime.\n  So we have to fight--every generation does--to protect the progress \nof the past and to advance it. And that is exactly what the John Robert \nLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act does.\n  I ask our Senators; how will they be remembered? Years from now, when \nour children and grandchildren look back on this moment and ask, What \ndid you do to fight for voting rights? How will you be remembered?\n  Now, we are not asking our Senators to march. We are not asking them \nto sacrifice. We are not asking them to bleed on a bridge.\n\n  We are asking them to do their jobs.\n  To do their jobs.\n  We are asking them to have the courage of their convictions, to use \ntheir position of great power to save our democracy in this critical \nmoment.\n  Madam Speaker, to my colleagues, voting rights advocates, and \nstakeholders, I say, no matter what the outcome is today, we cannot be \ndeterred. John Lewis and those brave foot soldiers did not give up. \nThink of where our country would be if John and Hosea Williams and \nthose that were bludgeoned on that bridge hadn't picked themselves up 2 \ndays later and marched again.\n  Voting rights is a struggle of a lifetime, and we have to be in that \nfight. We cannot be tired. We can be frustrated. We can be downright \nmad. But we cannot give up. We have so many more miles to go before we \ndeclare victory. And victory we must have because our democracy depends \non it.\n  Our colleague,  Jim Clyburn, this past weekend invoked the Bible. He \nsaid, it is darkest before the dawn. Indeed, by not taking this moment \nto protect the right to vote, we are allowing extremists to strip away \nthe power of the people.\n  We all celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday on Monday. Dr. \nKing said that `` . . . the arc of the moral universe is long, but it \nbends towards justice.'' But it only bends if we Americans decide to \nchallenge it, decide to make sure that this Constitution lives up to \nits ideals. It is time for the Senate to do their part.\n  In remembrance of the sacrifices of others, the Senate must reform \nits rules. We all have a role to play. And I say to the activists and \nto the Senators, the time to act is always now.\n  King said it is always time to do what is right. We must get into \nsome good trouble. We must keep our eyes on the prize, and the prize is \nour democracy and restoring the right to vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

These pieces of legislation \nare the ones Americans should be concerned about.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Madam Speaker, all Washington Democrats have done is operate off \ntheir own manufactured hysteria.\n  Thanks to ranking member Rodney Davis of the Committee on House \nAdministration, we have the facts on why the Democrats' narrative is \nwrong.\n  2020 saw the highest voter turnout in 120 years, and according to \nPew, 94 percent said it is easy to vote. There is clearly no widespread \n``voter suppression'' issue in this country.\n  Georgia's new ``voter suppression law'' has more days of early in-\nperson voting than New York.\n  Texas' ``voter suppression law'' ends pandemic exceptions like \nuniversal drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting. Neither existed in \nTexas before 2020. Neither widely exists even in blue States.\n  When it comes to abolishing the filibuster, there are even more \nfacts.\n  The filibuster prevents Federal laws swinging wildly with every \nelection.\n  If the filibuster is taken away, millions of citizens and entire \nStates would be silenced.\n  Senator Schumer's push is not a response to the 2020 election or new \nState laws.\n  As early as 2019 and August 2020, Senator Schumer was already \ndiscussing abolishing the filibuster, but only if he won control.\n  If the filibuster is wiped clean off the map, imagine what will be \ndone next: Packing the Supreme Court; ramming through the Green New \nDeal; defunding the police, and every other misguided item that \nWashington Democrats have in their political playbook.\n  The consequences would be disastrous for America.\n  Madam Speaker, Americans do not want the one-party rule agenda of \nWashington Democrats, the anniversary of which is tomorrow.\n  They do not want to see their own country become even more bankrupted \nby the failed policies under this administration and razor-thin \nmajority.\n  Republicans will continue to stand firm against this far-left agenda, \nand we will not sit on the sidelines.\n  It is vital that Americans know what these election bills will do and \nthe consequences that will affect this great country if they are \npassed.\n  Thank you again to Ranking Member Rodney Davis and his staff for \ntheir continued hard work and diligence on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Bacon) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to call upon my fellow Members \nof Congress to support H.R. 1179, which will award the Congressional \nGold Medal to the survivors of the Iran hostage crisis and to the \nfamilies of the former hostages who are, sadly, no longer with us.\n  Over 40 years ago, in November of 1979, protests in the Iranian \ncapital of Tehran led to crowds storming the United States Embassy and \ntaking the staff inside as hostages. Fifty-two Americans, made up of \nboth civilian and military personnel, were made prisoners in our own \nembassy and became victims of a terrorist attack upon international \nlaw.\n  For over a year, the hostages were denied their basic human dignity \nwith their captors inflicting upon them increasing physical and \npsychological torture, to include simulated executions. Madam Speaker, \nthey would take these hostages and go through the motions of being \nexecuted, often pulling the trigger of an empty gun to instill fear. It \nwas wrong. These brave Americans held strong throughout their harrowing \nordeal, never once losing faith in each other or that they may return \nhome to their families again. Their courage and patriotism are an \ninspiration to all of us today, just as it was to our Nation 40 years \nago.\n\n  Through diplomatic success, all 52 of the hostages were released in \nJanuary of 1981, free to return home to their loved ones and their \ncountry, with this January 20 marking the 41st anniversary of their \nfreedom. Despite that, many of them have not recovered from their \ntrauma; to this day still haunted by what they had to endure. Alongside \nhaving to carry these burdens for over 40 years, these 52 heroes never \nreceived proper recognition from their government for the sacrifices \nthey were forced to make in captivity. They are true American heroes, \nand it is time that Congress acknowledges them as such, which is why I \ncall upon my colleagues to support H.R. 1179. The awarding of the \nCongressional Gold Medal to the survivors and the families of the \ndeceased will not only bring justice to these patriots, but also \ndemonstrate this Nation's commitment to protect those whose human \nrights would be violated.\n  This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our Nation's ability to come \ntogether to honor our heroes; currently there are 145 cosponsors of \nthis bill with a near even split between Democrats and Republicans.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank the tremendous efforts of \nCommission 52 for helping to spread awareness of this bill and \ngathering support for it. Their commitment to righting the wrongs of \nover 40 years ago is an inspiration to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I rise today to make clear that we, as \nRepresentatives of the people, have a clear mandate to protect, \nrestore, and expand voting rights in our Nation.\n  In my hometown of Detroit, election workers and community members \nwere intimidated, shouted at, and disrespected for simply counting the \nvotes of our community, a majority Black community, in November of \n2020.\n  People banged on the windows, Madam Speaker, on the counting room \njust because they didn't want Black and Brown votes to be counted.\n  Our community was treated like we were unworthy of making our voices \nheard at the ballot box.\n  This should not be so complicated.\n  If our colleagues in the Senate fail to pass the Freedom to Vote: \nJohn R. Lewis Act, their inaction will send a clear message to folks \nthat voter suppression is okay. Voter suppression is not okay. It \nsimply is not. Intimidating our election workers is not okay.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, House Democrats this \npast week passed a bill to nationalize elections. On a party-line vote \nDemocrats, led by Speaker Pelosi, passed a bill nationalizing elections \nin an attempt to maintain power.\n  If ultimately enacted, this would consolidate power and control of \nall elections in the hands of Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Party.\n  This bill is an attack on election integrity.\n  Their claims of voter suppression could not be further from the \ntruth. The 2020 election had the highest turnout in 120 years.\n\n[[Page H226]]\n\n  A poll by Pew Research Center found that 94 percent of those asked \nsaid it was easy to vote. Thankfully there appears to be no path to get \nthe votes needed to pass this danger to democracy bill in the Senate.\n\n\n                March for Life is a Celebration of Life\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, later this week, tens of \nthousands of Americans will travel to D.C. to take part in the 48th \nMarch for Life.\n  They will not be alone. Across the country, Americans will march to \ntheir State capitals in protest of the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  This march is a celebration of life. It is a march full of joy. It is \ninspiring, it is peaceful, and it is welcoming to all who wish to \nattend.\n  Today, it continues to be the largest annual human rights \ndemonstration in the world. The goal is simple, to celebrate life with \nthe hope that one day we live in a world where every life is \ncelebrated, valued, and protected.\n  This year's theme is equality begins in the womb. As Jeanne Mancini, \npresident of the March of Life said best, ``As our country continues to \nadvance along the path to a more just society, we cannot ignore the \ndiscrimination that is taking place against vulnerable unborn babies. . \n. . ''\n  In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson penned three \nunalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  As Members of Congress, it is our job to uphold those rights.\n  Since coming to Congress in 2009, I am proud to be a strong proponent \nof standing for life and giving a voice to the voiceless.\n  Many of my colleagues have introduced legislation to advance the pro-\nlife cause. I am proud to cosponsor many of these bills, including the \nBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, the Defund Planned \nParenthood Act, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the Sanctity \nof Human Life Act, the Protecting the Dignity of the Unborn Children \nAct, and the Life at Conception Act.\n  In addition, I proudly stand on this House floor advocating for these \npolicies and thwarting any attacks on the unborn.\n  Madam Speaker, our country is at a turning point. Right now we are \nexperiencing the most pro-abortion administration in our history.\n  For the first time in over four decades, Democrats removed the Hyde \namendment from legislation. This amendment is a bipartisan agreement \nwhich prevents direct taxpayer funding of abortion and is supported by \n77 percent of Americans.\n  As pro-abortion advocates continue to try to stifle one of our \nunalienable rights, I know this House will continue to work tirelessly \nat the Federal level to put the health and safety of women and children \nfirst.\n  As long as the cloud of abortion looms over our country, we must \ncontinue to be the shining light for those who cannot defend \nthemselves.\n  Now I am proud of the brave women, men, and children who will travel \nto Washington this week.\n  We must always be a voice for the voiceless. And we must continue to \nbuild a culture that values life and respects mothers and their \nchildren.\n  Ahead of this year's march, I stand here and redouble my commitment \nto protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Underwood) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, the trauma, disruption, stress, and \nisolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the \nmental health crisis facing our young people. I have seen this \nreflected in my own community. My alma mater, Neuqua Valley High School \nin Naperville, Illinois, has lost two students to suicide just this \nschool year.\n  These are not isolated events. We are seeing the impacts of the youth \nmental health crisis play out in schools and communities across my \ndistrict and across the Nation. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago \nhas seen the number of children admitted as a result of suicide \nattempts increase from two to three children per month to two to three \nper day. There are now 3,000 children on their waitlist for outpatient \nmental healthcare. This is absolutely heartbreaking.\n  However, I find hope in seeing young people in my community stand up \nin the face of tragedy and demand solutions from their schools and \ngovernment officials. They shouldn't have to do this, but they are \norganizing, participating in school board meetings, and writing and \ncalling my office. I want them to know that I hear them, and I am \nfighting for them.\n  This summer, I introduced the Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal \nMeans Safety Act to invest in educating healthcare providers and \nevidence-based youth suicide prevention measures. It is absolutely \ncritical that we act immediately to address the growing unmet need for \nmore school-based mental health providers.\n  That is why I am fighting for the maximum possible funding through \nthe Department of Education for the school-based mental health \nworkforce in the omnibus appropriations package. I am inviting all \nMembers to join this bipartisan effort.\n  Last month, I was proud to join Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark to \nintroduce the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Act to provide \nconsistent, long-term funding to support schools in hiring more school-\nbased mental health providers and meet the recommended student-to-\nprovider ratios.\n  As we begin another year of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, we must \ntarget resources toward supporting the mental health of kids in school. \nAs U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in his recent advisory on \nyouth mental health: ``It would be a tragedy if we beat back one public \nhealth crisis only to allow another to grow in its place.''\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both the House and Senate to \nwork together and across the aisle to pass legislation, including a \nfiscal year 2022 spending package, that makes necessary investments in \ncombating the mental health crisis facing young people.\n  We must seize this critical opportunity to build better, safer, and \nmore supportive environments for our young people to grow and thrive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. McClain) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. McCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today because I need this \nCongress to understand the failures of President Biden as our Nation's \nCommander in Chief.\n  This administration was handed the reins to a country that had an \neconomy that was ready to bounce back after pandemic restrictions, a \nsouthern border that was more secure than any other point in our \nNation's history, and a foreign policy that had us respected around the \nglobe. Instead of simply being a caretaker, who ran on being a unifying \nforce--and I want to say that again; he ran on being a unifying force--\nthis President chose to play politics of division from day one and \nbegan dismantling all the positive policies of President Trump.\n  In January 2021, the President halted construction of the border wall \nand overturned countless immigration policies that clearly worked. \nThese policies stopped dangerous caravans from bringing thousands of \nillegal aliens to our southern border. These policies protected \nthousands of illegals from the horrors of human trafficking, and these \npolicies kept not only our country's borders safe but the community of \nthe entire world safe as well.\n  In this President's first year, he chose to spend trillions of \nAmerican tax dollars on COVID relief. He spent those dollars on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren when there was nearly a \ntrillion dollars from previous relief packages still unspent.\n  This wasteful spending that has included payments to keep people from \nworking has led to our Nation's supply chain disaster and the highest \ninflation in nearly 40 years, not to mention the labor shortage that we \nare facing now.\n\n[[Page H227]]\n\n  Last week, President Biden gave a speech in Georgia that was not only \ndivisive and hateful but downright despicable--from the man who ran on: \nI am going to unify this country.\n  He demanded that Congress give him what he wants, and anyone who \nopposes him is a racist and a bigot. Seriously? That is the best you \nhave? When you can't debate the issues, you resort to calling half of \nthe American people and anyone who doesn't agree with you a racist and \na bigot? I think the American people deserve a little bit better.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle railed against President \nTrump for anything they deemed divisive. So I ask them this: Will they \ncondemn this? Will they condemn their President for calling half of all \nAmericans racist? I doubt it.\n\n  Madam Speaker, I grew up through the disastrous Presidency of Jimmy \nCarter. President Carter is often considered the worst President in \nmodern history. It appears President Biden wants to take that crown.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

We must continue our work to end the \nscourge of abortion in America without exception.\n  The strides that we have made for the pro-life movement over recent \nyears are incredible, and I am honored to be part of a group of such \nhardworking pro-life legislators.\n  Our daughters are part of the pro-life generation, full of students \nand young women that want to protect life in the womb. They have seen \ntheir siblings in sonograms. They have seen the pictures, and when they \nare told it is a glob of tissue, they know better.\n  I introduced the Protecting Life on College Campuses Act, which would \nprohibit any Federal funds from going to a college or university which \nis supplying dangerous chemical abortion pills.\n  This past Christmas, the week before Christmas, while no one was \nlooking, the Biden administration and Governor Pritzker advanced very \nradical abortion policies, which are deeply unpopular with the American \npeople.

Shirley served as the vice \npresident until her retirement in 2012.\n\n[[Page H228]]\n\n  Our family also published a newspaper in central New York, and I have \nalways been inspired by Shirley's endless energy, good humor, and, yes, \nstrong opinions on many subjects--a woman after my own heart.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  I have also always been inspired by Shirley's tenacity and commitment \nto informing our community with depth and integrity, something that the \nRome Daily Sentinel has always done throughout its history.\n  In addition to being a publisher, Shirley was a beloved mother of \nfive who was active in her church and a member of our local artist \ncommunity. Shirley's paintings hang in galleries in our region and live \non to evoke wonder and inspire serenity to so many.\n  Shirley was also an honored member of the Order of Saint Barbara, as \nwell as an honorary member of the Northeast Air Defense Sector. Shirley \neven helped secure the B-52 bomber displayed in Rome at the entrance to \nthe former Griffiss Air Force Base, which she obtained from the \nnational B-52 museum committee.\n  On behalf of our community and those in the news business who are \ncommitted to serving the public as true members of the fourth estate, \nwe are grateful to Shirley Waters for being our standard-bearer. We are \nalso grateful to her for her distinguished service to our community \nbeyond her role as a newspaper publisher.\n  Her legacy will continue to live on in so many important ways, from \nthe great newspaper she leaves, the Rome Daily Sentinel, to her work \nwhich she also loved, to her works of art that are exhibited throughout \nour region, and her strong belief in our region's greatness and \nhistory.\n  My deepest condolences to the Waters family on the loss of this \nwonderful, venerable wife, mother, grandmother, and tenacious community \nleader with a wonderful sense of humor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of Trooper Kevin Beach\n\n  Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Rome Police Chief \nKevin Beach who will retire at the end of January after an incredible \ncareer and true devotion to public service.\n  Kevin first joined the Rome Police Department in September of 1994, \nfollowing in his father's footsteps. Kevin's father, Bruce, also served \nthe department for many years. Kevin showed leadership early on the job \nand was promoted quickly to the rank of detective after only 6 years.\n  In 2005, Kevin was appointed detective commander and then deputy \nchief in 2007. In 2008, he was appointed as the youngest police chief \nin the history of the city of Rome.\n  At just 36, Kevin had served the department for only 14 years but was \npicked for the top spot because of his exemplary track record and \nstrong leadership skills. Kevin's hard work, dedication, and love for \nthe city was evident every day he was on the job.\n  During his tenure as chief, the department introduced community \nprograms such as Shop with a Cop, Law Enforcement Day, and the creation \nof a Community Impact Unit. Kevin has also successfully navigated the \ndepartment through difficult times through the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe national defund the police movement.\n  Kevin, thank you for your lifetime of service and commitment to the \ncity of Rome. We are grateful for your devotion to service on behalf of \nyour community. I also want to thank you for your friendship and sage \ncounsel to me and so many others during your important work as our \nchief. May you enjoy a productive and healthy retirement.\n\n\n                  Recognition of Trooper David Draudt\n\n  Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, it is often said that law enforcement \nofficers work for a cause, not applause. This is certainly true and \ntoday I would like to recognize a trooper from the southern tier of New \nYork's 22nd district who deserves our applause.\n  Trooper David Draudt went to work on the morning of November 29 with \nthe intent to protect and serve. Yet, on that day Trooper Draudt not \nonly protected and served his community, but he also called on his \nextensive training to courageously save the life of an unresponsive 2-\nyear-old boy who had choked himself into unconsciousness. Trooper \nDraudt didn't lace up his boots that morning intent on saving a life. \nBut that is exactly what he did.\n  Law enforcement officers do not have the opportunity of choosing who \nor what they encounter each day. They rely on their training and their \nknowledge and their experiences to respond with honor, courage, and \nintegrity and, of course, compassion to whatever situation may arise. \nOn November 29, that is exactly what Trooper Draudt did.\n  Today, our cause is applause; applause not just for Trooper Draudt \nwho saved the life of a child, but to all who answer the call to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Coach Casto's remarkable coaching career comes to an end \nwith an overall record of 59 losses and 261 wins, including nine State \nchampionships.\n  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recognize this talented football \nteam and their remarkable coach.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Clyde) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the left's \nwidespread misinformation and hypocrisy surrounding the coronavirus \npandemic.\n  After repeatedly promising to shut down COVID-19 and vowing that all \nAmericans would have access to regular, reliable, and free testing, the \nBiden administration has added a new crisis to its growing list of \nfailures: the COVID crisis.\n  As our Nation faces a testing shortage, which began before the \nholiday season, I find it appropriate to quote President Biden himself \nfrom 2020: ``Where are the tests, Mr. President?''\n  Considering all the coronavirus funding that Congress has provided \nthe administration, that is the multitrillion-dollar question that has \nonly been answered with deflection and poor leadership.\n  Interestingly, now that the coronavirus death count is higher under \nPresident Biden than President Trump, the Centers for Disease Control, \nor the CDC, is apparently separating the data now to reveal how many \nAmericans have died with COVID compared to how many have died from \nCOVID.\n  Republicans have been shouting this difference from the rooftops for \nover 2 years, during which the left quickly labeled our valid concerns \nas conspiracies. Yet, when the important difference can provide cover \nto the President, Democrats jump on board, and the leftwing media hides \nthe hypocrisy. How convenient.\n  In fact, CDC Director Walensky recently admitted that 75 percent--\nyes, 75 percent--of COVID deaths occurred in people with at least four \ncomorbidities.\n  Every life is precious, and families deserve the truth. The question \nmust be answered: How many Americans died with COVID compared to how \nmany died from COVID? Our government agencies should have been \nreporting health data accurately from the beginning, not as a matter of \npolitical cover.\n  Since Biden can't shut down COVID, suddenly, this data is being \nshared publicly. It is no wonder polling indicates that public trust in \nthe CDC is plummeting.\n  Science is respected when people are skeptical, when people ask \nquestions. None of that is happening now. Nobody questions the \noutcomes. And we wonder why the CDC has lost credibility. We wonder why \npeople think the new meaning of the acronym is the center for Democrat \ncontrol.\n  Keep in mind, this is all unfolding as we discover more evidence that \nDr. Fauci, the highest-paid government official--an unelected one, I \nmight add--has continuously concealed the truth concerning gain of \nfunction research at the Chinese Wuhan Institute of Virology, including \nhis own knowledge and his own involvement.\n  Meanwhile, the administration continues to seek his deceptive \nguidance to push the narrative that we need more government control. \nFauci's lies, the CDC's total lack of credibility, and the President's \ninability to rise to the moment and effectively lead all contribute to \nthe COVID crisis, causing great damage and harm to the American people.\n\n\n                   Supporting Sanctity of Human Life\n\n  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the sanctity of \nhuman life.\n  Later this week, on January 22, our Nation will mourn the 49th \nanniversary of Roe v. Wade, a treacherous decision that has led to the \nmurder of more than 62 million innocent babies. That is more than 62 \nmillion dreams never achieved, talents never realized, and lives never \nlived. In the blink of an eye, their chance of a happy life and a \npromising future has vanished. May God have mercy on their unborn \nsouls.\n  What an unspeakable tragedy that corrupts the morals and values that \nour great country was founded on over two centuries ago. I am proud to \nhave cosponsored H. Res. 58, led by my good friend Jody Hice, to \nmemorialize the anniversary of Roe v. Wade as the day of tears by \nlowering our flag to half-staff each year in honor of the unborn lives \nlost to the evils of abortion.\n  After being involved with the crisis pregnancy center in Athens, \nGeorgia, for nearly two decades, I can confirm to you that the \nconsequences of abortion go well beyond the murder of millions of \nprecious lives. Despite being portrayed as a simple and quick solution, \nabortion ultimately alters at least three lives instead of one: a child \nthat is lost forever, a mother that is scarred for life, and a father \nthat is burdened with lifelong guilt.\n  We must never downplay the evils of abortion. As an unapologetic pro-\nlife advocate, I am proud to defend the unborn and fight for the \nsanctity of life because every life is invaluable, worthy, and made in \nthe perfect image of God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Unfortunately, the White House's latest response is to \nblame greedy businesses. Economists across the political spectrum are \nrightly calling out the White House for this foolishness.''\n  On Thursday, front-page headlines were shocking: Inflation for 2021 \nhighest in 40 years. Trend expected to last for months. Prices become \npotent political threat to Biden.\n  The Democrat elite think they are smarter than everyone and think \nDemocrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to believe that \ntrillion-dollar spending costs zero dollars.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected \nAmerica for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving \nfrom the Afghanistan safe haven to America, as sadly we saw with the \nsuicide bomber who attacked the synagogue in Texas on Saturday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, last year Democrats passed the American \nRescue Plan that provided funding to schools so they could reopen, \nfunding to cities and States so that first responders, municipal \nemployees, and county employees didn't get laid off, and it got \nstimulus checks to the American people.\n  As a result, we were able to have over 6 million jobs created since \nJanuary 20, 2020, and the lowest unemployment rate now in nearly 50 \nyears.\n  However, with the opening of our economies across the world, \ninflation has happened, including in the United States, and that is why \nI am so pleased that the Biden administration has announced $14 billion \nto go to 500 Army Corps of Engineers projects, including at ports to \nhelp with supply chain issues. By making sure we can move goods faster \nand easier and to address these supply chain issues, we will reduce the \ncost of goods, and that was because Democrats also passed the \ninfrastructure law. Democrats have delivered for the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

These are the \npeople who enriched the uranium during the Cold War; they live in \nsouthern Ohio where corporations have gone in, extracted resources, and \ntaken the profits out, and now we need to help this community get the \nkind of payment that they need. For all the radiation, all the \nsacrifice that they have made and endured over the years, it is long \npast time that the Federal Government increased the PILT payment for \nPike County, Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Dean) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nFitzgerald) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nextraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of \n2021, or PRRADA, is commonsense legislation that would promote greater \ntransparency and integrity with respect to the ongoing financial \nreorganization of Puerto Rico. This will be the third time in just over \n2 years that the House will vote on this legislation, but, Mr. Speaker, \nI think the third time will be the charm.\n  In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time, \nCongress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic \nStability Act, or PROMESA, in 2016.\n  That legislation established the Financial Oversight and Management \nBoard with control over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans, \nand regulations, and the authority to retain professionals to assist \nthe Board in executing its responsibilities.\n  Although largely patterned on Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, \nPROMESA did not incorporate all facets of Chapter 11 and other relevant \nprovisions of the code.\n  Importantly, this includes the code's mandatory disclosure \nrequirements regarding actual or potential conflicts of interest that \nprofessional persons seeking to be retained in a bankruptcy case must \nmake to the court prior to their retention.\n  This bill would close that loophole by conditioning the compensation \nof professional persons retained under PROMESA under certain \ndisclosures similar to those required under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Additionally, the bill would require the United States Trustee to \nreview these disclosures and to submit comments in response to the \ncourt, and it also authorizes the United States Trustee to object to \ncompensation requested by professionals.\n  And finally, H.R. 1192 would allow courts to deny compensation for \nservices and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person did \nnot comply with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested \nperson, or represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy \nestate. Common sense.\n  The House passed H.R. 1192 last February, and the Senate passed an \namended version of the Act last December. The Senate amendments \nstreamlined PRRADA's reporting requirements, strengthened the \nincentives for good faith compliance, and clarify other provisions of \nthe Act.\n  Now, Puerto Rico's restructuring is drawing to a close, which makes \npassage of this legislation especially urgent.\n  I thank Representative Velazquez for her leadership in championing \nthis bill and for her relentless dedication to ensuring that the people \nof Puerto Rico receive the fair, efficient, and transparent \nrestructuring process they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which was passed out of \nthe House last year and the year before by unanimous votes, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1192, the \nPuerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021.\n  In 2016, Puerto Rico was experiencing severe financial pressure from \nsignificant debt and related obligations.\n  In response to Puerto Rico's financial distress, Congress enacted the \nPuerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of 2016. \nThat 2016 law created a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico.\n  Like existing bankruptcy law in 2016, the law permitted certain \nprofessionals working on Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, like lawyers and \naccountants, to apply to get paid for their services pending judicial \napproval.\n  But the 2016 law lacked certain disclosure requirements for these \nprofessionals that would typically apply to restructuring professionals \nin other bankruptcy cases.\n  The gap in the 2016 law created the potential for undisclosed \nconflicts of interest for professionals involved in Puerto Rico's \nbankruptcy.\n  This bill fills the gap by mandating the necessary disclosure \nrequirements. The bill also establishes a process for overseeing and \npolicing disclosures that bankruptcy professionals make.\n  H.R. 1192 passed the House unanimously in February of 2021. In \nDecember, the Senate passed H.R. 1192 with a few minor amendments to \nimprove the bill's administrative abilities. The amendments also \nenhanced the incentives for professionals to make significant efforts \nto comply with the new disclosure requirements.\n  H.R. 1192 will serve important goals and interests, including the \ninterests of creditors and taxpayers and Puerto Rico itself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).\n  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the approval \nin the House of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico \nRecovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021.\n  I joined Representative Velazquez to promote this bipartisan and \ncommonsense bill to help ensure the restructuring process under PROMESA \nserves Puerto Rico's interests. Actually, just\n\n[[Page H232]]\n\nthis week, the plan was approved by the Federal Court, so this is \nperfect timing to approve this bill today.\n\n  Though it required some technical corrections, it is satisfying to \nsee this bill has already achieved passage in both Chambers. I wish for \nmy colleague, Congresswoman Velazquez, to be fully recovered in time to \nsee it become law.\n  The intent of this legislation remains the same, and this bill will \nrequire any person or firm hired as legal, financial or technical staff \nor consultants for the Financial Oversight Board in the court cases for \nthe restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt, to submit verified disclosures \nof all connections with debtors, creditors, or other interested parties \nin the process, before being compensated.\n  Our intention is not to exclude people with experience in Puerto \nRico's financial transactions from being resources in the restructuring \nprocess, but it is essential that their connection to any parties \ninterested in those transactions be known. Conflict of interest, or the \nappearance of conflict of interest, can be best avoided if there is \naccountability and transparency.\n  Anyone working to inform the Board's decisions, or representing it \nbefore the court, needs to be committed to defending the interests of \nthe people of Puerto Rico first, in accordance with the law and \njustice.\n  Lack of transparency creates a lack of trust, and this bill will work \ntoward avoiding that by making these disclosures a legal mandate rather \nthan the Board's own discretion.\n  Our goal is to reach the day we no longer need the provisions of \nPROMESA and the Oversight Board, but until that happens, these \ninstruments must be accountable and transparent.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the passage of the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of \n2021.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I just reiterate that I think there is a \nlot of support in the Chamber, and I support it as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 1192 closes a loophole under \ncurrent law by establishing disclosure requirements regarding actual or \npotential conflicts of interest in the bankruptcy process under \nPROMESA. In doing so, this legislation promotes transparency and \naccountability in the Puerto Rico restructuring process.\n  I thank my colleague, Representative Velazquez from New York, the \nauthor of the bill, for her leadership on this issue, and I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate \nAmendment to H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in \nDisclosures Act of 2021. I was proud to introduce this bill with \nbipartisan support in the House. I would like to thank House Speaker \nNancy Pelosi and Chairman Jerry Nadler for bringing this legislation to \nthe floor and to Senator Bob Menendez for introducing a companion bill \nin the Senate and for his tireless efforts to make sure this Bill would \nget approved in the Senate.\n  H.R. 1192 already unanimously passed this House back on February 24, \n2021 and I expect to do so the same today.\n  The Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021 or \n``PRRADA'' eliminates a double standard currently facing Puerto Rico. \nUnder U.S. Code and Federal Bankruptcy procedure, any conflicts of \ninterest--or even the perception of such conflict--between those \nworking on the bankruptcy and the debtor are required to be disclosed.\n  However, a loophole in the current law prevents this requirement from \nbeing extended to the people of Puerto Rico.\n  In 2016, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and \nEconomic Stability Act, otherwise known as PROMESA. When PROMESA was \noriginally passed, it incorporated Chapter 11's bankruptcy requirement \nthat professionals file fee applications with the court. But PROMESA \ndid not include Chapter 11's disclosure requirements that go hand-in-\nhand with those fee applications. PRRADA remedies this and makes sure \nthat professionals paid by the taxpayers of Puerto Rico are fully \ntransparent about what interests they are serving.\n  Puerto Ricans should be confident that the Board's bankruptcy \nadvisors do not have their ``thumb on the scale'' to favor certain \ndebts where they have a self-interest. This bipartisan bill ensures \nintegrity and transparency of the PROMESA process.\n  While we can have differing opinions on how effectively the Oversight \nBoard is carrying out its mission, one thing should be clear--the \nisland's residents should be entitled to the same rights and \nprotections as any debtor on the mainland.\n  Once more, I would like to thank Chairman Nadler, the Committee Staff \nand the bipartisan cosponsors of this bill. I strongly encourage all \nmembers to vote ``Yes'' on this critical piece of legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) that the House suspend the \nrules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 1192.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(S. 1404) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23d Headquarters \nSpecial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, popularly known as \nthe ``Ghost Army'', in recognition of their unique and highly \ndistinguished service in conducting deception operations in Europe \nduring World War II.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ghost Army Congressional \n     Gold Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops (comprised of the \n     23d Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Special Troops, \n     the 603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th Combat \n     Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal Service Company, and the \n     Signal Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops) \n     and the 3133d Signal Service Company were units of the United \n     States Army that served in Europe during World War II;\n       (2) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops was actively \n     engaged in battlefield operations from June of 1944 through \n     March of 1945;\n       (3) the 3133d Signal Service Company was engaged in \n     operations in Italy in 1945;\n       (4) the deceptive activities of these units were integral \n     to several Allied victories across Europe and reduced \n     casualties;\n       (5) in evaluating the performance of these units after \n     World War II, an Army analysis found that ``Rarely, if ever, \n     has there been a group of such a few men which had so great \n     an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.'';\n       (6) many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen-soldiers \n     recruited from art schools, advertising agencies, \n     communications companies, and other creative and technical \n     professions;\n       (7) the first 4 members of the 23d Headquarters Special \n     Troops landed on D-Day and 2 became casualties while creating \n     false beach landing sites;\n       (8) a detachment of Army radio operators under the command \n     of Lieutenant Fred Fox joined the invasion fleet for a \n     planned deception, Operation Troutfly, which was cancelled;\n       (9) Lieutenant Fox's men and their radios were instead \n     attached to the 82d Airborne, which had lost 95 percent of \n     its radio equipment, providing critical communications as the \n     82d Airborne fought its way inland;\n       (10) the secret deception operations of the 23d \n     Headquarters Special Troops commenced in France on June 14, \n     1944, when Task Force Mason, a 16-man detachment of the 23d \n     led by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, arrived in Normandy;\n       (11) Lieutenant Mason and his men set up dummy artillery to \n     draw enemy fire and protect the 980th Field Artillery \n     Battalion (VIII Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign;\n       (12) the rest of the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters \n     Special Troops arrived in France in July and August of 1944;\n       (13) full-scale deception efforts began with Operation \n     Elephant from July 1 to 4, 1944, in which the 23d \n     Headquarters Special Troops covered the movement of the 2d \n     Armored Division when it left a reserve position to go into \n     the line between the First United States and Second British \n     Armies;\n\n[[Page H233]]\n\n       (14) Operation Elephant was the first of the 21 full-scale \n     tactical deceptions completed by the 23d Headquarters Special \n     Troops;\n       (15) often operating on or near the front lines, the 23d \n     Headquarters Special Troops used inflatable tanks, artillery, \n     airplanes and other vehicles, advanced engineered \n     soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio trickery to create \n     the illusion of sizable American forces where there were none \n     and to draw the enemy away from Allied troops;\n       (16) the 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service Companies, \n     activated in Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York, at the Army \n     Experimental Station in March and June of 1944, respectively, \n     were the only ``sonic deception'' ground combat units of the \n     United States in World War II;\n       (17) soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops \n     impersonated other, larger Army units by sewing counterfeit \n     patches onto their uniforms, painting false markings on their \n     vehicles, and creating phony headquarters staffed by fake \n     generals, all in an effort to feed false information to Axis \n     spies;\n       (18) during the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d Headquarters \n     Special Troops created counterfeit radio traffic in an effort \n     to deceive the enemy of the movement of elements of General \n     George S. Patton's Third Army as it shifted to break through \n     to the 101st Airborne Division and elements of 10th Armored \n     Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne;\n       (19) in its final mission, Operation Viersen, in March \n     1945, the 23d Headquarters Special Troops conducted a \n     tactical deception operation intended to draw German units \n     down the Rhine River and away from the Ninth Army, allowing \n     the Ninth Army to cross the Rhine into Germany;\n       (20) during Operation Viersen, the 23d Headquarters Special \n     Troops, with the assistance of other units, impersonated 2 \n     complete divisions of American forces by using fabricated \n     radio networks, soundtracks of construction work and \n     artillery fire, and hundreds of inflatable and real vehicles;\n       (21) according to a military intelligence officer of the \n     79th Infantry, ``There is no doubt that Operation Viersen \n     materially assisted in deceiving the enemy with regard to the \n     real dispositions and intentions of this Army.'';\n       (22) 3 soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops gave \n     their lives and dozens were injured in carrying out their \n     mission;\n       (23) in April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service Company \n     conducted Operation Craftsman in support of Operation Second \n     Wind, the successful Allied effort to break through the \n     German defensive position to the north of Florence, Italy, \n     known as the Gothic Line;\n       (24) along with an attached platoon of British engineers, \n     who were inflatable decoy specialists, the 3133d Signal \n     Service Company used sonic deception to misrepresent troop \n     locations along this defensive line;\n       (25) the activities of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops \n     and the 3133d Signal Service Company remained highly \n     classified for more than 40 years after the war and received \n     minimal recognition;\n       (26) the extraordinary accomplishments of this unit are \n     deserving of belated official recognition; and\n       (27) the United States is eternally grateful to the \n     soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d \n     Signal Service Company for their proficient use of innovative \n     tactics during World War II, which saved lives and made \n     significant contributions to the defeat of the Axis powers.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The President Pro Tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall \n     make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of \n     Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the 23d \n     Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Services \n     Company, known collectively as the ``Ghost Army'', in \n     recognition of unique and highly distinguished service during \n     World War II.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike \n     the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal \n     under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the \n     Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be available for \n     display as appropriate and made available for research.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n     received under paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere, \n     particularly at other locations associated with the 23d \n     Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Services \n     Company.\n       (d) Duplicate Medals.--The Secretary may strike and sell \n     duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under this Act, \n     at a price sufficient to cover the cost of the medals, \n     including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \n     overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDAL.\n\n       (a) National Medal.--The medals struck under this Act are \n     national medals for the purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, \n     Unites States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purpose of section 5134 of title \n     31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act \n     shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of \n     the medals struck under this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3(d) shall \n     be deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund.\n\n     SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purposes of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Dean) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \non this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1404, the Ghost \nArmy Congressional Gold Medal Act. I thank the gentleman from \nMassachusetts, Senator Markey, and the gentlewoman from New Hampshire, \nCongresswoman Kuster, for their work on this bill which honors the \nresourcefulness, imagination, and artistry of the men of the 23rd \nHeadquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Company in conducting \ndeception operations in Europe during World War II.\n  This 1,100-man unit, known collectively as the Ghost Army, was made \nup of individuals recruited from creative fields, including art \nschools, theater and communications companies, and advertising \nagencies. Their mission was to draw upon their creative and artistic \ntalents to lure the German Army away from the Allied combat units \nthrough a series of tactical deception operations meant to confuse, \ndeceive, and mislead.\n  Following the D-Day landing in France, the Ghost Army undertook a \ntraveling road show utilizing fake radio transmissions, inflatable \ntanks, and theatrical sound and atmospheric effects to misdirect German \nunits away from actual Allied unit locations and toward larger \nimaginary ones.\n  The artists, architects, and engineers of the Ghost Army were so \neffective that a later Army analysis of their performance found that \n``rarely, if ever, has there been a group of such few men which had so \ngreat an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''\n  Yet, despite the overwhelming success of the citizen soldiers of the \nGhost Army, their contributions remained classified for over 40 years, \nand their bravery and ingenuity was never formally recognized.\n  This bill honors their unique contributions to the war effort by \ndirecting the Mint to strike a gold medal in honor of the Ghost Army. \nThe gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it \nwill be available for display and serve as recognition of the \nincredible service of the men of the Ghost Army during World War II.\n  I thank Mr. Markey and Ms. Kuster for their work on this bill, and I \nurge Members to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1404, the Ghost Army \nCongressional Gold Medal Act, the Senate version of H.R. 707, which the \nHouse passed in May 2021.\n  The Ghost Army, comprised of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, is \nrenowned for creating large-scale deception operations capable of \npulling Axis focus away from the actual movements of the Allied forces.\n\n[[Page H234]]\n\n  During the early phases of World War II, the 23rd division mastered \ntheir skill of deception by studying unit atmosphere and collecting \nmaterials for their new special effects tactics.\n  Knowing that enemy ground agents looked for vehicle bumper markings, \nAllied shoulder patches, and well-defined checkpoints, the 23rd \ncollected shoulder patches for phony major generals, created realistic \ninflatable vehicles and artillery, and even recorded the sounds of \nheavy machinery movements to sell their deception. They built their own \nmodern-day Trojan horse, down to the last detail.\n  The Ghost Army, unlike many other units, was comprised of civilian \nsoldiers with a proclivity for art, architecture, acting, set design, \nand engineering.\n  As Jack Masey, who was recruited into the Ghost Army at age 18, \nremembered: ``We were told we were going to be using inflatable \nequipment to try and fool the Germans into thinking that we were a real \narmy, when we were, in effect, I suppose, a rubber army.''\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Anyone who has watched a History Channel World War II documentary has \nundoubtedly seen the Ghost Army in action. The historic videos and \nherculean photos of four men holding a tank over their heads is a \ntestament to the Ghost Army's ingenuity and bravery during World War \nII.\n  The 23rd did not limit their deception to the battlefield. In fact, \non numerous occasions Ghosters were dispatched to French cafes near the \nfront of the war to order some omelets and talk loose among the spies \nwho might be there. The 23rd would go to great lengths to cause chaos \nand confusion, and they succeeded.\n  Mr. Speaker, recognizing these true American heroes hits close to \nhome for me, as the 77th Ghost Army veterans originated from the great \nState of Kentucky.\n  There is no doubt that the Ghost Army saved thousands of lives during \nWorld War II. Their unique and highly distinguished service during this \ngreat war should be recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. Kuster, for her leadership on \nthis, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DEAN. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire (Ms. Kuster).\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of \nveterans who have gone unrecognized for far too long.\n  In World War II, top secret units known as the Ghost Army used combat \ndeception to literally fool the Nazis. Their mission to was to divert \nenemy forces away from American combat units so that our troops faced \nless resistance. This required creativity and a special kind of \ncourage.\n  Whereas a typical American unit had tanks made of steel, the Ghost \nArmy, as you have heard from my colleagues, Mr. Barr and Ms. Dean, \nbuilt tanks made of rubber and wood. Using inflatable equipment and \nsonic deception, the Ghost Army made it appear as if there were tens of \nthousands of combat troops when there were literally none.\n  If the Germans ever discovered this ruse, the Ghost Army would have \nbeen annihilated. Throughout the war, the Ghost Army took this risk \nand, using their creativity and artistic talents, played a decisive \nrole in Allied combat operations.\n  As Mr. Barr noted, in evaluating the performance of these units after \nWorld War II, an Army analysis found rarely, if ever, has there been a \ngroup of such few men who had such great influence on the outcome of a \nmajor military campaign. I might note that was the campaign that turned \nthe tide of World War II.\n  To this day, combat deception units in the Army learn about the \ntactics that were used by the Ghost Army so many years ago. In this \nsense, the brave actions of the Ghost Army still are keeping Americans \nsafe to this day.\n  The Ghost Army's combat deceptions were so effective that the Army \nkept them classified for over 40 years after the war. Because of this \nclassification, the great men of the Ghost Army were never properly \nrecognized for their heroism and contributions to defeating fascism in \nEurope.\n  Mr. Speaker, as noted, the House passed the Ghost Army Congressional \nGold Medal Act that I introduced last spring. The Senate is now asking \npassage of the companion bill, S. 1404, introduced by Mr. Markey. This \nwould right the wrong by awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to those \nliving members of the Ghost Army. We will recognize the families of \nthose who have passed.\n  I am proud that 75 years after their service, the Ghost Army is \nfinally getting some of the recognition it earned.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize the contributions of so \nmany individuals in getting this bill over the finish line.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague, Representative Stewart, and his \nstaff for dedicating themselves to this bill.\n  I also want to recognize a good friend of mine, Rick Beyer, and Roy \nEichhorn. These two historians helped rediscover the Ghost Army's story \nand share it with the world.\n  Finally, I want to recognize all of the members of the Ghost Army \nLegacy Project. This coalition, made up largely of family members of \nGhost Army veterans, worked tirelessly to help Representative Stewart \nand myself secure the 292 House cosponsors necessary to pass this bill.\n  It is a testament to this institution that a handful of passionate \ncitizens, without the help of any special interest groups or lobbyists, \ncan build the support necessary to send this legislation to President \nBiden's desk. So it is fitting that we pass this bill today.\n  Of the more than 16 million Americans who served in World War II, \nbarely more than 240,000 are still alive, including just nine members \nof the Ghost Army. We should never forget the contributions of the \nGhost Army and all the servicemembers in World War II to preserve \ndemocracy around the world.\n  This is personal for me because my father, Malcolm McLane, was a \nfighter pilot and a POW during World War II. While today we rightfully \nsingle out the brave actions of the Ghost Army, I hope we also take a \nmoment to remember all of our World War II veterans.\n  In closing, I want to note what made the Ghost Army special was not \njust their extraordinary courage but their creativity. Their story \nreminds us that listening to unconventional ideas, like using visual \nand sound deception, can help us solve existential challenges like \ndefeating tyranny.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania. I thank my friend and colleague from New Hampshire.\n  I would just reiterate the significance of the Ghost Army. I thank my \ncolleagues for recognizing these extraordinary members of the Greatest \nGeneration and their significant contributions to our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1404, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  On a personal note, I would like to recognize First Lieutenant \nBernard Mason, mentioned in the text of this bill, for his leadership \nin leading the 16-man detachment of the 23rd Headquarters Special \nTroops during the invasion of Normandy. Lieutenant Mason was a \nconstituent of mine before his passing, and his wife and children still \nlive in my district. I want to thank them for Lieutenant Mason's life \nand service. Today we are finally honoring his service and those of his \nbrothers-in-arms in perpetuity.\n  The stories of the creativity and innovation displayed by the members \nof the Ghost Army during World War II read like something straight out \nof a Hollywood blockbuster script. The only thing missing is a \nHollywood ending where the brave members of the Ghost Army are finally \nrecognized for their lifesaving contributions to defeating the Axis \nPowers during World War II. This bill ensures official recognition for \nthis heroic group of citizen soldiers and their unique contributions to \nthe war effort.\n  I thank Mr. Markey and Ms. Kuster, the lead sponsor of the House \nversion of this bill, for ensuring that the stories of these men of the \nGhost Army receive the recognition they deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by\n\n[[Page H235]]\n\nthe gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1404.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(S. 452) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Willie O'Ree, in \nrecognition of his extraordinary contributions and commitment to \nhockey, inclusion, and recreational opportunity.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Willie O'Ree Congressional \n     Gold Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Willie O'Ree was the first Black player to compete in \n     the National Hockey League (NHL), appearing for the Boston \n     Bruins on January 18, 1958, in the throes of the civil rights \n     movement in the United States helping to end racial \n     segregation in the premier professional ice hockey league; he \n     is widely referred to as the ``Jackie Robinson of Hockey''.\n       (2) Willie O'Ree was born October 15, 1935, in Fredericton, \n     New Brunswick, Canada; he is the youngest of 13 children and \n     a descendant of Paris O'Ree, whose name appears in the famous \n     historical document ``The Book of Negroes''.\n       (3) Willie O'Ree was raised by his parents in Fredericton, \n     a predominantly White town where hockey was deeply rooted \n     within the culture. O'Ree was a standout athlete on the ice \n     and the baseball diamond.\n       (4) At age 21, O'Ree was being scouted by professional \n     baseball teams and seriously considered baseball as a career. \n     Upon experiencing the segregated South for the first time \n     while appearing for a minor league tryout, his dream changed \n     and his attention turned solely to ice hockey.\n       (5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie was struck in his \n     right eye with a puck and lost his eyesight. He was told by \n     doctors to abandon his hockey career; instead, never \n     disclosing the extent of his injury, he pursued his dream of \n     playing professional hockey.\n       (6) At the age of 22, O'Ree was called up from the Quebec \n     Aces of the Quebec Hockey League (QHL) to play for the NHL's \n     Boston Bruins at a time when only 6 teams existed in the \n     league. O'Ree was unaware he had broken the color barrier at \n     the top level of the sport until he read it in the newspaper \n     the following day.\n       (7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at times \n     throughout his career, O'Ree persevered and played \n     professional hockey for 22 years, tallying over 1,000 points.\n       (8) In 1996, 17 years after O'Ree retired from professional \n     hockey, the National Hockey League hired O'Ree as the first-\n     ever Diversity Ambassador. Having already changed the game \n     forever through his courage and convictions, O'Ree gives new \n     definition to what it means to be a trailblazer.\n       (9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador with the NHL, \n     O'Ree set out to grow the sport by providing access, \n     opportunity, and motivation for children of all races, \n     ethnicities, origins, and abilities. With O'Ree providing a \n     vivid example of what is possible and serving as a relentless \n     supporter of children pursuing their dreams, more than 30 \n     nonprofit youth organizations, dubbed Hockey is for Everyone \n     programs, were developed across North America, each committed \n     to offering minority and underserved children an opportunity \n     to play hockey, leveraging the sport to build character, \n     foster positive values, and develop important life skills.\n       (10) Through Hockey is for Everyone programs, more than \n     120,000 boys and girls have been positively impacted. O'Ree \n     has devoted nearly 2,500 days on the ground with the youth \n     participants, visiting more than 500 schools, community \n     centers, and rinks to speak to hockey's core values and \n     beliefs: stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain \n     committed and disciplined; and always respect your teammates, \n     coaches, and parents.\n       (11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have provided \n     important opportunities for youth to partake in physical \n     fitness. Today in the United States, fewer than half of the \n     children ages 6-11 engage in the recommended amount of \n     physical activity, and that number is lower for low-income \n     families. O'Ree has stood as a champion of youth athletic \n     participation and its health benefits for decades.\n       (12) Hockey is for Everyone programs provide numerous off-\n     ice services to youth: SAT and academic tutoring, mentoring, \n     nutrition education, college counseling, community service \n     opportunities, and more. The program has excelled at using \n     hockey as a vehicle to improve the social and emotional \n     wellness of youth and improve students' academic performances \n     both in primary school and beyond.\n       (13) O'Ree was also named a Member of the Order of Canada \n     in 2008 and, in 2018, the City of Boston released an official \n     Proclamation recognizing January 18, the anniversary of the \n     day he broke into the game, as ``Willie O'Ree Day''.\n       (14) In November 2018, 60 years after O'Ree entered the \n     NHL, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the \n     ``builder'' category in recognition of his efforts to grow \n     the game, using his position and the platform of hockey to \n     improve the lives of children throughout North America.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf \n     of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design \n     to Willie O'Ree, or if unavailable, to a member of his \n     family, in recognition of his extraordinary contributions and \n     commitment to hockey, inclusion, and recreational \n     opportunity.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary. The \n     design shall bear an image of, and an inscription of the name \n     of, Willie O'Ree.\n\n     SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may strike and sell \n     duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section \n     3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals, \n     including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \n     overhead expenses.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sales.--The amounts received from the sale \n     of duplicate medals under subsection (a) shall be deposited \n     in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n       (c) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of \n     the medals struck under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medal.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act \n     are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, \n     United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of \n     title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this \n     Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Dean) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \non this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 452, the Willie O'Ree \nCongressional Gold Medal Act.\n  I thank Michigan Senator Stabenow and the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Quigley) for their work on this bill which honors Willie O'Ree, a \ntrailblazer for diversity and inclusion in sports and the first Black \nplayer in the National Hockey League.\n  Born in 1935 in the predominantly White town of Fredericton, New \nBrunswick, Canada, O'Ree made a name for himself as a standout athlete \nin both ice hockey and baseball. At age 21, he was being scouted by \nprofessional baseball teams in the United States. However, upon \nexperiencing racial discrimination and the effects of segregation \nfirsthand while in the south for minor league tryouts, he shifted his \nfocus solely to ice hockey.\n  In 1958, at the age of 22, O'Ree was called up to play professionally \nas a winger for the NHL Boston Bruins. In doing so, he became the first \nBlack professional ice hockey player in the league. Despite being blind \nin one eye from an injury during his time as an amateur hockey player \nand enduring racist attacks from hockey fans and players alike, O'Ree \npersevered and continued to play professional hockey for 22 years.\n  In 1996, the National Hockey League hired O'Ree as its first-ever \ndiversity ambassador, which set out to transform the predominantly \nWhite sport of ice hockey by providing greater access and opportunity \nfor children of all races, ethnicities, and origins.\n\n[[Page H236]]\n\n  O'Ree has personally devoted thousands of hours to Hockey is for \nEveryone programs which provide community outreach and support for \nyouth participants to partake in physical fitness and live out hockey's \ncore values of commitment, discipline, and respect for your teammates, \ncoaches, and parents.\n  In 2018, 60 years after O'Ree first broke the color barrier for ice \nhockey, he was inducted into the NHL Hockey Hall of Fame in recognition \nof his longstanding support for greater access and diversity in the \nsport.\n  This bill honors O'Ree's trailblazing legacy both on and off the ice. \nI thank Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Quigley for their work on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge members to vote ``yes'' and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of S. 452, the Willie O'Ree Congressional Gold \nMedal Act.\n  Willie O'Ree's story is one of determination and perseverance, one of \nthe greatest qualities a human being can have.\n  Willie, born October 15, 1935, was the youngest of 13 children of \nparents Rosebud and Harry O'Ree. The O'Ree family was one of only two \nBlack families that lived in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Willie is a \ndescendent of Paris O'Ree, a slave who escaped servitude in South \nCarolina in the late 1700s at only 15 years old.\n  When he was 3, Willie fashioned skates out of wooden blocks with \nmetal blades attached to the bottom and took to his frozen lawn in the \nbackyard. He had a knack for skating. Two years later at age 5, Willie \nbegan to play organized hockey. Many refer to Willie as the ``Jackie \nRobinson of hockey.''\n  Interestingly, at Dodger Stadium in 1949, 2 years after Robinson \nbroke baseball's color barrier, a 14-year-old O'Ree had the opportunity \nto meet his hero. In one interview, Willie recalls that as Robinson \nmade his way down to the receiving line, Willie waited patiently. When \nhis turn arrived, he spoke to Jackie and said, I am a baseball player. \nBut what I really love is hockey.\n  Robinson replied, Oh, I didn't know Black kids played hockey.\n  Nearly 9 years later, on January 18, 1958, Willie put on a Boston \nBruins uniform for a game against the Montreal Canadians and became the \nfirst Black player in NHL history.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  From 1958 to 1961, O'Ree played in 45 games for the Bruins, all while \nhiding a secret that he was, in fact, blind in one eye.\n  Willie paved the way for a new generation of hockey players. Wayne \nSimmonds of the Toronto Maple Leafs was quoted as stating:\n\n       Willie set the table for everyone else to eat, and he did \n     it all with dignity and class. I used to think about Willie's \n     story whenever teachers or hockey parents or coaches would \n     laugh at my dream of making it to the NHL.\n\n  Willie's story did not end after he left the ice. Seventeen years \nafter he retired from professional hockey, the NHL hired O'Ree as their \nfirst-ever diversity ambassador. This role put Willie in a position to \ngrow the sport by providing access, opportunity, and motivation for \nchildren of all races, ethnicities, origins, and abilities.\n  In November of 2018, O'Ree was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, \nand just last night, 64 years to the day of his historic entrance into \nthe league, his number 22 jersey was raised to the rafters in TD Garden \nand retired; an act of ultimate recognition of what a player means to a \nfranchise, a fan base, and a community.\n  Mr. Speaker, Willie O'Ree forever changed the sport of hockey. His \ndetermination and perseverance should be recognized with a \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley).\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago our country took time to \ncelebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on our \nongoing effort to ensure racial equality in America. It is fitting then \nthat today this body considers legislation to honor the life of Willie \nO'Ree who, like Dr. King, was on the frontlines of racial integration \nin America and has dedicated his life to the ideals of diversity and \ninclusion.\n  In 1958, Willie O'Ree integrated the sport of hockey by becoming the \nfirst Black player in the National Hockey League. Well, known are the \nstories of barrier-breaking athletes like Jackie Robinson in baseball \nand Bill Russell in basketball; Mr. O'Ree's story is lesser known.\n  He was born in Canada, the youngest of 13 children. His grandfather, \nParis O'Ree, escaped slavery in South Carolina and fled to Canada. \nGrowing up in Canada, O'Ree quickly developed a love and talent for \nhockey. During his early years playing hockey, he was blinded in one \neye by a stray puck. However, this setback did not deter him from his \ndream of playing professional hockey. A few years later, Willie finally \ngot the call to play in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, becoming the \nfirst Black player to do so.\n  But the road ahead was not an easy one. During his time playing for \nthe Bruins, Willie endured racist slurs by fans and opposing teams. He \nsuffered illegal hits and rough treatment constantly. But that was not \nenough to deter him. He remained committed to playing hockey and would \ndo so for 22 years in the NHL and the minor leagues. Think about that, \nMr. Speaker, he played 22 years of professional hockey while enduring \nracism and bigotry; oh, and only having vision in one eye.\n  Willie never intended to stop the fight for inclusion in the league \nonce he left playing hockey. After hanging up his skates, he became the \nNHL's diversity ambassador, a role he continues to this day.\n  In the 1990s, he established the Hockey is for Everyone initiative to \noffer marginalized and underrepresented children an opportunity to play \nhockey and develop important life skills. Since its inception, more \nthan 120,000 children have participated in the program.\n  After his remarkable career on and off the ice, Willie has begun to \nreceive the recognition he has long deserved. In 2018, he was inducted \ninto the Hockey Hall of Fame, and just last night, his jersey was \nretired by the Boston Bruins.\n  It has been my honor to know Willie over the past decade and help \nlead this bill to award him a Congressional Gold Medal. I am thankful \nto my colleagues, Representatives Higgins, Pressley, Emmer, and Katko, \nwho led this legislation in the House with me, and Senators Stabenow \nand Scott who led this bill in the Senate.\n  When I was young, my heroes were hockey players. They were talented, \nstrong, and skilled. They taught me many things. At the time they were \nall White. Willie fought his entire life to change that during and \nafter his career. Hockey, the sports world, and our country are better \noff because of his efforts.\n  I had no idea that the year I was born Willie O'Ree broke the color \nbarrier in hockey. And it wasn't until many years later when I had the \nhonor of meeting him that I learned that my own heroes from the Chicago \nBlackhawks and their fans gave him some of the harshest treatment \nduring his time in the NHL.\n  But his life has been a true testament to those values I learned as a \nyoung hockey fan: strength, courage, and perseverance even in the face \nof tremendous odds. He is a true gift to our country and to a sport \nthat I and so many others love. Awarding him the Congressional Gold \nMedal will serve as a small but important token of our country's \ngratitude.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer). This Member of Congress not only \nplayed collegiate hockey, he is a hockey dad, and spent over 20 years \nas a hockey coach, he is one of the best fans of the game of hockey in \nthe United States Congress.\n  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 452, the Willie \nO'Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act, and to recognize the incredible \nimpact that Willie O'Ree has had on the great sport of hockey.\n  Willie etched his name into the history books in 1958. When he became \none of the select few--and it is a very few--who got called up from the \nminors to play in the National Hockey League for the Boston Bruins, \nWillie broke down racial barriers for sure. He would go on\n\n[[Page H237]]\n\nto play more than 24 seasons as a professional hockey player, despite \nfacing countless challenges on and off the ice.\n\n  Willie O'Ree remains a trailblazer for many, but his contributions \ncertainly did not end after his retirement from his playing career in \n1979. As we have heard, in 1996, he became the NHL's diversity \nambassador. In this capacity, he established the Hockey is for Everyone \ninitiative to create a culture of inclusivity and provide an \nopportunity for disadvantaged children across this country and North \nAmerica to play the game. His work continues even to this day to \nreinvigorate and grow the great sport of hockey while setting an \nexample for underrepresented communities here at home and on an \ninternational level.\n  As the NHL and teams across the country finally recognized Willie \nO'Ree's incredible contributions to hockey, today is Congress' \nopportunity to honor a true legend of the game that is loved and \nenjoyed by millions.\n  Remember, we know that hockey was given to us directly from God \nbecause it is played on ice, which can only exist in Heaven.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead this long overdue effort, and I \nurge all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to honor this \nicon of our God-given sport by voting ``yes'' on S. 452.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Pressley).\n  Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our bill, the \nWillie O'Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act, legislation which honors the \nhistoric career and life of service of the one and only Willie O'Ree.\n  With today's vote in the people's House, we honor a giant, and it has \nbeen an honor to be a steward in this effort. Willie is a trailblazer, \nan ice breaker, a hero, and an activist whose powerful story is unknown \nto too many. That ends here today. We change that.\n  Mr. Speaker, 64 years ago, in the midst of the fight to end Jim Crow, \nWillie O'Ree made history with the Boston Bruins by becoming the first \nBlack player to play in the National Hockey League.\n  A descendant of enslaved people who escaped the horrors of slavery \nthrough the Underground Railroad, Willie was born and raised in New \nBrunswick, Canada, and was the youngest of 13 children. His love of the \ngame began at the young age of 3 when he earned his stripes playing \nalongside his older siblings.\n  Known as the Jackie Robinson of hockey, Willie played 45 games in the \nNHL and spent more than two decades playing professional hockey--all \nwhile hiding the fact that he was nearly completely bind in one eye.\n  Willie O'Ree was a young and fast left winger, but he could not out-\nskate the racist backlash in response to his desegregating the National \nHockey League. As the sole Black player in the NHL at the time, Willie \nendured relentless bigotry, racism, discrimination, and even violence \nfrom fans and players both on and off the ice. And despite it all, \nWillie embodied resilience, grace, dignity, and never gave up on the \ndetermination to live out his dream.\n  In the decades following his historic career on the ice, Willie has \nspent his time paying it forward to the next generation of ice \nbreakers. As the NHL's director of youth development and diversity \nambassador, he has worked to increase opportunities for young Black and \nBrown players so that they too can take their rightful place in the big \nleague.\n  In 2018, Willie was formally inducted into the NHL Hall of Fame; and \nwhile his time with the Boston Bruins was short, his legacy lives on to \nthis very day. Earlier this week, Mayor Michelle Wu declared January 18 \nin the city of Boston Willie O'Ree Day marking the momentous day 64 \nyears ago when Willie hit the ice and changed the game forever.\n  Just yesterday, the Boston Bruins formally retired Willie's number 22 \njersey, raising it up in the rafters at the Garden alongside other \nBruins legends.\n  Mr. Speaker, Black history is American history, and today we salute \nan American hero and inspiration. Willie demonstrates for us the power \nof holding on to one's dreams--an ice and ceiling breaker.\n  I would like to thank my esteemed colleagues, Representatives \nQuigley, Katko, and Emmer, for their partnership, and the 290 \ncolleagues who cosponsored this piece of legislation in order to get it \nacross the finish line. My team and I have been working diligently \npushing and organizing since 2019, and this work would not have been \npossible without the support and partnership of the longtime grassroots \nactivists who organized to ensure that Willie, who took up space and \nwho created space, now takes his rightful space in our history books.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is Congress' highest expression of \nnational appreciation and recognition. With this honor, Willie will \njoin history-makers like Jackie Robinson, the Reverend Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King, and the Tuskegee Airmen-- \nincredible company for an incredible man.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Massachusetts an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, at the age of 86 years young today, we \ngive Willie O'Ree his flowers.\n  Go Bruins.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to, once again, reiterate \nthe significance of this Congressional Gold Medal. Willie O'Ree not \nonly forever changed the sport of hockey, but he truly helped change \nthe history of this country. His determination and perseverance and his \ntrailblazing spirit should be recognized with a Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Higgins).\n  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. \n452, the Willie O'Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act.\n  Willie O'Ree, which has been already said, was a trailblazer for \nhockey both on and off the ice. He was to the National Hockey League \nwhat Jackie Robinson was to Major League Baseball.\n  As the first Black player in the National Hockey League, he endured \nracism, bigotry, and prejudice from both players and fans. Despite \nthis, he played more than two decades in the National Hockey League and \nin the minor leagues developing his skills and later becoming the \nNational Hockey League's diversity ambassador.\n  Willie O'Ree broke down historic barriers and paved the way for young \nathletes in marginalized communities. In 2012, he visited my community \nfor the Willie O'Ree Skills Weekend hosted by the National Hockey \nLeague Buffalo Sabres. Today we honor his dedication to improving \ndiversity and accessibility in sports which makes him most deserving of \nthis high honor.\n  He is an inspiration to all athletes, and particularly to young \nathletes of color in western New York and throughout the Nation. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Willie O'Ree is often referred to as the ``Jackie Robinson of ice \nhockey'' for helping to end racial segregation in the National Hockey \nLeague. Mr. O'Ree's positive impact on the sport of ice hockey goes far \nbeyond his role in ending racial segregation in the sport.\n  This bill honors O'Ree for both his barrier-breaking role and his \ndecades of championing diversity and greater youth access to the sport. \nI thank Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Quigley, the lead sponsor of the House \nversion of the bill, and our other colleagues who worked so hard on \nthis bill for ensuring that Mr. O'Ree and his trailblazing legacy of \nsportsmanship and inclusion receive the recognition he so richly \ndeserves.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, on November 12, Medicare announced the \nlargest part B premium increase in the history of the Medicare program, \n14 percent. This could not come at a worse time in terms of, again, the \ncost of living that many seniors are facing.\n  Looking closely at that decision, one of the driving factors was the \nprojected cost of the drug Aduhelm, which was priced at $56,000 per \nyear for Alzheimer's patients who were, again, very excited about the \npossibility of getting the benefit of that drug. But the cost of that \ndrug was one of the big driving forces for a 14 percent rate increase.\n  On December 20, Biogen, the manufacturer, cut the cost of that drug \nfrom $56,000 to $28,000. About 2 weeks ago, Secretary Becerra correctly \ninstructed the actuaries of Medicare to go back and try and recalculate \nthe Medicare part B premium to see if there was a way to get some \nrelief for seniors from that 14 percent rate increase.\n  Today, 31 Members of the House Democratic Caucus are sending a letter \nto Secretary Becerra again applauding his decision and strongly \nadvocating that Medicare go back in and recalculate that rate increase, \nwhich will provide tremendous assistance for seniors at exactly the \ntime that they need it.\n\n[[Page H239]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the \nJewish community, with Jewish parents, with our rabbis, people who are \nstill reeling in the aftermath of yet another attack on one of their \nhouses of worship.\n  Anti-Semitism is real and growing, and it is a threat to our \nneighbors and to our collective conscience in this country. Paired with \nnear-unfettered access to firearms, spaces for online hate to fester, \nand the echo of xenophobic dog whistles from our Nation's highest \noffices, it has and can cost us American lives.\n  We have failed when our educators and faith leaders need to \nsupplement their daily duties with violence intervention rehearsals. We \nhave failed when our students and congregants need to calculate exit \nplans upon entering classrooms and sanctuaries. And we have failed when \nwe fear the next attack that impedes our neighbor's ability to practice \ntheir faith.\n  To the Jewish community of Michigan's 11th District and beyond: I see \nyou, I am here for you, and I will continue to do my part to uproot \nintolerance and hate wherever it grows.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

While Lieutenant Moloney was \non the front line, his wife, Velvet, worked tirelessly treating COVID-\n19 patients as a respiratory therapist and taking care of their two \nyoung children. Both Jason and Velvet served to protect our State and \nsacrifice time at home during the holidays as a family.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Lieutenant Moloney and the entire Southlake \nFire Department for their dedication, bravery, and providing world \nclass service to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam Speaker, I come here with the heaviest \nheart. My beloved Bronx saw the deadliest fire in the history of New \nYork City in more than three decades; a fire that has left a death \ncount of 17 residents, including 8 children.\n  A malfunctioning space heater was the immediate cause of the fire in \na duplex on the third floor of a 19-story building known as Twin Parks \nNorth West. And even though the fire was largely limited to the third \nfloor, both the apartment door and the nearby stairwell door were left \nopen, causing the smoke to spread rapidly and widely throughout the 19-\nstory building.\n  Since the building has no fire escapes and since the stairwells were \nfull of black, toxic smoke, the tenants had no means of escape. The \nsmoke spread so widely that victims were found on every floor. The \nfatalities were tenants who died from severe smoke inhalation from \ncardiac and respiratory arrest.\n  Almost all of the victims came from a single town in Gambia. The \nGambian community has had roots in Twin Parks North West that date back \nmore than half a century. It is hard to imagine a more closely knit \ncommunity, a community more tied by the bonds of faith and family and \nfellowship than the Gambian community of Twin Parks North West, and so \nthe loss is deeply felt.\n  The victims were as young as 2, and no older than 50. These were \nvictims who had their whole lives ahead of them. Ousmane Konteh was \nonly 2 years old.\n  Muhammed Drammeh celebrated his twelfth birthday.\n  Sera Janneh was a student at Lehman College. She had dreams of \nbecoming a social worker of aiding those afflicted by trauma.\n  My heart aches for the father who lost his wife, two daughters, and a \nson; for the mother who lost her toddler; for the children who lost \ntheir parents; for the Drammeh family who lost four members; and the \nDukureh family who lost five.\n  The fire at Twin Parks North West was as preventable as it was \ntragic. If the space heater had shut off automatically, the fire would \nhave been prevented.\n  If the apartment door and the stairwell doors had closed \nautomatically, the spread of the smoke would have been contained and \ncountless lives would have been saved.\n  If the building had a sprinkler system, the fire would have been \nextinguished.\n  If the building had a two-way intercom system, the tenants would have \nbeen advised by the fire department to remain in their homes instead of \nfleeing to a smoke-filled stairwell that had become a death trap.\n  And if the tenants had sufficient heat and hot water in their homes, \nthere would have been no need to use dangerous space heaters in the \nfirst place.\n  The use of space heaters is often a cry for help and a cry for heat. \nIt is often an act of desperation for decent and dignified housing.\n  Madam Speaker, the Bronx is no stranger to deadly fires. New York \nCity's four worst fires in the past 30 years have all been in the \nBronx, have all been in my district of south Bronx.\n  The prevalence of deadly fires in south Bronx is no accident. It is a \nconsequence of systemic disinvestment from the lowest income \ncommunities of color, from places like the south Bronx, from the safety \nand quality of affordable housing.\n  When it comes to fire safety, America is a tale of two countries and \nNew York is a tale of two cities. If you live in a luxury development \nin Manhattan, then fire safety can be taken for granted. But if you \nlive in an affordable housing complex in the south Bronx, there is no \nguarantee that your building will have a sprinkler system; in fact, it \nis unlikely to have one.\n  There is no guarantee that your building will have self-closing \ndoors. There is no guarantee that your building will have what experts \nwould consider anything resembling modern standards of fire safety.\n  In America, poor people of color are left to live in conditions that \nput them at greater risk of losing everything, including their own \nhomes, their own families, their own lives from a catastrophic fire.\n  If that is not cruel and callous, I am not sure what would be. We are \nreminded that safe and decent affordable housing is not a privilege but \na right; not a luxury but a moral necessity; not an abstraction but a \nmatter of life and death. Building back better should and must mean \nbuilding back safer for communities long forgotten.\n  On January 9, the world bore witness to one of the fire department's \nfinest hours of public service. It took the Herculean efforts of more \nthan 200 firefighters to extinguish the fires at Twin Parks North West. \nFirefighters who had ran out of oxygen in their tanks ran into burning \nbuildings, saving lives at great risk to their own.\n\n[[Page H247]]\n\n  There are no words that can convey more powerfully the heroism shown \nthan the image beside me; the image of Matt Zimpfer, a proud member of \nthe FDNY carrying a baby, a visibly traumatized baby that he had \nrescued from the fire at Twin Parks North West. It is as much an image \nof our common humanity as it is of the FDNY's uncommon bravery.\n  For the south Bronx, January 9 is a day that will live in infamy, but \nthe image beside me reminds me that even in a moment of despair, there \nwas cause for hope. Even in a moment of tragedy and a day of infamy, \nheroes can and do emerge.\n  The overwhelming sense of sorrow that weighs so heavily on my heart \nis rivaled only by the overwhelming gratitude that I feel for our \nheroes at the FDNY, a gratitude that will remain with me for as long as \nI live.\n  May God bless the heroic souls of the FDNY, New York City's bravest, \nand may God bless the resilient and resourceful souls of the Gambian \ncommunity of Twin Parks North West.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 4, 2021, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, we may be starting a new \nyear, but so far the problems remain the same. This week marks the 1-\nyear anniversary of Joe Biden being sworn in as President of the United \nStates, and, of course, also the 1-year anniversary of one-party, far-\nleft Democrat rule in Washington.\n  This past year was one of unprecedented crises as a direct result. \nThe American people face an economic crisis, an energy crisis, a border \ncrisis, an education crisis, a crime crisis, a COVID-19 crisis, and a \nnational security crisis as a direct result of Joe Biden and \ncongressional Democrats' failed leadership and their far-left socialist \nagenda.\n  In this hour, a cross-section of my Republican colleagues will \naddress and highlight these issues as we stand for the opposite \npolicies, and we are very anxious to be returned to the majority so \nthat we can solve these ongoing dilemmas.\n  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend right \nacross the Sabine River, for yielding.\n  No President has ever had a worse first year in office than Joe \nBiden.\n  And sadly, his deteriorating 42 percent approval rating perfectly \nmirrors the deteriorating state of our country.\n  We are facing crises on nearly every front, and our Commander in \nChief who, by the way, is responsible for creating each and every one \nof these crises, is doing absolutely nothing to stop them.\n  However, the most threatening of these concerns is still the \nunmitigated disaster that is raging on our southern border.\n  More than 1.7 million illegal alien apprehensions happened under \nBiden's watch last year, and those were just the ones that we caught.\n  Instead of securing our borders, this administration spent all of \n2021 sweeping the rule of law under the rug and using the cover of \ndarkness to fly thousands of unvetted and untested for COVID illegal \naliens across the country to be released into our neighborhoods.\n  How many more innocent women and children need to be assaulted, \nraped, and trafficked?\n  How many more Americans need to overdose on Chinese fentanyl that is \nbeing smuggled across the border?\n  How many more terrorists need to be caught trying to infiltrate our \nNation?\n  What level of threat do we need to reach to finally garner some \naction from this President?\n  Americans are tired of paying for this administration's ignorance and \npolitical games.\n  This is a new year, Mr. President. Use it wisely.\n  It is past time that you live up to the oath that you swore.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, there are so many crises it \nis hard for us to keep count.\n  I yield to my dear friend from the State of Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  This week, our Nation is marking a solemn anniversary, 49 years since \nthe deadly Roe v. Wade decision.\n  For nearly half a century, pro-life Americans have been standing \nstrong to defend precious human life and the most vulnerable among us.\n  Right now we are facing some tough challenges. Under the current one-\nparty rule in Washington, Americans are witnessing unprecedented \nattacks on pro-life protections across the country.\n  Time and time again, I have come to this floor to oppose Democrats' \nradical antilife agenda.\n  As many times as it takes, I will stand here to reject the attacks on \nlife, and I will vote ``no'' on taxpayer-funded services, including the \nwicked proposal to permit abortion on demand at any time bankrolled by \nthe American people.\n  These are dark days in this country.\n  At the same time we have so much to be happy and hopeful for as we \nlook at this new year.\n  The Supreme Court, including my fellow Hoosier, Justice Amy Coney \nBarrett, is currently considering the most significant challenge to Roe \nv. Wade since 1973.\n  This could be the final anniversary that we mark under Roe v. Wade.\n  For five decades, we have been in a long battle against abortion, and \nthis is the time to restore the dignity of life and protect life once \nand for all.\n  As a pro-life lawmaker, I am proud to stand alongside millions of \nAmericans in Indiana and across the country who believe in the inherent \nvalue of life.\n  Our enduring commitment to life and the truth will prevail.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman is right, \nthe sanctity of human life is one of the central principles that this \ncountry is founded upon, and it does get darkest before the dawn. There \nis hope on the horizon.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van \nDrew).\n  Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nthank him for his leadership.\n  The President's most important job is to lead, to lead and protect \nour country. Yet time and again, all we have seen from President Biden \nis a failure to lead.\n  Biden's handling of Afghanistan led to the death of 13 American \nservicemembers and left hundreds more abandoned. This was a failure to \nlead.\n  Biden's handling of the border has been a disaster with more than two \nmillion illegal immigrants being apprehended at our border. This was a \nfailure to lead.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Biden failed to shut down COVID-19 and has allowed more Americans to \ndie from this disease, despite widespread access to vaccines. This was \na failure to lead.\n  Inflation is at a 40-year high; supply chains are crippled; and labor \nshortages have hindered an economic recovery. This has been a failure \nto lead.\n  Soft-on-crime policy has resulted in 16 of America's largest cities \nsuffering from new highs in homicide rates and a 115 percent increase \nin attacks against our law enforcement officials, all while President \nBiden and House Democrats demand to defund our police. This has been a \nfailure to lead.\n  This is not the America I know. The America I know is strong, and it \ndeserves a strong leader, not the worst President in our history, not \none that continues time and again to fail to lead.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Those \nare not just Republican talking points. Politico had a story this \nmorning. They asked Americans in a nationwide poll to give the \nPresident a letter grade, and 37 percent of Americans gave him an F--85 \npercent or more of Republicans, but also, they say, an alarming number \nof Democrats gave a D or an F grade.\n  So the gentleman is exactly right. It is a failure. An F-minus, says \nMr. Van Drew.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend from the State of Tennessee \n(Mr. Burchett).\n  Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. It is the great \nState of Tennessee.\n  Madam Speaker, for the last year, Joe Biden and the Democrats have \ncompletely controlled our government in Washington. Their first order \nof business when they took power was to ram through Congress almost $2 \ntrillion in Federal spending under the so-called American Rescue Plan.\n  When this bill became law last March, Democrats said it was necessary \nto fight the coronavirus. Ten months later, our country is still \ndealing with the same problems Democrats claimed their bill would \nsolve.\n  COVID tests are sold out at drugstores, and testing centers have\n\n[[Page H241]]\n\nhourlong lines. Not even Kamala Harris can give a straight answer about \nwhen Americans will receive at-home test kits. Is it this week? Is it \nnext week? Is it sometime in the future? I don't think she knows.\n  We have overwhelmed hospitals that are struggling to treat patients \ndue to staffing shortages. Corrupt teachers' unions are forcing \nstudents out of the classroom and bullying parents. Businesses of all \nsizes and across industries cannot find enough workers to keep up with \nthe demand.\n  Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan failed miserably to address \nor prevent these issues. That is because it mostly focused on funding \nliberal special interests instead of targeted pandemic relief.\n  This whole debacle confirmed two things: Congress cannot spend its \nway out of a problem, and Democrats will always use a crisis to advance \ntheir political agenda.\n  Joe Biden promised to shut down the coronavirus when he took office. \nOne year later, all he shut down were America's hospitals and \nbusinesses.\n  Thank you, Vice Chairman Johnson, for your adequate and more-than-\nlackluster leadership skills.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nkeeping me humble.\n  Madam Speaker, we have just come straight to the floor from a Members \nand media roundtable on the border and crime crises, and he led that so \nably. I am delighted to hear what he has to say in his 2 minutes.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas \n(Mr. Pfluger).\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for \nyielding.\n  Madam Speaker, it is hard to pick the crisis to talk about because \nthere are so many. I would like to talk about unity.\n  I was at the inauguration last year. I heard the President's speech. \nI heard him campaign. His message was centered on restoring unity to an \nangry Nation. He promised to bring us together.\n  Well, he has brought the American people together, that is for sure, \nbecause everyone now understands the full magnitude of the crises that \nwe are going through. He has united the country in that fact alone.\n  One year ago, I want everyone to remember, we were not experiencing \nthe inflation that we are, the highest rate in 40 years. We did not \nhave foreign adversaries who were treading over our policies and \nlooking at us as weak.\n  Right now, we have a border that is in complete chaos and complete \ncrisis. It has only been 1 year under President Biden's reign, and our \nNation is directionless from the masthead in the midst of chaos, not to \nmention that our international reputation and our influence have been \nsquandered through policy failure after policy failure.\n  When you look at this poster right here, look at the energy crisis \nthat we are dealing with, and Ukraine right now is in the midst of not \nknowing whether or not they are going to be invaded by the Russians. \nWhat a terrible position to be in.\n  The President has green-lighted Nord Stream. He failed to sanction \nthe Nord Stream pipeline. The energy crisis that is going on in Eastern \nEurope right now, the fact that we are not strong around the world in \nour messaging to deter our enemies and to help our allies, is directly \nleading to this issue that we see in Ukraine right now. And do you know \nwho is watching? China. China is watching this, and they are wondering \nwhether or not Taiwan is going to be next.\n  We have to get back to a strong, firm understanding of law and order, \nthe same discussion that we just had on the border crisis. We have to \nreassert our leadership to make sure that our country, the greatest \nNation that this world has ever known, will choose to follow law and \norder.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that \nkeen insight that he gained faithfully serving our country in the \nmilitary. I thank him for his service.\n\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), \nanother gentleman who has served us so well on the front lines of law \nenforcement before he got to Congress.\n  Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I could speak for hours about this \nadministration's multiple failures over the last year, but I only have \na couple of minutes, so I will cover just inflation, one of them.\n  Since Joe Biden took office, inflation has risen every single month. \nAmericans are paying more for just about everything while earning less \nin every paycheck.\n  This is not sustainable, and it didn't have to be this way. This \nadministration is so out of touch with the average American that \ndespite inflation reaching a 40-year high, they are still pushing for \nmore reckless spending that will only make this crisis worse.\n  American families are paying substantially more for everyday \nproducts, from gasoline to groceries and to energy for heating their \nhomes this winter, to heat their homes in northern Minnesota when it is \n30-below for a week straight.\n  Make no mistake, inflation is a tax on us all, especially our working \nclass and those on fixed incomes. It is no secret that we live in a \nvery polarized nation right now, but there is one thing a strong \nmajority of Americans agree on: Joe Biden's first year in office has \nbeen disastrous to the American people. We deserve better.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman \nfrom Utah (Mr. Owens).\n  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Louisiana for \nhis great leadership.\n  Madam Speaker, over the past year, I spent time throughout Utah's \nFourth District. I have heard from Utahns from all walks of life, and \nmonth after month, they have shared the same concerns: soaring \ninflation, skyrocketing prices, and decreasing wages.\n  That is no surprise because gas is up 49.6 percent. Used cars are up \n37.3 percent. Gas utilities are up 24.1 percent. Meat, fish, and eggs \nare up 12.5 percent. Electricity is up 6.3 percent.\n  On top of this, as real wages have decreased 8 out of the last 11 \nmonths, our economy is still missing millions of prepandemic jobs, and \nemployers are continuing to struggle with persistent labor shortages.\n  What is this administration doing to help? You can't make this up: \ndismissing inflation as high-class problems and transitory; adding to \nthe national debt with money we don't have on programs we don't need; \nand, just last week, advocating to nuke a filibuster the President \ndefended for decades to push through a radical Federal takeover of all \nelections.\n  Our economy should be thriving right now, but inaction, on purpose, \nby this administration has massively increased our national debt, which \nstill sits at $29 trillion, by the way; stifled growth; and financially \ncrippled American families and small businesses.\n  We are closing out the first year of Biden's Presidency with the \nworst inflation of 40 years; open borders; emboldened adversaries; a \nbotched withdrawal from Afghanistan; and a repeated push to increase \nthe size, scope, and reach of the Federal Government.\n  This year, I encourage President Biden to start paying attention to \nthe real needs of real Americans. Maybe then we will start seeing real \nresults.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. So well \nsaid, as always. I think one of the key words you said was purposeful. \nThese crises are not happenstance. These are direct results of policy \nchoices.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nGrothman), my good friend.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, so many areas to pick from in which we \ntalk about the first year of this administration.\n  No country can exist if you don't have immigration laws, and I can't \nthink of anywhere where the new administration is more of a change from \nthe old.\n  We have gone through a situation in which about 25,000 people every \nyear crossed our southern border, and now routinely over 75,000, \ntripling the amount of people who have come across our border.\n  That has received a lot of attention, but not enough attention has \nbeen received for the lack of people being pushed back across the \nborder if they are caught here breaking crimes or otherwise.\n  In the first 6 months of 2020, about 93,000 people were kicked out. \nThis\n\n[[Page H242]]\n\ntime around, it is about 18,000. So we have about another 70,000 people \nwho we don't want in this country, primarily because they have broken \nthe law. Under the Biden administration, we don't kick them out.\n  We have to also look at the carrot that they are giving people to \ncome here in the Build Back Better bill, trying to give free college \neducation to people who come here illegally. Every Democrat but one in \nthis body voted for it, saying: Yes, absolutely. We not only want \npeople to come here illegally, but we will give them free college \neducation, free medical care.\n  Unbelievable.\n  Showing that the number one priority is to get people here illegally, \nthey are not even giving tests for COVID, which says something or \nother. I mean, on the one hand, it is important that everybody even get \na shot if they are hanging around Washington, D.C., but if you are \ncoming across the southern border, we don't care. Unbelievable.\n  Quite a change in America compared to what it used to be, and it is \ngoing to take a lot of work when we get a new President to undo the \nhuge amount of damage that has been done to the fabric of this country \nin the first 12 months of Joe Biden.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. It is so \nwell said. It is as if they are incentivizing lawlessness. That is \nexactly what we are seeing, and everybody knows it.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa), my friend.\n\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Johnson. I \nappreciate this Special Order.\n  Of course, this week does mark the first year of the Biden \nadministration. Unfortunately, it was one of unprecedented crisis. \nIndeed, it is a target-rich environment for us to talk about here \ntonight.\n  Democrats have controlled the executive branch and both Chambers of \nCongress, allowing them to pass, so far, $2 trillion out of their $9 \ntrillion plans. This act has also caused the highest inflation in \ndecades, hitting the middle-class and lower income class hardest in \nthis country.\n  This year, under Democrat leadership, Americans are paying more for \njust about everything, from housing, clothes, food, and gas--especially \nin energy. On the way to the airport in California, it was $5-plus, \n$5.39 at one place. Incredible.\n  In the dead of winter, people are seeing the cost of heating their \nhomes skyrocket. When you stop all sorts of development of energy in \nthis country, you are not going to have the supply. That sends a signal \nto the whole market to raise prices, including the Biden administration \ntelling OPEC overseas to go ahead and send us more while cutting off \nour own pipelines and further development on Federal lands. This, of \ncourse, ripples through everything else in costs.\n  In my real life as a farmer, we are going to see our costs of \nenergy--whether it is diesel fuel, gasoline, fertilizer--skyrocket. \nThat is either going to have to be passed along to the consumer at the \nstore or farmers go broke in this country. Small business owners face \nthe same thing.\n  Everything is going up--more in costs, vaccine mandates, less \nemployees. I mean, I wish we could paint a brighter picture and not \nhave it appear to be a partisan one. It really isn't partisan. It is \nabout having success as a country.\n  Unfortunately, the Biden administration doesn't seem to have a clue \nwhat that success would look like. Indeed, they are chasing their own \nmandates, putting us in a terrible position as a people and for the \neconomy going forward. They need to change their thinking, or the \nvoters need to change them out.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. It is not \npartisanship. We are sharing the facts. He is exactly right.\n  I would encourage my colleagues--there are so many who want to speak, \nand it is a target-rich environment with so many crises. We are going \nto try to stick to 2 minutes on these yields.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. \nHartzler).\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, tomorrow will mark 1 year since President Biden's \ninauguration, and Americans are left asking: Are we better off under \nthis administration?\n  Judging by his all-time low approval ratings, the answer for \nAmericans is a resounding no. Everywhere you look, there is a crisis \nriddled with incompetence, division, and dysfunction.\n  At our southern border, Biden has allowed nearly 2 million illegal \nimmigrants to enter our Nation, creating the worst border crisis in 30 \nyears.\n  In the classroom, Biden has targeted parents and their role in \neducation. His administration even lobbied for them to be called \ndomestic terrorists.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Madam Speaker, in our communities violent crime is at all-time highs. \nLast year, the murder rate was higher than at any point since 1996.\n  On the economy, Biden's mishandling of our Federal Government has \ncreated the highest inflation rate in 40 years. Bare shelves, high gas \nprices, and supply chain issues continue to dog this administration.\n  On the world stage, Biden botched our withdrawal from Afghanistan, \nsurrendering to the Taliban and making America a laughingstock to our \nadversaries. All of this resulted in the deaths of 13 servicemembers, \nincluding one from my home State of Missouri.\n  Instead of addressing these issues, President Biden had doubled down \non his far-left socialist policies, out-of-control spending, and \nincompetence. It is past time for a change. America deserves better. \nThey need leadership that listens and fights for hardworking families, \nnot against them.\n  Madam Speaker, I am proud to help lead the fight alongside my fellow \nRepublicans to reverse course by unleashing our economy, securing our \nborder, respecting parents, defending life and our foundational values, \nand providing for the common defense.\n  On this one-year anniversary commemorating the misery of the Biden \nadministration, we commit ourselves to never stop fighting for what is \nright, to work harder than ever, and to never give up. America is \ndepending on us.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Clyde), home of the new national championship \nfootball team.\n  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of \nPresident Biden's inauguration. Many Americans have now endured 365 \ndays of an absent administration, 52 weeks of policy failures, 12 \nmonths of utter turmoil, and a year of constant, crippling crises.\n  Earlier today a Rasmussen Poll revealed that 60 percent of the \ncountry considers the President's first year in office unsuccessful. \nFifty percent said it was very unsuccessful, with one third of \nDemocrats believing Biden's first year was a failure. All of this has \ncontributed to his abysmal 33 percent rating, the lowest since Jimmy \nCarter.\n  Madam Speaker, in all sincerity, I didn't imagine this much damage \ncould be done in just one year, but here we are, facing an economic \ncrisis with hyperinflation, a supply chain crisis, a labor shortage \ncrisis, a border crisis, a national security crisis, an energy crisis \nwith incredible gas prices, an education crisis, a COVID crisis, a \ncrime crisis, and an election integrity crisis with Democrats trying to \npush through election reforms that would federalize our election and \neliminate voter ID. Ultimately, these all stem from a leadership crisis \nin the White House, a leadership crisis that has caused Americans \nunnecessary hardship.\n  Madam Speaker, as we enter the second year of the Biden \nadministration's rule, the President has an important decision to make. \nWill he continue to sidestep from the crises he has created, destined \nto inflict more destruction? Or will he confront these crises head-on \nand implement successful solutions?\n  Mr. President, the American people demand successful solutions. They \ndeserve successful solutions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).\n  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, President Biden ran his campaign on a \nmessage of unity. Since day one of his administration, he has been \ndefined by the divisive policies that are the wrong\n\n[[Page H243]]\n\napproach for Tennessee families and workers.\n  In 2021, we saw cartels take control of our southern border. We saw \nthe worst inflation in decades. We saw Afghanistan fall into the hands \nof terrorists as we hastily and incompetently withdrew our forces from \nthe country, leaving billions of dollars of modern military equipment \nand hundreds of Americans and Afghan allies behind. Finally, we saw \nabusive government overreach in the form of vaccine mandates taken to \nnew heights.\n  With President Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of \nCongress, Americans know 2022 will be no better. According to a recent \nMomentive Poll, more than half of Americans are more fearful than \nhopeful about what 2022 has in store for them and with good reason.\n  Just take a glimpse at the state of our economy. The Consumer Price \nIndex rose 7 percent in December, the highest rate seen since 1982. \nThis comes on the heels of President Biden's reckless spending agenda \nand senseless policies that have created a labor shortage; led to a \ndecline in real, personal income; raised costs of consumer goods, gas, \nand home heating costs; and contributed to the supply chain disruptions \nthat are causing drastic shortages and bare shelves across America.\n  Madam Speaker, this is President Joe Biden's version of America. It \nis costing Tennesseans more each day. President Biden can try to talk \naround it. He often refuses to talk about it at all. The reality \nremains the same. His administration's policies have been devastating \nto this Nation. More than ever, Americans want America-first \nleadership.\n  Madam Speaker, as we begin the first days of 2022, I remain steadfast \nin my commitment to focus on the needs of the good folks of Tennessee \nwho I represent, not the whims of the permanent class of political \nelites in Washington D.C.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), another seasoned, very \neffective legislator.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, this has been a year of crisis under \nthe leadership of President Joe Biden. At the southern border, our \ncountry was noticeably lacking leadership and solutions from the White \nHouse. Instead, President Biden took regressive actions. He halted \nconstruction on the border wall, brought back catch and release, and \ngot rid of the remain in Mexico policy.\n  Because of these decisions, over 1.7 million illegal immigrants have \nbeen encountered at the southern border since President Biden took \noffice. The number of illegal crossings at the border has risen at a \nrate faster under President Biden than at any other time in recent \nhistory. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that fentanyl \nseizures increased 134 percent in fiscal year 2021.\n\n  I saw this crisis firsthand when I visited the southern border with \nmy colleagues, and I have led and supported legislative solutions in \nCongress to combat this crisis. It is disheartening and unacceptable \nthat President Biden has neither visited the border to witness the \ncrisis, nor has he proposed solutions to control the unmanageable \nlevels of border crossings and fentanyl trafficking. To say President \nBiden has under-delivered to the American people is beyond an \nunderstatement.\n  Madam Speaker, I say it again. This year has been a year of crisis \nunder the leadership of President Biden.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez), who we refer to as ``The Chief.''\n  Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, life has been hard for the American \npeople as President Biden concludes his first year in office. \nUnfortunately, too many in this Chamber have bowed down to the most \nradical fringes of the Democratic Party.\n  The sad reality today is liberals in Congress have no clue what every \nday, hardworking Americans are going through. They care more about \npushing their radical agenda than helping working families. The result \nis more inflation, higher gas prices, unconstitutional vaccine \nmandates, broken supply chains, and Americans struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  On our side of the aisle, Republicans are committed to making sure we \nget the American people back to work, ensuring that small businesses \ncan find employees to help keep their businesses open, making sure \nAmericans have uninterrupted access to goods, and getting our country \nroaring back with a strong economy and safe communities. Those are the \nissues that Americans really care about.\n  Here in Washington, Republicans will use our congressional authority \nto hold the Biden administration accountable for the Afghanistan \ndebacle where we don't know how many Americans are still left behind in \nAfghanistan, for choosing to wreck our energy sector, handing Putin the \nNord Stream 2 pipeline, and for allowing the southern borders to be \nkept wide open. Where once we were energy independent a year ago, now \nwe are begging OPEC to please produce more.\n  Madam Speaker, after only a year of the Biden administration and his \nradical governing of our country, we have had enough. The American \npeople have had enough. Our people, our country deserve better.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Obernolte).\n  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, several days ago the Department of \nLabor released statistics on job creation and inflation in the United \nStates. This data should be deeply alarming to every American.\n  This country, over the last year, has dumped trillions of dollars of \nexcess Federal spending into our economy. At the time economists warned \nus that doing so was dangerously inflationary. Unfortunately, those \nfears have come to fruition.\n  The statistics for the month of December show inflation at nearly 7 \npercent on an annualized basis. That is the highest rate of inflation \nin nearly 40 years. When inflation is caused through government action, \nas this round of inflation clearly is, it represents an unseen tax that \nis paid by every American because it raises the prices of everything \nthat we buy.\n  Equally alarming is the fact that real wage growth has not kept up \nwith inflation. In fact, the Department of Labor says that for all of \nlast year real wage growth was negative nearly 2\\1/2\\ percent. If we \ndon't correct this trend, it is going to result in an entire generation \nof Americans being driven toward poverty because their wages are not \nkeeping up with the prices that they pay for the goods that they need \nto survive.\n  Madam Speaker, we need to get our fiscal house in order and correct \nthis runaway Federal spending before our children suffer the \nconsequences.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).\n  Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, this administration's failed policies have \nled to record inflation and empty store shelves across the country. \nInflation just reached the highest level in 40 years. At the same time \nbasic goods are harder and harder to find at the stores thanks to the \nsupply chain mess.\n  Every day we see a new story about things getting more expensive, \nlife getting harder for Americans. Hardworking families are sick and \ntired of paying more and getting less.\n  Madam Speaker, I have produced three bills that would help fix the \nsupply chain crisis and ensure goods make it to the stores and \nconsumers. These issues are urgent, but there has been no movement on \nthese bills. Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington continue to spend more \nas paychecks get smaller and costs continue to rise.\n  Madam Speaker, I will continue to fight against these bad policies \nand push for solutions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).\n  Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, as America marks a year since President \nBiden's inauguration, Republicans are focused on delivering solutions \nto the multitude of crises his administration has created.\n  After a year of one-party rule, the reality is American families are \nseeing empty shelves at the grocery store. Businesses cannot find \nworkers. Inflation just hit the highest rate in 40 years. Meanwhile, \nthe catastrophe at our southern border continues to worsen. In the past \n12 months, more than\n\n[[Page H244]]\n\n1.7 million people have been caught trying to enter the United States \nillegally.\n  Madam Speaker, the Biden administration can ignore these inconvenient \ntruths all they want. Do you know who is noticing? The American people \nare noticing. These are the same people who are working every day, the \npeople driving our economy forward in spite of President Biden stacking \nthe odds against them.\n  Madam Speaker, be assured when Republicans regain the majority in the \nHouse, we will continue tackling these challenges by getting government \nout of the way, restoring our God-given freedoms, and ensuring \nAmericans keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), one of the true border states \nthat sees all of these crises firsthand.\n  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, well, it has been one year since President \nBiden and the Democrats have had complete control of running our \ncountry.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  They have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency.\n  And what have they accomplished in this 1 year?\n  Inflation has gone through the roof--a 40-year high. Gas prices are \nup. Grocery prices are up. The utilities costs have gone up. The border \nis wide-open with sex trafficking, human trafficking, and fentanyl \nflooding across our border.\n  COVID deaths are higher than they have ever been before.\n  Madam Speaker, do you know those long lines that you see of Americans \nwaiting in line for COVID tests?\n  Well, guess what, Madam Speaker?\n  The Biden administration diverted over $2 billion that was meant for \nthose testing of COVID and for medical supplies and diverted it to \nhouse illegal immigrants.\n  Don't be surprised or mistaken, but it is the Democrat policies that \nhave caused these problems.\n  And what are the Democrats doing now while the country is going down \nthe tubes?\n  They are pushing election laws, election laws where they want to rig \nelections to their favor and fund their own elections. This is \ninsanity.\n  I hope my Democratic colleagues will work together with us to solve \nthe problems that are facing Americans today.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for her so \nwell-said remarks.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas, (Mr. Mann).\n  Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana \nfor hosting this today. There are a lot of things to talk about for a \nyear. We could talk about immigration. We could talk about inflation. \nWe could talk about crime. And we could talk about Afghanistan. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  But I want to talk for a little bit today about trade and \nspecifically our relationship with China.\n  I rise today to call the Biden administration to action regarding our \ntrade partnership, or lack thereof, with China.\n  China has proven to be a bad faith negotiator, and they are using the \nUnited States as a doormat. Our country made a deal with China 2 years \nago on January 15, 2020, and China has failed to live up to their end \nof the bargain by a long shot. As part of this deal, China committed to \nimporting $36 billion of U.S. agriculture products in 2020 and 2021 \ncombined, but they have fallen short by nearly $7 billion. China sold \nAmerican farmers a bill of goods, and the Biden administration has made \nno effort to rectify this egregious situation.\n  Now that phase one is expiring, farmers and ranchers are frustrated \nto say the least. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, in a feeble effort to \nreassure us, said:\n\n       Ambassador Tai, our U.S. Trade Representative, continues to \n     converse with China about the necessity of living up totally \n     and completely to the phase one trade agreement, making up \n     their deficit over the course of the next several years.\n\n  This is completely unacceptable. The next several years was never \npart of this deal, which is not a complex one. China said that they \nwould purchase a certain amount of agricultural goods, and they have \nfallen short by a margin that suggests that they never intended to live \nup to their end of the deal in the first place.\n  Again, we have not seen any effort from this administration on behalf \nof farmers, which is why I am standing here today to state the \nobvious--the United States must either force China to comply with their \nend of the agreement or punish them for failing to do so. That is how \ndeals work. At the very least, we need to see this administration \ndeveloping a new, comprehensive, realistic deal to collect the deficit. \nThe time for conversations already took place long before the deal was \nsigned January 15, 2020, when China signed the deal.\n  This administration at year end needs to step up and defend our \nfarmers, our ranchers, and our country from being financially \nmanipulated by China--yet another unnecessary crisis.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nthat plain talk from Kansas.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who \nis one of the brightest and most respected Members of Congress.\n  Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, if the Biden administration were a new TV \nshow streaming on Netflix or HBO, it clearly would have been canceled \nafter the end of the first season.\n  On this anniversary of Mr. Biden's failed first year, I call \nattention to the crisis at the Southwest border, a crisis which \nPresident Biden and the Democrats have continuously chosen to turn a \nblind eye to. In just 1 year, over 1.7 million illegal immigrants have \nbeen apprehended at the border--an all-time high.\n  President Trump spent 4 years fighting to secure our border by \nenacting policies to keep Americans--especially in our communities \nalong the border--safe. After less than a month in office, President \nBiden revoked the Trump-era border policies and replaced them, Madam \nSpeaker, with what?\n  Absolutely nothing.\n  In April, 3 months after Joe Biden took office and 2 months after \nthese policies were rescinded, I made my seventh trip to the Southwest \nborder. During that visit, I witnessed the most unstable conditions \nthat I have seen since coming to Congress. I immediately called on \nPresident Biden then to reinstate the Trump-era policies that were \nworking along our border.\n  Finally, just a few weeks ago in December, it was announced that \nPresident Biden planned to re-implement President Trump's Remain in \nMexico policy. But, Madam Speaker, we need action, not talk. President \nBiden should visit the border and talk to the communities there. \nPresident Biden should fire his Homeland Security Secretary who is not \ngetting the job done.\n  So in this first failed year, President Biden has neglected our \nSouthwest border. That neglect is evident with deteriorating \nconditions, apprehensions at an all-time high, and record amounts of \nillegal drugs pouring across our open border and poisoning \nour families.\n\n  Americans deserve better. Americans deserve a secure border, and \nAmericans deserve leadership.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, Americans do deserve so much \nbetter.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).\n  Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for \nyielding.\n  Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, I joined several of my colleagues--\nespecially the freshman Republican colleagues--in a letter to President \nBiden showing our willingness to work with him on behalf of the \nAmerican people and to bridge the partisan gridlock, because our \nPresident's success is our Nation's success.\n  While I am proud that 1 year later I have been able to get 12 \nbipartisan bills out of the House and four signed into law, I am \ndisappointed that the policies from the Biden administration encourage \nmore division, more Federal spending, and more crises hurting American \nworkers, families, and small businesses as we continue through the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n  Inflation is at a 40-year high, driving up prices everywhere from the \ngrocery store to prices at the gas pump. We have record high numbers of \nmigrants and illicit drugs at our southern border\n\n[[Page H245]]\n\nstraining our resources and empowering drug cartels. Our disastrous \nwithdrawal from Afghanistan resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. \nservicemembers, and we still have left the lives of Americans and our \nallies and military arsenal in the hands of the Taliban.\n  In the latest edition of partisan politics last week, one of my \nbipartisan bills was taken over and instead became over 700 pages of \nnationalizing elections and letting public funds be used for political \ncampaigns.\n  I will keep working through this gridlock, sticking to my \nconservative policies and principles and fighting back against Big \nGovernment and big spending policies.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank the gentlewoman for her principled \nleadership. It has been effective, and we are grateful she is here.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr. \nWeber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, tomorrow, January 20, 2022, is a \nday that will live in infamy and marks 1 year since Joe Biden was sworn \nin as President.\n  I remember saying: This is the most important election of our \nlifetime.\n  Unfortunately, I was right.\n  In 1 year--under one-party rule and in just 1 year--it has been one \nhuge, continuing debacle and crisis.\n  We went from energy independence to energy crisis, Madam Speaker; \nfrom a rebounding economy to the highest inflation in 40 years; from \ninternational peace through strength to increased tensions with our \ngreatest adversaries; and might I add, losing the confidence of our \nallies.\n  We went, Madam Speaker, from border security to 2 million illegal \nalien crossings; from the end of the pandemic to the never-ending \npandemic, particularly with unconstitutional mandates.\n  What is the cause?\n  One Democrat disaster after another, and Americans are losing faith \nnot only with the performance of the current administration, but also \nwith our governmental agencies: the FBI, the DOJ, and the CDC. You name \nit. The list is endless.\n  Democrats are showing who they are: Socialists, police defunders, \nopen border advocates, and anti-parents who just want a say in their \nchild's schooling. Is that too much to ask?\n  That is what Democrats are. This is their brand, and that Democrat \nbrand, I might add, is a disaster. We Republicans need to point it out \nevery day in every way.\n  So to my Republican colleagues I say, let's go brand `em.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Brand `em. I like it.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. \nMiller), who is another very effective legislator.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the Congressman for \nhosting this Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, Americans have experienced whiplash this past year as \nthe Biden administration has spun us from the America first agenda to \nAmerica last.\n  We watched in horror as the Taliban released thousands of al-Qaida, \nISIS, and Taliban prisoners from the prison at Bagram Air Base. Our \nservicemembers bravely sacrificed to capture those terrorists, and the \nBiden administration allowed them to be released. One of the ISIS-K \nprisoners led the bombing that killed our 13 servicemembers.\n  Biden's failure in Afghanistan led to the surrender of tens of \nbillions of dollars in U.S. military equipment to the Taliban. Military \nequipment paid for by U.S. taxpayers will now be used against America \nbecause of President Biden. As Afghanistan fell, President Biden \ndisappeared, first to Camp David and then to Delaware.\n  His Cabinet refused to brief the American people directly and instead \nsent spokesmen. Additionally, the Defense Secretary refused to testify \nbefore Congress.\n  The Biden administration then flew an estimated 78,000 Afghan \nnationals to American soil and then lied to the American people about \nthe vetting process they were using to ensure that no ISIS, al-Qaida, \nor Taliban terrorists were brought to our shores.\n  To this day, no one in the Biden administration has been held \nresponsible for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or for the \nlies that were told to the American people, and no one has been fired \nor resigned.\n  Madam Speaker, who will be fired?\n  Who is resigning?\n  The American people deserve accountability. China, our enemy, has \nwatched all of this unfold; and, sadly, our children and grandchildren \nwill pay the price of Biden's incompetence.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman's remarks \nare well-said.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter). Georgia is the home of the new national \nchampionship football team.\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding and for hosting this Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, Joe Biden's first year in office has exceeded all \nexpectations. In 365 short days, Joe Biden has managed to inflict an \nentire term of pain and hardship on the American people. Grocery store \nshelves are empty. Prices are up 7 percent nationwide. Gas costs $1 \nmore per gallon today than it did when Biden took office. Americans \nlost the equivalent of two paychecks last year, and Biden has failed to \nadd one single job from our 2019 high.\n  Madam Speaker, only one thing has gone down in price during this \nadministration, and that is the price of fentanyl. That is the price of \nfentanyl because of the fentanyl that is coming across the southern \nborder.\n  Washington Democrats were counting on Joe Biden to socialize our \neconomy, and, boy, did he deliver. His administration caved to teachers \nunions, putting the wants of liberal elites ahead of the needs of our \nchildren who are desperate for high quality, in-person learning.\n  Domestic terrorists--that is how this administration labeled parents \nwho want better for their children than virtual learning. It is \ndespicable.\n  He caved to Russia, gutting the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day \nin office but allowing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to push ahead \nvirtually unchecked.\n  He caved to Fauci, who kept his job despite lying to Congress about \ngain-of-function research.\n  Do you know who isn't caving, Madam Speaker?\n  Senator Manchin, the Supreme Court, and Republicans across the Nation \nwho are fed up with this administration's singular focus on stripping \nrights and opportunities away from Americans. This administration has \nmore than earned its 33 percent approval rating, and I hope, for the \nsake of our country, that the next 3 years are nothing like the one we \nhave just endured.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield to the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), one of the smartest and hardest \nworking Members of Congress.\n  Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I know \nthat we have talked a lot about different crises, and we do have a lot \nof different crises. We have an economic crisis. We have an inflation \ncrisis. We have an energy cost crisis. We have a supply chain crisis. \nWe have an education crisis. We have a crime crisis. We have a COVID \nresponse crisis. We have a healthcare crisis. We have a foreign \nrelations and security crisis. We have a freedom of speech crisis. We \nhave a centralized government and infringement on our rights crisis.\n  There is one crisis that is very disturbing and concerning to me as a \nnaturalized American who immigrated to this great country. I went to \nthe border three times, and what I saw was lawlessness; its issue of \nnational security, its anarchy, and it is a crisis that has posed a \nrisk to our sovereignty as a nation.\n  We can see what has happened in the country. Drug cartels are \ncontrolling the border. They control drug trafficking and are making \nbillions from that. We have the highest deaths from overdoses in our \ncountry that ever existed. Our kids are dying, and they are making a \nlot of money. The border is open. No one can control it. It poses risks \nto our national security.\n  I hope for us all as Americans who care about our country, that our \nPresident at least starts dealing with this crisis because it is a \nserious issue, and\n\n[[Page H246]]\n\nwe cannot disregard national security of the greatest country that ever \nexisted on Earth and put our people at risk.\n  It is our responsibility as Representatives for this Republic to \nstand up, regardless of party affiliations, and raise the issues, and \nwe owe a duty to the American people.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nher comments.\n  Madam Speaker, what my colleagues have illustrated here in this \nSpecial Order is the crisis that we have in this country. We are on the \nanniversary now of 1 year of far-left Democratic rule in Washington. We \nhave a unified government. The far-left Democrats are in charge of the \nWhite House and both Houses of Congress. Elections have consequences. \nThe American people can see it for themselves. Every poll across this \ncountry shows us. They know that it is crisis upon crisis upon crisis.\n  You have heard my colleagues illustrate so many of those here this \nafternoon. If we had hours upon hours we could continue all night.\n  The economic crisis last year: Inflation cost the average worker \nnearly two paychecks.\n  An energy crisis: The national average for a gallon of gas rose 49.6 \npercent for the year.\n  A border crisis: Because of the Democrats' open border policies, \nevery State is now a border State.\n  An education crisis: President Biden promised to reopen schools in \nhis first 100 days but his administration secretly worked with \nteachers' unions to keep the schools closed and label parents as \ndomestic terrorists.\n  A crime crisis: Over a dozen U.S. cities had a record-high homicide \nrate in 2021.\n  A COVID crisis: Although President Biden promised to shut down the \nvirus, many Americans continue to struggle to find tests, and, of \ncourse, many schools remain closed because of this.\n  A national security crisis: Because of President Biden's weakness on \nthe world stage, our adversaries in Beijing, Tehran, and Moscow are \nstronger today and they are in power.\n  We could go on and on and on. I am out of time, Madam Speaker, but I \nwill just point out again, the latest poll that was released just this \nmorning didn't look at just numbers. They asked the American people to \ngive a letter grade to the President. Thirty percent of Americans give \nthe President an F, a failing grade, and more Americans give him an F \nthan give him an A or a B. This is a failed Presidency. These are \nfailed policies. We are living under the crises that they have created. \nIt is time for this to come to an end.\n  We are grateful to the American people for recognizing this, and we \nlook forward to bringing our solutions to bear at the election cycle \nthis fall.\n  Madam Speaker, our Special Order hour has concluded, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nSchweikert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, there are so many things we all want \nto talk about and share, and sometimes, as Members of Congress, we run \nin front of microphones and sort of do the shiny, loud object of the \nday because, let's face it, that gets us retweets and Facebook and \nthose things, but they are often trite. So I have a handful of things I \nwant to walk through, but there is going to be a constant theme here.\n  I am not trying to be mean, but the thing is--and my facts will back \nme up--that the Democrat policies, if you look at particularly the last \n12 months, have made life more miserable for Americans, have made the \nworking class and the poor working class poorer and actually are \ncrushing hope.\n  I want to walk through a couple of economic things. I am blessed to \nbe the senior Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. There is a \nhandful of economists that work on our side, and there is a handful \nthat work for left side. We have been digging and digging and digging, \ntrying to understand the inflation data, the amount of cash chasing \ngoods, and what is happening in productivity. I hope I am wrong, but I \nam starting to see numbers that look like we are on the cusp of a wage-\nprice spiral.\n  Let's sort of walk through our basic economics. You all remember your \nhigh school economics class, particularly those of us who are old \nenough to have been in high school at the end of the 1970s. Businesses \nraise prices because their costs are going up. Typically, just like we \nwere doing right now in the new year, people are getting their wage \nhikes. Most of those wage hikes are nothing more than to keep up with \ninflation, so you end up with this spike.\n  There was a handful of folks on the Democrat side that were saying to \nlook at the December number; it wasn't spiking as much as the previous \nmonths. Wait till you see the January numbers when the wages come in, \nand then you end up with this world saying now businesses, \norganizations, government, others, have to keep raising their costs, \nraising their prices, raising their taxes, others, to keep up because \nthey just had to raise wages, not for our brothers and sisters that are \nout there working to live better but basically just to be able to \npurchase the same things.\n  Except at the end of 2021, Americans were poorer. The fact of the \nmatter is, the average American fell about 2.7 to 3 percent poorer \nbecause inflation grew faster than their wages did. But there are lots \nof things in the economic literature--and I know I am geeking out a \nlittle bit--that you start to end up in this seesaw effect, what they \ncall a wage-price spiral. Businesses keep having to raise their costs \nbecause now they have to raise the wages, and it becomes a very, very \nugly circle.\n  A bit of trivia. How many of you here would immediately say to go \nback to the 1980s, particularly the early 1980s? It was Paul Volcker \njacking up interest rates to just extraordinary levels that squeezed \nout inflation. That is actually only part of the story. If you actually \nlook at the math during that time, there were the Reagan tax cuts, the \nfirst round of them. They created a great spike in productivity. \nBecause one of the things inflation is, is I have too much money \nchasing too few goods, so raising interest rates, making everything \nmore expensive, still doesn't do anything to make sure you are making \nmore goods, more services, to fill up that vacuum to remove that \ninflationary pressure.\n  You actually even see some of that data after we did tax reform here \nat the very, very end of 2017, when you saw the spike in productivity. \nYou saw a pretty impressive spike for 2 years of wages and actually \nfalling inflation. Why was that? It is because expensing and other \nthings we did in tax reform, repatriation, getting hundreds of billions \nof dollars from around the world coming back into the country, actually \nraised productivity and lowered prices. That is the holy grail. Right \nnow, almost every policy that the administration and, I hate to say, \nthis body is engaging in is counter to that.\n  We are going to walk through a couple of things here, and our \nargument is really simple. Almost every major policy set being moved \nforward--and I don't think it is purposeful; I think it is a \nmisunderstanding of the most basic economics--that my Democrat brothers \nand sisters are doing is actually making life more miserable. I don't \nthink it is purposeful, but it is economics.\n  Let's walk through the facts, just the actual math. I know this is \nalways uncomfortable, but if you actually look at the data that came \nin, when you look at the expenditures--because I am using this slide. \nThis is actually a 2019 slide, but it is important to set the base. Our \nbrothers and sisters who are in the lowest quartiles--and I hate that \nterm, but it is what we use in economics--dramatically more of their \nincome goes to pay for housing, dramatically more goes to pay for their \ntransportation and food. Those in the upper incomes, that is not where \nthey live.\n  Think about what has gone on in this last year. Most everyone who is \nin this room, probably most everyone who is watching this, we are the \npeople who have savings. We have retirement accounts. We have 401(k)'s. \nLife has gotten more expensive for us, but how many of you have a home \nthat has gone up dramatically in value? Think about those lower income \nquartiles, that working poor, that middle class, that lower middle \nclass. Do they have a home? Are they renters? How much of their cost is \ntheir transportation or just trying to provide housing? What we have \nallowed to happen inflation-wise is just brutalizing them.\n  When you actually start to understand what the policies from this \nlast year have done--and I am going to show a number of these things, \nshowing that the left's policies are actually crushing the poor, the \nworking poor, and the middle class.\n\n  The difference here, when you see this type of graph, is we are \ntrying to sort of demonstrate that it is both the effects on \npopulations where you are income-wise--if you are in this lower income, \nhow much more the cost of your life is because of inflation. This is \nalmost just a pure demonstration of who benefits and who doesn't \nbenefit.\n  If you are a homeowner, if you are someone with lots of assets and \nthe stock market has been really good to you, you have come out ahead. \nIf you are like most in the middle class and lower, your standard of \nliving has gone down.\n  There is this rule of thumb from the top line. What are the two \nthings you do to make the working poor poorer? I have said this dozens \nof times behind this microphone. It is inflation, and it is opening up \nthe border.\n  There is this economic theory--and this is actually old literature. \nIt is like 20 years old, and it actually had a number of left groups as \npart of the authors who basically said if you look at the working poor, \na population who probably didn't finish high school, what they sell is \ntheir labor, their willingness to work, their willingness to sweat. \nWhat happens when you flood\n\n[[Page H248]]\n\nyour society, functionally, in 1 year, with a couple of million people \nwith similar skill sets? It is just basic math. You functionally have \ndevalued the value of their labor. You have given them the double \nwhammy. You have created inflation, which affects the poor and the \nmiddle class more dramatically.\n  You saw from the first chart how much more of their resources go to \npay for housing, to pay for transportation, and to pay for food. Now \nyou make them compete against a couple of million people with similar \nskill sets. These aren't IT jobs. This isn't someone who is at the top \nof the wage scale and creates a multiplier of productivity in society \nbecause they are inventing some new app. This is the person who is \nhanging drywall, working their hearts out. It is a tough job. Their \nback is aching at the end of the night. Now they look out and there are \na couple of million other people in society with similar skill sets.\n  It is a level of misunderstanding. Some folks will come behind these \nmicrophones and pretend they are being compassionate, not understanding \nthe cruelty of inflation and having an open border and how many working \npoor are getting crushed by this.\n  I want to go a bit further. As you start to look at the inflation \nlevel, you have to understand--7 percent was sort of the national \nnumber, right? In markets like mine, in the Phoenix area, we were at \n9.7 percent inflation in 2021. A lot of that is because I am from a \ngrowth area. Lots of people are abandoning California and Illinois and \nmoving into my neighborhood, so much of my inflation is actually \nhousing.\n  We have already heard other people come behind the mikes, even today, \nand talk about the cost of housing. Well, congratulations. In other \nparts of the country, it is not 7 percent. In mine, it is 9.7 percent. \nWhen we look at the charts and the details, it really, really has hurt \nthe working poor, and they are having trouble finding the most basic \naccommodations.\n  Then we start to dig in more. The economists have made it very clear \nthat what was allowed to go on in 2021--the economics warns of \ninflationary inequity. The details are pretty clear. For those who have \nassets, you are going to do okay. If you are part of half of America \nwho doesn't have those few thousand dollars in the bank or owns a house \nor has other assets, you have become poorer. The policies are making \nyou poorer.\n  I know this is uncomfortable, but you can't keep campaigning and \ndoing politics and saying, ``We care about the middle class, and we \ncare about the working poor,'' and then keep adopting policies that \nmake them poorer. At some point, the math always wins. Not the virtue \nsignaling, not the rhetoric, it is the math. We are making half of our \ncountry poorer.\n  One of the other projects we are working on in the Joint Economic \nCommittee, and a couple of us on the Ways and Means Committee, is also \ntrying to understand what other attributes there are.\n  I can keep coming to the microphone and talking about the open \nborder, and we have an administration that doesn't seem to give a darn \nbecause it is political. Their base has no trouble with a couple of \nmillion undocumented folks coming into the country.\n  Inflation is really, really ugly because the math is brutal. Do you \nhave any sense how high interest rates have to go to squeeze out this \ninflation? I think there is this fantasy that four marginal rate \nincreases this year somehow are going to tap down inflation.\n  I will make you a crazy--actually, it is not crazy; it is based on \nmath. At the final quarter of this year, you may be seeing 10 percent \ninflation. I hope I am wrong. But I was in front of this mike a year \nago saying I think we will be close to 7, and I actually underestimated \nit.\n  Going back to my opening comments, I really, really, really see in \nthe numbers that we are on the cusp of a wage-price spiral, and four \nmarginal quarter-point increases in interest rates ain't going to cut \nit unless Congress dramatically starts to think about policies that \nspike productivity. Except you have a left that now has an article of \nfaith that tax reform, that expensing, these things we did in the tax \ncode to bring hundreds of billions of dollars back into the country to \nget organizations to invest in plants and equipment to make workers \nmore productive so they could be paid more--well, we can't do that. \nExcept even the liberal economists agree it worked. It turns out, you \nneed to be doing things like that.\n  The left's Build Back Better social spending bill, because it delinks \nmoney, transfer payments from work, every dataset basically says it \nwill continue to spike inflation. At the end of 10 years--I came here \nwith the paper. It makes it very clear. At the end of 10 years, the \nworking poor are poorer because of the way the left has designed these \ntransfer payments without an expectation of participation in society \nand work. I thought we learned this 25 years ago, but somehow math is \nheresy.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  So let's go. What are some of the other attributes that make our \nbrothers and sisters in that lower middle class, working poor, in many \nof our neighborhoods, what else makes them poor?\n  We have touched on inflation. We have touched on flooding society \nwith millions of people with similar skill sets. When was the last time \nwe had someone remind us about the concentration of crime?\n  For most of the Members in this body, we don't live in neighborhoods \nthat are going to be subject to crime. How many Members here live \nbehind a gate? How many Members here have security?\n  I did a ride-along for 4 hours on Monday through north central \nPhoenix in neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood. The \nofficer I rode with had almost 28 years on the city of Phoenix police \nforce, and the most disadvantaged neighborhoods had the most crime.\n  Okay. There is an assault here. You see the person in that apartment, \nhe is a drug dealer. You are realizing, it is the folks living in \npoverty who are in the core of the crime. And then the left takes a \nposition of basically having verbal violence toward law enforcement.\n  But we know the data says, if you look at the concentrations of \npoverty, one of the attributes that makes someone poor is when someone \ncomes and steals their stuff. You are trying to work; someone steals \nyour tools. You are trying to survive; someone breaks into your car or \nsteals your automobile. It is another attribute that once again the \nleft's policies are this constant economic violence on the poor.\n  And then you start to go on another thing we are working on. This one \nis much more complex, but it is starting to prove the theory is true. \nHow many of you have ever heard the discussion about health \ndisparities? Urban poor, my Native American populations, even rural \npoor, there are health disparities, and it is absolutely true.\n  Our brothers and sisters with renal failure, diabetes, these things, \nwho are concentrated, we can almost draw data circles around them and \nsay, look at the income inequality of this neighborhood to a \nneighborhood that might be just down the street.\n  We have been trying to understand what the attributes are. Oddly \nenough, some of the attributes aren't race. They are health. They are \ncrime. They are education. But the one that no one here has focused on \nis actually health.\n  If you ever get a chance--and this is for anyone who is listening--\ntry to find the data of those who are suffering type 2 diabetes and the \nconcentration. Go find a heat map. It becomes a really interesting \ndiscussion because what I am making as my fourth attribute is our \nbrothers and sisters who are sicker.\n  So the left's attitude is, well, it is good politics, we will just \nput up a bunch more clinics. We will help them manage their diabetes. \nOkay. That is an honorable thing. Wouldn't it be much more \ncompassionate to cure, to disrupt?\n  So we do know, because it came out a year ago, but it is as if no one \nactually read it. We actually have the paper that was put together, a \nworking paper series from the Congressional Budget Office. It was \nfunctionally some of the data within the Democrats' H.R. 3. If you \nactually dig through the numbers within their working paper, it makes \nit clear that the Democrats--it is great politics--hey, we are going to \nlower drug prices. But the way they go about doing it a decade from \nnow, so many\n\n[[Page H249]]\n\ncures don't come. And as the paper talks about, it is the very cures \nfor things like potentially diabetes and other ailments that are \nconcentrated in our poor population.\n  So it is functionally the left's policy on something like H.R. 3--\nbecause if you think about their pricing mechanism where if a drug \ncosts more than this amount of money, you can't have it. It is once \nagain policy that says, we are going to find a way for you to live with \nyour misery, but we are going to make living with your misery a little \ncheaper. Then I think the thing that is loving and more compassionate \nis we are going to find a way to cure it. It really is a different \nmindset, and that isn't Republican or Democrat. It is just compassion.\n  But it may not be great politics because the fact of the matter is, \nif you look at the mechanics within H.R. 3, the Democrats actually make \nBig Pharma more profitable and bigger and more powerful, and they wipe \nout the disrupters, the small biologics, the small pharma that is \nactual chewing away their book of business because they are curing the \ndisease whereas Big Pharma over here is just maintaining it.\n  It is the classic economic irony of this place acts like a protection \nracket. We give great speeches about how we are going to do this, and \nthen--wink, wink, nod, nod--what actually is happening is you are \nlocking in someone's oligopoly.\n  Once again, if you go through the paper, it makes it really clear \nthat the first couple of years there is not much difference because it \nis what is already in the disruptive pharmaceutical pipeline. And we \nhave done presentations here of 100 new are-under-research and only a \nfew actually succeed. But in about 5 or 6 years you start to see a \ncollapse of those cures. Welcome to Democrat policy once again.\n  We have come to the floor multiple times with H.R. 3. We have made a \nnumber of people very angry by referring to it as the Big Pharma \nprotection act. But the math is the math. And now you still have \nadditional CBO studies that make it clear we are telling the truth. It \nis what it is.\n  We have actually made proposals to our brothers and sisters on the \nleft saying, we both are enraged at the price of pharmaceuticals. \nBelieve it or not there are other ways to get there, and one of the \nmost magical things we could do for society are also some of the \nkickers to make sure there are capital stacks and these other things \nthat are a little geeky, but ways that that investment goes into the \ncures.\n  So when you have things like a single-shot cure for hemophilia--I did \nthis presentation back in December. We have a proof of concept of a \ncure for type 1 diabetes. Starting out, these are going to be really \nexpensive, they are going to be really difficult until we functionally \nturn it into a biofoundry, and you build the capital stack, the Tax \nCode, the incentives to do lots of that. But I can show you in chart \nafter chart, it saves society, it saves taxpayers a fortune in the \nfuture.\n\n  Remember, last year's CBO math said in 29 years we are $112 trillion \nin debt in publicly borrowed money in today's dollars. So that is \ninflation-adjusted dollars. And we know that number is going to spike \nonce we get the math from this last fiscal year plugged in there. About \n75 percent of that spending is just Medicare, that debt is Medicare. \nThe other 25 percent is Social Security.\n  The most powerful thing you can do for U.S. sovereign debt is disrupt \nthe price of healthcare, and our argument is, the greatest elegance is \nactually doing it by making people healthier.\n  There is one other thing I want to throw in my frustration of \nDemocrat policy. My expertise is more Arizona and not the rest of the \ncountry. We have seen the debate around here, lots of flowery words, \nand almost no detail of the reality of what is underlying the piece of \nlegislation.\n  Our friends on the left will come behind the microphones and say it \nis a Voting Rights Act. Okay. How is giving a politician six to one--so \nyou give me $200, and the Treasury is going to multiply it by six \ntimes--defending democracy? Or is that, once again, the left being so \nmuch smarter than Republicans are on how to try to stay in power?\n  How about some of the other things that are in the Democrats' H.R. 1 \nand H.R. 4, their Federal election bill?\n  My theory is a little different than other folks. It is just a \nblatant power grab. It is not a power grab for the Federal Government, \nwhich it is that, but it is much more than that. It is a power grab by \na party that basically is trying to design the election code to fit \ntheir fund-raising model, their campaign model.\n  It does other things. Like down here, my State for functionally 18 \nyears has had voter ID laws. Every dataset out there says you can't \nfind a differential of populations not being able to vote. Matter of \nfact, I think in my State some of the underlying data is African-\nAmerican females have the highest participation. It is actually White \nmales, particularly White rural males that have some of the lowest \nparticipation and some of my Native Americans. But that doesn't meet \nthe folklore that we get from our brothers and sisters on the left.\n  Think about this--and this is the circle I want folks who are paying \nattention to get their heads around--how it works. So the Democrats \npush a voting rights bill, but it is really about voting mechanics. And \nwhat they do is they say, Hey, we are going to have same-day, automatic \nregistration, and then we are going to legalize, industrialize ballot \nharvesting, and then at the same time we are going to do this they also \nare allowed to have, if you give them money, they get six to one. So \nwhy would you do that?\n  Well, first off, as in California, the Democrats have built a huge \ninfrastructure. If you run for Congress, you actually take a \nsubstantial portion of your campaign money and hire firms that go knock \non doors and harvest ballots. It is now a campaign mechanic.\n  Well, what happens if you hire lots of people to go walk through that \nmassive apartment building or this and that and knock on the door and \nsay, Hey, I will register you right here, let's do your ballot. That is \nfunctionally what they are doing in this legislation.\n  And the beauty of it, it will ultimately be taxpayers who will be \nfinancing it because the left, to their credit, has spent about the \nlast 15, 20 years building an online contribution system. And here is \nthe kicker. That online contribution system has trained contributors to \nthe left, contributors to Democrats who say, don't give one person this \nmuch money, give 10 people this much. And it is as if it has always \nbeen laid out the same, and--wink, wink, nod, nod--one day we are going \nto set up a public funding system so your $25 contribution or $200 \ncontribution gets multiplied six times.\n  You have got to give the left, the Democrats credit for their, just, \naudacity. And then to call it a civil rights voting bill when, when you \nbreak through its mechanics, it is about power, it is about power and \ncontrol. That is what this is.\n  The other beauty is handing the bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C., \nthe functionality of saying they can tell my State of Arizona what is \nallowed and what isn't allowed.\n  We have a family saying that goes, money, power, vanity, but most of \nthe time it is about the money. In this case, I have got to give the \nleft credit. They hit all three in the same piece of legislation. It \nbecomes about the money, it becomes about them keeping the power, but \nreality has almost nothing to do with fairness. It is about the fear \nthat the public understands how much of the left's policies have been \ncrappy to them, their families, this country. The mechanism they are \ngoing to try to keep in power is to functionally have us finance their \nelections and allow them to industrialize the very bad acts that so \nmany of us worry about.\n  Madam Speaker, I think I feel a little better getting some of that \nout of my system. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nGrothman) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, there are several issues of importance \nthat I don't feel this body has spent enough time discussing, and \nunless\n\n[[Page H250]]\n\nthey are addressed could result in a great deal of discomfort for a lot \nof Americans.\n  The first is the issue concerning sheltered workshops, also known as \nwork centers or community rehabilitation programs.\n  Perhaps you folks are familiar with them. They are places where \npeople of different abilities frequently work, frequently doing \npackaging, maybe light manufacturing.\n  Because of the different abilities that some people have, they have \nto get what are called 14(c) certificates and may work for less than \nminimum wage. Disabilities they may have would include things like \nperhaps spina bifida or similar things that make it a little bit more \ndifficult for them to work.\n  Nevertheless, throughout my political career I have always enjoyed \ntouring the sheltered workshops in part because the employees that work \nthere are so proud of the work they are doing and so proud of the fact \nthat they are able to earn a paycheck and purchase some of their own \nclothes, perhaps purchase gifts for their relatives.\n  Right now these sheltered workshops are under attack in the Build \nBack Better bill, and that bill may easily pass some time in the next \nyear. I am afraid even the majority of Democrats who voted for the bill \nare unaware that these sheltered workshops are under attack.\n  There are two reasons why people want to get rid of sheltered \nworkshops. There are people who feel under no circumstances should \nsomebody make less than minimum wage. This is ignoring the economic \nreality and ignoring the reality of the type of jobs that are available \nfor these folks.\n  The second concern they have is they feel that these people are \nsegregated from the rest of society working in a sheltered workshop. \nThat is, of course, not true. There are people of all sorts of \nabilities in these workshops; and in my opinion, people who work in \nthese workshops frequently work there for 25 or 30 years. And people in \nmanagement also work there for an extended period of time.\n  Nevertheless, there is an extreme group which feels that we are \ntaking advantage of people by having them work in the workshop.\n  I will point out that in addition to the ability to have some of your \nown economic independence, you develop lifelong friends in these \nworkshops that you wouldn't develop if you were looking for other jobs \nout in the community.\n  One of the concerns for people with different abilities is that it is \nimportant that they develop friendships other than just their parents \nor immediate family. It is something that is always of great concern \nfor parents of people in situations like this, and insofar as the \nsheltered workshops were shut down, you wouldn't have this natural \ngrouping of friends or lifelong coworkers that you are going to be able \nto interact with.\n  It is time for the sheltered workshop community to wake up and \nrealize in this bill of thousands of pages the radical group that wants \nto shut down the sheltered workshops may finally get their dream. And \nif they get their dream, they will find that some of these folks are \ngoing to find jobs in the community, but they are not going to find 35 \nor 40 hour a week jobs in the community. They may find 3 or 4 hour a \nweek jobs in the community. They will lose the pride that comes with \nhaving a full-time job. They will no longer feel they are like their \nsiblings or friends who go to work every day and earn a paycheck. It \nwill be devastating for these folks. Some folks have been working in \nthese sheltered workshops for 25 or 30 years and have years left to go. \nIt is tragic that some people want to take this freedom away from them.\n  I should also point out that nobody forces anybody to work in these \nsheltered workshops. If there were other jobs in the community they or \ntheir guardians could take them out and have them work fast food or \nhave them work light retail or have them work in some light \nmanufacturing. But what these people who are trying to get rid of these \nsheltered workshops are doing is they are taking away the choice that \nthese folks have made for themselves, the choice that makes them feel \nso happy, makes them feel so good.\n  So I strongly encourage people who know someone in these workshops to \nget politically involved before these folks' lives are devastated.\n  And insofar as we have any of the Democrats paying attention to what \nI am saying right now, I beg you to go in your district and tour one of \nthe sheltered workshops yourself because they will make you feel so \ngood.\n  There are very few things in this job that make me feel as good as \ntouring these workshops because you see how happy and productive people \ncan be that on the face of it seem to be dealt a tough hand in life. \nBut they have made what they can of themselves. They are very happy. \nAnd I beg the majority party not to take away this right.\n  The second issue that I would like to talk about a little bit today \nis with regard to COVID.\n  One of the frustrating things about the establishment--and I think \nthis goes back even before the Biden administration--is there has not \nbeen enough discussion of the correlation of inadequate amounts of \nVitamin D and getting severe cases of COVID.\n  Right now in this country, all Americans should be aiming at having \n30 nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin D. People who fail to get that \n30 nanograms disproportionately wind up getting COVID and getting COVID \nseverely.\n  There are other things that make you more likely to get COVID. If you \nhave diabetes, if you are overweight, these are other things that \ncorrelate with getting COVID. And we know that if you lose a little \nweight, your situation would improve.\n\n  Vitamin D or a lack of having 30 nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin \nD does correlate with problems. Right now in our society, sadly, 96 \npercent of Black Americans are insufficient to that level, 88 percent \nof Hispanics, 65 percent of Whites. It is not something that has been \ntalked about anywhere near enough, and it is a question as to why the \npublic health establishment has not done a better job of explaining the \ncorrelation between bad Vitamin D outcomes and bad COVID outcomes.\n  Some people feel it is not something that is talked about enough \nbecause there is no money to be made. And, of course, a lot of people \nare making a lot of money on COVID; but if you solve your Vitamin D \nlevels by just going to the local drugstore and buying 20 or $40 worth \nof Vitamin D pills, there is not the possibility of people to make \nbillions of dollars.\n  Nevertheless, if you are out there, I strongly encourage all \nAmericans to get a hold of Vitamin D. Vitamin C and zinc are good, as \nwell, but today I try one more time to beg my friends back home to go \nget some Vitamin D, and I beg the medical community who right now does \nnot test for Vitamin D like they should; I am told it is because there \nis not enough reimbursement in Medicare, and we don't want to lose \nmoney on what we are doing, but the medical community ought to be \ntesting everybody for Vitamin D if they come in for their annual \ncheckup. All Americans should be looking to get that level above 30 \nnanograms per milliliter.\n  There are other things, as well, that could be done to reduce the \nhigh number of deaths from COVID. Fenofibrate is a drug which some \nIsraeli researchers had success with. It is a generic drug, and as a \nresult, it is very reasonable to get a hold of. The same thing is true \nwith hydroxychloroquine. And there are doctors I know who have had \nsuccess with that. I don't think it is quite as successful with the \nomicron variant, but it was very successful with the alpha variant. And \nthere is ivermectin, and I have known doctors who have used that, and \nthey have had success curing people there. But for whatever reason, on \nsome of these cheaper alternatives that I think could have saved \nhundreds of thousands of people, the public health establishment and \nthe medical establishment has not been as outspoken as they should.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline.)\n  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for \nyielding on this very important subject. I was unfortunate to catch \nCOVID a couple weeks ago, and I think that the Vitamin D supplements I \nwas taking in addition to Vitamin C, in addition to zinc definitely \nhelped to minimize the length and the severity of the illness.\n  Madam Speaker, today marks 1 year since Joe Biden was sworn in as \nPresident, meaning it has been a year since\n\n[[Page H251]]\n\nDemocrats took unified control of the Federal Government.\n  And at this point there is no denying that Americans are worse off \ntoday than they were 12 months ago.\n  Consumer prices have risen 7 percent since Democrats won \ncongressional majorities and the White House, marking a 40-year high \nrate of inflation.\n  Gas prices reached $3.28 a gallon last month, a 49.6 percent increase \nfrom a year ago.\n  1.7 illegal immigrants were encountered unlawfully crossing the \nborder in FY21, the highest number ever recorded.\n  Sixteen major U.S. cities set new homicide records this past year.\n  And just last week, COVID hospitalizations hit a record high.\n  Thirteen American servicemembers tragically lost their lives, and the \nTaliban captured Afghanistan as a result of this administration's \ndisastrous withdrawal plan.\n  Madam Speaker, Democrats are certainly setting records, just not the \nrecords that they want to be breaking. Their party has utterly failed \nthe American people.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I would like to address another, perhaps \ninadvertent, perhaps not so inadvertent, group of provisions in the \nBuild Back Better bill.\n  As we look across the country, when one compares to where America is \ntoday compared to where America was 50 years ago, certainly one area \nthat I think most Americans would think is a step in the wrong \ndirection is the breakdown of the traditional family. However, not all \npeople consider the breakdown in the so-called western prescribed \nnuclear family structure as a bad thing.\n  Black Lives Matter, which played such a big role in the elections \nlast November, on their website came out saying we want to disrupt the \nwestern prescribed nuclear family structure.\n  They are not the only ones who don't like the western family. We know \nKarl Marx felt that as he wanted to work his way towards paradise, we \nhad to get rid of the traditional family.\n  I don't know whether it is a coincidence or not, but our current \nwelfare system with all of the programs that are part of it, be it the \neducation grants, be it the medical grants, be it the food stamps, be \nit the low-income housing, are all set not to benefit families in which \nthere are two parents at home to raise the children.\n  In other words, the United States for years and years has been trying \nto get rid of the nuclear family. It is like Karl Marx himself were \nwriting the welfare policies.\n  In the Build Back Better bill, we are going further on down this \nline. I don't know that this is exactly supposed to be a pay back to \nBlack Lives Matter, but the reconciliation bill will more than double \nthe earned income tax credit marriage penalty. It has provisions for \ngreatly increasing the number of low-income housing units. And I feel \nthat the way those units are doled out, again, very difficult to get \nthose units if you have a mom and dad at home. But there are people who \nwant to get rid of that sort of family.\n  I would strongly encourage the majority party, before they push this \nbill any further, to have a study done on who benefits from these new \nprovisions and who doesn't, and is it one more time a situation which \nwe are bribing people not to have old-fashioned nuclear families.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  I am afraid, like I said, right now, this looks like another victory \nfor the hard leftwing of the Democratic Party that embraces the idea \nthat we ought to get rid of the nuclear family. It is not a \ncoincidence. It is in the bill.\n  In any event, these are things I will leave our audience with as we \nbreak for the following week. If you know somebody who works in a \nsheltered workshop or work center, or know a Congressman, invite them \nto the sheltered workshops to see what they are in danger of shutting \ndown.\n  If you know people who do not yet have COVID, remind them to get more \nvitamin D. If there are any doctors out there--I know sometimes you \ncan't be reimbursed for everything, but you guys make enough money--\nmake sure you begin to do some testing of vitamin D levels so that if \npeople are below 30 nanograms per milliliter, they know it and they \nknow that they should go to the drugstore and begin to get more vitamin \nD, together with zinc and vitamin C.\n  Finally, I encourage the majority party, before they do any more with \nBuild Back Better, to have some work done and see whether you really \nwant to go ahead and further steepen the penalty for married couples \nwho have children, which already, like I said, is like the policy of \nthe United States: We don't want to have old-fashioned nuclear \nfamilies.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, very few people find the time to lead \ntheir city's largest law firm, serve on a university's board of \ntrustees, represent their country at the United Nations, and remain \nactive in civic life in their hometown. Even fewer can accomplish these \nthings before the age of 40. But Jennifer Barber of Louisville, KY, has \nmanaged to do all this--and more. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me \nin honoring Jennifer for her recent career milestone and for her years \nof service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Jennifer, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up working \nalongside her parents in the family's restaurant, learning to value \nsacrifice, ambition, and effort. She became the first member of her \nfamily to graduate college, earning both her bachelor's degree and \njuris doctorate from the University of Kentucky. From there, she \ndeveloped a specialty in tax law, taking her expertise to Frost Brown \nTodd in 2013 and working her way up the corporate ladder.\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\n  Jennifer's professional and academic successes only tell half the \nstory of her remarkable career. She has also dedicated her time, \nenergy, and talent to a range of important Kentucky organizations, from \nthe University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, to the Kentucky State \nFair Board, to the Kentucky Bar Foundation. In 2020, she took a brief \nbreak from her law firm to take her talents to the global stage, \nserving as a special adviser to the U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations and a U.S. Delegate to the United Nations where she helped \nadvance American priorities on human rights and foreign aid.\n  Jennifer's professional accomplishments are so exciting because she \nachieved them at such a remarkably young age. Jennifer has done \nincredible work to improve Kentucky and serve our Nation, and I am \nconfident her recent promotion is just the first in a long list of \nsuccesses yet to come.\n  Louisville Business First highlighted Jennifer Barber's new role in a \nrecent article. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From Louisville Business First, Jan. 18, 2022]\n\n        Louisville's Largest Law Firm Names New Member-In-Charge\n\n       Jennifer Barber was the first in her family to graduate \n     high school. Now, she's stepping into the member-in-charge \n     role at Frost Brown Todd LLC, the largest law firm in \n     Louisville.\n       In an interview with Business First last week, Barber, the \n     daughter of Chinese immigrants, recalled working alongside \n     her parents in the restaurant they owned, attributing her \n     belief in the value of sacrifice and hard work to them. She \n     said she saw their determination to provide a greater \n     opportunity for her and her sisters.\n       ``I'm very proud to be the first in my family to graduate \n     from high school and then college and law school, and I say \n     that very humbly. It's not something that I feel is something \n     to pat myself on the back for,'' she said. ``I feel very much \n     like, if not for our great country, which has endless \n     opportunities for people who live here, and my parents being \n     able to immigrate here and to make sacrifices and work hard . \n     . . I wouldn't be able to be now the member-in-charge.''\n       She's been with Frost Brown Todd since 2013. Her focus \n     there has been on tax law, economic incentives and government \n     affairs. She's also taken the lead on the firm's civic and \n     charitable engagement. She took a brief break from her \n     practice to serve as a United States delegate to the United \n     Nations and as a special adviser to U.S. ambassador to Canada \n     Kelly Craft for the 2020 session.\n       As Barber spoke about each of these roles: the UN, the law \n     firm, the charitable work, and her parents, she kept coming \n     back to the concept of wanting to give back to her community.\n       As a young attorney, she said she sought opportunities \n     where she'd be able to help people, and she ultimately landed \n     on tax law. She said her work with companies in this field \n     allows her to assist with the city's economic development.\n       ``Part of my civic engagement is to help these companies \n     thrive, because when they thrive, we see that our communities \n     are thriving,'' she said. ``Our citizens, our residents are \n     employed and through taxes, we fund schools, and we fund fire \n     departments, and we fund libraries . . . I think to the \n     extent that we can spur stronger economic growth in our \n     communities, everything else tends to rise as well.''\n       She completed both her undergraduate and law degrees from \n     the University of Kentucky. She served on the university's \n     board of trustees, as well as its athletic committee. (Plus, \n     she's an avid sports fan--specifically cheering for the \n     Wildcats.)\n       She's also served on the Kentucky State Fair Board, U.S. \n     Bank Advisory Board, Louisville Bar Association Board of \n     Directors, Kentucky Bar Foundation, and American Bar \n     Association Tax Section Executive Committee.\n       While working with the UN, Barber said her main focus was \n     on foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian assistance. \n     She said it was a humbling experience to serve the country \n     and see firsthand the positive impacts the U.S. has on the \n     rest of the world.\n       She said her background as a daughter of immigrants helped \n     her understand and empathize with others during her work at \n     the UN.\n       ``My family immigrated here from China . . . for me to be \n     able to sit behind that United States placard and deliver \n     remarks on behalf of the United States, it's really one of \n     the greatest honors,'' Barber said.\n       At the time of our conversation, Barber had only held the \n     member-in-charge role for about two weeks. She said her \n     mission within the role was for the firm to continue to \n     provide good client service and give back to its communities.\n       ``It's not lost on me that . . . I am minority, and I am a \n     woman, and I'm so pleased to have this role for many \n     reasons,'' she said.'' . . . I just think it's a reflection \n     of our firm and the legal profession as a whole really \n     diversifying leadership and different perspectives.''\n       Barber is taking over the member-in-charge role from Geoff \n     White, who held the position for seven years. White is still \n     working for the firm in other leadership roles, according to \n     a news release on the leadership changes.\n       The law firm, which has 294 local employees in total and \n     153 local attorneys according to the most recent LBF \n     research, also announced that member Jason Williams will \n     serve on the executive committee, the firm's equivalent of a \n     board of directors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, today I wish to recognize Gary \nAmble of Kansas City, KS. For the last 30 years, Gary has worked for \nhis community by broadcasting the weather. I would like to congratulate \nhim on his retirement from KCTV5 and thank him for the invaluable \nservice that he has provided Kansas over the last three decades.\n  In 1987, Gary graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree \nin atmospheric science. Before his employment at KCTV5, Gary worked as \nthe head anchor at WHO-TV in Des Moines, morning meteorologist for KDFA \nin Amarillo, weekend weathercaster for KSNT in Topeka, and chief \nweathercaster for Cable 6 in Lawrence. While in Des Moines, he worked \n22 hours continuously live on the air covering the unprecedented flood \nof 1993, which affected nine States along the Missouri and Mississippi \nRivers. He has described it as a highlight of his career. Gary's tenure \nat KCTV5 began in the summer of 1994, where he would stay for the next \n28 years. There, he cemented himself as the Kansas City area's familiar \nface of weather, always charismatic and--most importantly--accurate \nwhenever he came on screen. Because of his distinguished career, Gary \nhas been awarded the American Meteorological Society seal of approval, \nand is currently a member of the society.\n  Tracking and reporting on the weather is great public service, so I \ntake pride in recognizing Gary Amble as an exceptional member of the \nKansas community. I would like to wish Gary and his family the best in \nthis new chapter of their lives.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, I rise today to honor and \nmemorialize a true representation of Kansas values. Mrs. Ruth Scheer \ndeparted this Earth on January 4, 2022, after a long life full of \nfaith, family, service, and community.\n  Ruth was born and raised in Wichita, KS, where her parents, Clyde and \nEdith, provided a childhood full of love and support. She quickly \npicked up a love for music, beginning with the accordion before she \nturned 10. Her musical efforts, nurtured by her parents, continued to \ngrow as she did. Ruth's talent and dedication were rewarded by the \nopportunity to perform in the National Piano Playing Auditions and \nwinning multiple piano diplomas throughout high school and college. Her \nlove of music and the arts continued as she started a family with her \nhusband, Harold. She taught her children to play various instruments \nand sing. She even led the family to perform multiple operettas in the \ncommunity as the ``Scheer Delights.''\n  Beyond music, Ruth also inspired children by publishing seven \nchildren's books. Each book contained different messages, but at the \nheart of her literary philosophy was finding the best version of one's \nself through God's guidance. These books have undoubtedly touched many \nlives, and I appreciate that she spent her career bringing such a \nwonderful sentiment to life.\n  Ruth practiced what she preached by finding the best version of \nherself and employing her time and talents with an impressive number of \nprominent organizations throughout Wichita. Highlights of her \ninvolvement include the First Evangelical Free Church, 3-time president \nof the Thursday Afternoon Music Club, member of the Alpha Beta Mothers \nClub, and she even received the Kansas Mother of the Year Award.\n  In my own life, my parents showed me the importance of community and \nstaying involved. A strong, connected community benefits its members by \nfostering happiness and success. Ruth embodied what it means to be a \ncommunity builder, mother, and teacher. Wichita is a better place \nbecause of her efforts. She is a role model everyone should strive to \nemulate in their own communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nremembering Ruth Scheer and celebrating a life well-lived.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The majority leader, Senator Schumer, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in the fall of 1868, recently freed \nAfrican-American men participated in Federal elections for the first \ntime in American history. According to Ron Chernow's biography of \nUlysses S. Grant, the impacts of expanding the vote were immediate and \ndramatic.\n\n       In a startling reversal for an area once dominated by \n     slavery, the elections spawned black sheriffs, school board \n     members, state legislators, and congressmen. That yesterday's \n     slave laborer was today's state legislator horrified many \n     white southerners who refused to accept this extraordinary \n     inversion of their bygone world.\n\n  Naturally, the opponents of voting rights had an answer. Chernow \ncontinues:\n\n       [T]o circumvent the fifteenth amendment, white politicians \n     in Georgia [and other states] devised new methods of \n     stripping blacks of voting rights, including poll taxes, \n     onerous registration requirements--\n\n  Let me repeat that quote.\n\n       [O]nerous registration requirements, and similar \n     restrictions copied in other states.\n\n  Many attempts were made by this very body to stop these sinister \nlaws, but the result was ultimately a failure.\n  By 1877, ``the black community in the South steadily lost ground \nuntil a rigid apartheid separated the races completely, a terrible \nstate of affairs that would not be fixed until the rise of the civil \nrights movement after World War II.''\n  Today, the U.S. Senate meets in a different century, facing new and \ndifferent dangers but wrestling with the same fundamental question: How \nwill the Members of this body protect and expand the most basic right \nof American citizens, the wellspring of our democracy, the thing that \ndistinguished America from all of the countries in Europe when it was \nestablished in, first, 1776 and then 1789--the right to vote--the most \nimportant wellspring of our democracy, the most important feature of \nour democracy?\n  How will the Members of this body expand and protect the most basic \nright--the right to vote--from forces, right now in the 21st century, \nconspiring to take it away?\n  That is why, today, the U.S. Senate will debate legislation to \nprotect our\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\ndemocracy, and the eyes of history--the eyes of history--are upon us.\n  The question that is before us today is as old as the Republic \nitself. The story of democracy has been a long march toward universal \nsuffrage, a holy struggle to take the vision of our Framers and make it \nreal in the present.\n  The march, unfortunately, has often not been linear. At the time of \nour Constitution's ratification, you had to be, in many States, a \nWhite, male, Protestant, landowner to vote. How many in this Chamber \nwould have been able to participate in those early elections?\n  Throughout our Nation's history, moments of significant progress have \noften been followed by reactionary backlash. Unfortunately, it seems--\nled by one party, compelled by the most dishonest President in our \nhistory--we are in another of those dark periods.\n  That is why, for the first time--the first time--in this Congress, \nthe Senate is debating and will vote on legislation to confront these \nthreats: the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act.\n  For the information of all, debate on these bills will continue \nthroughout the day. And as soon as 6:30, if not a little bit later, we \nwill hold a cloture vote to conclude debate and proceed to final \npassage on these measures.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who spoke yesterday in favor of these \nbills. There were so many eloquent and strong speeches. At our caucus, \nI have rarely seen such passion about the need to vote and the need to \nchange the rules to allow these vital bills--so fixed upon the \nwellspring of our democracy, voting--to pass.\n\n  If the Republicans block cloture on the legislation before us, I will \nput forward a proposal to change the Senate rules to allow for a \ntalking filibuster on this legislation, as recommended by a number of \nour colleagues who have been working on this reform for a very long \ntime.\n  Make no mistake, win, lose, or draw, Members of this Chamber were \nelected to debate and to vote, particularly on such an important issue \nas this. And win, lose, or draw, we are going to vote--we are going to \nvote--especially when the issue relates to the beating heart of our \ndemocracy, as voting rights does.\n  For months, Senate Republicans have resisted virtually every attempt \nat holding a bipartisan debate on voting rights legislation. Senate \nDemocrats have certainly tried to bring them onto the table.\n  Senate Democrats have certainly been willing to compromise to get \nsomething done. My colleagues Senators Manchin and Kaine and Tester and \nKing and Durbin and Klobuchar and Leahy--and many more--have all met \nwith Republicans to initiate a dialogue, dating back to last August, if \nnot earlier. At virtually every turn, we have been met with resistance.\n  And amazingly enough, my colleagues--none of them are here to hear \nit--our Republican colleagues don't even acknowledge that we have a \ncrisis. Leader McConnell even claimed that ``States are not engaged in \ntrying to suppress voters whatsoever.''\n  Let me read that quote again. This is from Leader McConnell's words:\n\n       States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters \n     whatsoever.\n\n  I would ask the Republican leader, if there is no effort to suppress \nthe vote, why have 19 States passed 33 new laws making it harder for \nAmericans to participate in our elections, in the aftermath of one of \nthe safest elections in American recent history, where there is \nvirtually no evidence of any material fraud--none.\n  If there is no effort to suppress the vote, why are States from Texas \nto Montana restricting the number and hours of polling places? Why have \nStates like Florida and Texas made it harder to register--to register--\nto vote? Is that not suppressing the vote?\n  Why are States like Iowa cutting down on the number of days you can \nvote early? Is that not suppressing the vote?\n  And if there is no effort to suppress the vote, why have States like \nGeorgia made it a crime for volunteers to give food and water to voters \nstanding in line at the polls?\n  Leader McConnell, once again:\n\n       States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters \n     whatsoever.\n\n  Just as Donald Trump has his Big Lie, Leader McConnell now has his:\n\n       States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters \n     whatsoever.\n\n  The same types of lies that have motivated--the same type of Big Lie \nthat Donald Trump put forward has now motivated Leader McConnell and \nmany other Republicans to embrace that Big Lie and spout others that \ncome from the same poisonous tree.\n  And what is even more galling, knowing our history, that the laws \nthat I spoke of a minute ago don't target everyone. This is not an \neffort aimed at everyone. They are aimed particularly at people of \ncolor, at poor people, at young people, at disabled people, at elderly \npeople, at people who live in cities. Given the long history, \nparticularly against African Americans, Black Americans, of suppressing \nthe vote in every kind of way possible, this is particularly \ndisgraceful, particularly abhorrent, particularly obnoxious.\n  We all know the game here today, exemplified by every seat being \nempty when we are having our first debate about voting rights, not \nbecause Republicans agreed to go along but because we were able to use \na message from the House to go forward without their OK.\n  So we all know the game here. To date, I don't know if any of you \nhave, but I have not heard a single serious defense of these laws from \nSenate Republicans. They don't come here to the floor to defend what is \ngoing on in the States. What we have heard is sophistry, distractions, \nand outright gaslighting.\n  For months, Senate Republicans have come up with excuses and \nsubterfuges to avoid doing the right thing, just like others have come \nup with similar lame excuses and subterfuges in the past. But this is \nthe 21st century. We are supposed to have gone beyond that, but \nunfortunately we have not. Facts are stubborn, and today's debate will \nhelp us arrive at the facts of voter suppression before we vote to take \naction. As we debate this issue so critical to the wellspring of our \ndemocracy, will we all confront a critical question: Shall Members of \nthis Chamber do what is necessary to pass these bills and move them to \nthe President's desk?\n\n  It is my hope that courage awakens within the heart of our Republican \ncolleagues before the day is out. But if the Senate cannot protect the \nright to vote, protect the cornerstone of our democracy under the \nexisting rules, then the Senate rules must be reformed.\n  Let me say this. We have diverse views about whether the filibuster \ntoday in 21st century America is a good thing or a bad thing. And there \nare some in our caucus who believe it helps bring--a few who believe it \nhelps bring--us together. I don't see evidence of that at all, and I \nthink the majority of my colleagues will agree with that. But even for \nthose who feel that the filibuster is a good thing and helps bring us \ntogether, I would ask this question: Isn't the protection of voting \nrights, the most fundamental wellspring of this democracy, more \nimportant? Isn't protecting voting rights and preventing their \ndiminution more important than a rule in the Senate, which has not \nalways been in existence and was not envisioned by the Founders? That \nis the question we should ask ourselves.\n  Our proposal for a talking filibuster on these pieces of legislation \nwould be the first step toward passing voting rights, restoring this \nbody, and breaking the gridlock that we now face on this vital issue.\n  In this body, proponents of our democratic rights, again and again, \nhave brought legislation to the floor only to be met by a filibuster. \nOpponents of fair, open elections filibustered anti-poll tax \nlegislation in 1942, 1944, 1946. They filibustered the civil rights \nbill of 1960. They filibustered legislation on literacy tests in 1962--\nall this before real substantive progress was made.\n  Our struggle today is not new, but we must nevertheless meet it with \nrenewed conviction. Senate Democrats are under no illusion that we face \nan uphill fight, especially when virtually every Republican has \nremained staunchly against every attempt to pass voting rights \nlegislation. Again, I would remind the American people and every one of \nmy colleagues that this is a different Republican Party controlled\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\nby Donald Trump. Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush \nall supported renewal of the Voting Rights Act--every one of them--and \nit received large bipartisan majorities in the Senate.\n  It is a different Republican Party, not just on so many issues that \nwe debate but on this issue, the wellspring of our democracy. So we \nknow it is an uphill fight. But whenever this Chamber confronts a \nquestion this important, one so vital to our country, you don't slide \nit off the table and say, ``Never mind.'' You don't say, ``We are not \ngoing to deal with this issue head-on.''\n  The Senators' job is to vote and to vote on the most important issues \nfacing us, and vote we will, and we are going to keep pushing. We are \ngoing to keep working. We are going to keep fighting long after today \nbecause the issue is so important to all of us.\n  I believe firmly in my bones, Mr. President, that if we follow Dr. \nKing's advice to just ``keep moving,'' history shows that doing the \nright thing will eventually prevail. Justice will flow like the mighty \nwaters, as the Prophet Amos has said.\n  But the work of justice does not stir into action on its own. It is \nup to us, Members of this body and Americans all across the country, to \ndo our part to make justice come alive today and assure that our \ncountry does not backslide here in the 21st century.\n  So I urge my colleagues, for the sake of our beautiful, wonderful \ndemocracy, for the sake of what the Founding Fathers called this \n``noble experiment,'' take a stand and do everything, everything, \neverything you can to protect voting rights today--today--in this \nChamber.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Democratic Party has had control of \nWashington for exactly 364 days. Tomorrow will mark exactly 1 year \nsince President Biden was inaugurated on the West Front and promised to \n``unit[e] our people,'' ``lower the temperature,'' and brin[g] America \ntogether.'' But today, the President and his party will try to use fear \nand panic to smash the Senate, silence millions of Americans, and seize \ncontrol of our democracy.\n  Now, there is no shortage of real crises Democrats might consider \ntackling: the worst inflation in 40 years, the seemingly endless \npandemic, soaring homicides, the border crisis, and Russia flirting \nwith war in Europe.\n  But the administration and this Senate majority are focused on none \nof that. Instead, they have been consumed by a fake panic over election \nlaws that seem to exist only in their own imaginations.\n  So let's put a few basic facts on the table. Fewer than one-half of 1 \npercent of American adults believe that election law is our country's \nmost important problem. When polls ask people what new Federal election \nlaws they want, the most popular response is ``none of the above.''\n  Actually, more Americans believe current voting laws are too lax than \nbelieve they are too restrictive. Let that sink in. You could have \ntaken in hundreds of hours of leftwing rhetoric and media coverage over \nthe past year and had no inkling of this basic fact. Significantly more \nAmericans believe current voting laws are too loose and insecure than \nbelieve are too restrictive.\n  Professional liberals have spent 3 straight years talking down our \ndemocracy, except a short period after they liked an election result \nand questioning elections was, at least briefly, off limits. But the \nAmerican people are not buying that. Democrats have spent years stoking \nfear and panic over voting laws and the American people simply do not \nbuy it. But while Washington Democrats' fake panic has failed to \npersuade the country, it could still deal permanent damage.\n  Today, the Senate will need to prevent this factional frenzy from \ndamaging our democracy, damaging the Senate, and damaging our Republic \nforever.\n  First, our democracy. Professional liberals' fake hysteria over State \nvoting laws is literally collapsing before our eyes. Even normally \nfriendly media outlets are asking Democrats why a law like Georgia's is \nsupposed to be outrageous when it is objectively more open than rules \nin blue States like Delaware and New York. President Biden's false \nstatement about one State law earned him--listen to this--``four \nPinocchios'' in the Washington Post. That is not easy to get. There is \nno factual standard by which any State in America is creating a civil \nrights crisis, not compared to their own prepandemic baselines, not \ncomparing across with other States.\n  What is more, Democrats' own paper trails refute the notion that this \nis about new State laws from 2021. Three years ago, in 2019, Leader \nSchumer was already giving interviews about supposed voter suppression. \nThe same conspiracy theories were being pushed back then. The same \nominous buzzwords were in vogue. And 3 years ago, in 2019, Democrats \nhad already introduced their first version of the legislation they will \nbe pushing today.\n  This party-line push has never been about securing citizens' rights. \nIt is about expanding politicians' power. That is why their bill tries \nto weaken voter ID laws that are popular with Americans of all races. \nThat is why their bill is stuffed with strange policies that have zero \nrelationship to ballot access, new powers for bureaucrats to police \ncitizens' speech online, new schemes where the Federal Government would \ndirectly fund political campaigns.\n  This is not some modest bill about ballot access. It is a sprawling \ntakeover of our whole political system. It was never even intended to \nattract bipartisan support. This partisan Frankenstein bill that the \nHouse Democrats slapped together was intended to do one thing, just one \nthing only: Give the Senate Democratic leader a pretext--a pretext--to \nbreak the Senate.\n  Later today, this Chamber will host a sad spectacle that has not been \nseen before in living memory. A sitting majority leader will attempt a \ndirect assault on the core identity of the Senate. Our colleague from \nNew York will try to kill the character of the institution he is \nsupposed to protect and to serve.\n  Now, the Democratic leader once said that breaking the rules to kill \nthe filibuster would turn the Senate into a ``rubberstamp of \ndictatorship,'' make America a ``banana republic'' and trigger ``a \ndoomsday for democracy.''\n  Several years ago, with no connection to this particular issue, he \nbegan talking about shredding minority protections if--if--he ever got \npower.\n  And now he wants to press that doomsday button.\n  The legislative filibuster is a central Senate tradition. It is the \nindispensable feature of our institution. It makes the Senate serve its \nfounding purpose--forging compromise, cooling passions, and ensuring \nthat new laws earn broad support from a cross section of our country.\n  The Senate is not supposed to be a duplicate House of Representatives \nwith fewer Members and fancier desks. This body is not supposed to \namplify huge swings in Federal law with every election. It exists to \nslow those swings and to bring stability.\n  The legislative filibuster is the only reason the Senate provides \nwhat James Madison called a ``complicated check'' on ``improper acts of \nlegislation.'' It embodies Thomas Jefferson's principle that ``great \ninnovations should not be forced on slender majorities.''\n  Killing the legislative filibuster--any way it happened--would hugely \ndamage the Senate, but doing so by nuking the rules would destroy the \nSenate. As I have explained at some length, this is true on the most \npractical level. A Senate in nuclear winter would not be a hospitable \nplace for either side.\n  As then-Senator Obama explained a decade and a half ago, ``If the \nmajority chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the \nrules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting and the \nbitterness and the gridlock will only get worse.''\n  Please note that, even in the Democratic leader's manufactured case, \neven when he presumably wanted the most persuasive theater he could \npossibly muster, the Senate will have only spent about a day and a half \non this bill before he tries to ram it through. Since when does the \nSenate pass any significant bill in a day and a half, much less a \ngigantic elections overhaul? Our colleague is not trying to conclude an \nunending discussion that\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nhe cannot stop; he is trying to short circuit a debate that he cannot \nwin. This is just the kind of shortsighted power grab this body was \nactually built to stop.\n  The case that most of our Democratic colleagues are making this week \nboils down to a claim that everything is somehow broken. The Senate is \nbroken because they can't get everything they want. Our democracy is \nbroken because Democrats sometimes lose elections. Entire States are \nbroken because voters vote the wrong way, and so their voices in this \nChamber should be totally silenced. Millions of American voters should \nbe denied any say whatsoever in this Chamber. Really? Really? Our \nDemocratic colleagues claiming our entire Republic is broken? That is \nwhat their anger and pessimism boils down to.\n  They say that we are hopelessly divided; that governing institutions \nthat have served us for centuries need to be smashed and steamrolled; \nthat we are fated to keep escalating brute-force battles with no end in \nsight. This is exactly the kind of toxic world view that this President \npledged to disavow, but it is exactly what has consumed his party on \nhis watch. You can literally hear it in their voices.\n  In the last few days, our President and his top allies have been \nreduced to shouting angrily at reporters and at the American people. \nThey are so certain they know best. How dare the rules, how dare the \nfacts, the Republicans, and millions of voters all obstruct their \nunique wisdom?\n  Well, the good news is that the fear is false. The rage is misplaced. \nAnd today, factional fevers will not carry the day.\n  The Senate is not broken. We have passed major, bipartisan bills this \nyear, and we have stopped partisan bills that lack support; exactly--\nexactly--the mixture the Framers imagined and Senators on both sides \npraised--praised--until the last few months. Our democracy is not \nbroken either. Citizens across America have ample opportunity to vote \nand say so to anybody who will listen to them. Our Republic is not \nbroken. Even with all the crises that Democrats' policies have created, \nwe remain fellow citizens who are blessed to live in the greatest \ncountry on Earth.\n  Today, it appears that a narrow, bipartisan majority of Senators will \nvote to save the Senate. With hope, with confidence, we will stand up \nand say that our institutions are worth protecting; that rules matter; \nthat no American deserves to have his or her voice in this Chamber \nsilenced. Ah, but a partisan minority will do the opposite. They will \ntry to smash and grab as much short-term power as they can carry.\n  For both groups of Senators, this vote will echo for generations. \nBefore we part ways tonight, all 100 of us will have marked our \nlegacies in permanent ink. Who will vote with hope and confidence in \nour people, and who will vote from anger, fear, and fake panic? Who \nwill vote to protect checks and balances, and who will try to purchase \npower at any price? Who has the courage to protect every single \nAmerican voice in this Chamber, no matter their home State, no matter \ntheir politics, and who will vote to silence millions of citizens for \nthe sin of voting for the wrong team? The American people deserve to \nknow, and from this day forward, they will.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Republican leader while \nhe is still on the floor, would you entertain a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Excuse me. No.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry that he did not stay for a question because I \nwould have asked the basic question phrased by Senator Schumer: Does he \nreally believe that there is no evidence of voter suppression in the \nactions of 19 States across our Nation? I think the facts speak for \nthemselves.\n  For those who are witnessing this, this is a rare moment in the \nhistory of this Chamber. In the recent history, it is rare because we \nare here; half of the seats are occupied in the U.S. Senate. That is a \nrare occurrence because it is rare that we come together to debate, to \namend, or to even exercise the authority given to us as U.S. Senators.\n  It is also a rare moment in history because we again are being called \non, as others have before us, to speak to the fundamentals of freedom \nand democracy and to go on record by the end of this day, when night \nfalls, as to where we stand in the sweep of history.\n  Approximately 155 million Americans voted in the 2020 election--\nhighest voter-turnout percentage since the 1900 election. A record \nnumber voted early or cast mail-in ballots--options that were expanded \nin red and blue States in response to a deadly pandemic. That was \nbefore we had vaccines, and COVID was killing an average of 1,200 \nAmericans a day. Yet they voted. Tens of millions of Americans stood in \nline, some for hours, to cast their ballots. That is how important the \nAmerican people thought it was to vote in 2020.\n  People risked their lives to cast their ballots. It is hard to \nbelieve that fact could be measured against statements made by the \nRepublican leader just a few moments ago that people don't care about \nthe right to vote. They care enough to risk their lives, and they did \nin the 2020 election.\n  Despite the crush of voters and the confusion of the pandemic, the \n2020 election was judged ``the most secure in American history.'' That \nis not my opinion; that is the official statement issued by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \nSecurity Agency under the Trump administration, an Agency which \ncoordinates the Nation's top cybersecurity and voting infrastructure \nsecurity. They released their assessment 10 days after the 2020 \nelection, and they did so to counter a dangerous and unprecedented \navalanche of misinformation--including from an enraged and defeated \nPresident--claiming falsely the election had been stolen.\n  These nonpartisan election security experts were not alone in \nrejecting Donald Trump's Big Lie. President Trump and his loyalists \nfiled more than 60 lawsuits in State and Federal courts, repeating \ntheir false claims of voter fraud and stolen votes. They offered no \nevidence to back their claims--only bizarre conspiracy theories and \nfar-right internet gossip. Their lawsuits were overwhelmingly \ndismissed, some by judges whom President Trump himself had nominated. \nThe former President exerted extraordinary pressure on the Department \nof Justice--we found that in the Senate Judiciary Committee and through \nother sources--and he failed.\n  When he couldn't bully the courts or the Justice Department to do his \nbidding, he summoned his mob. We all know personally about the death \nand destruction the Big Lie brought to this building on January 6, a \nyear ago. We lived through it. The Capitol survived it. The entire \nworld recoiled at the sight of Americans, goaded by the former \nPresident, attacking the heart of our democracy.\n  The Big Lie is corroding Americans' faith in our elections. In a \nrecent poll, two-thirds of Republicans--two-thirds of Republicans--\nsurveyed agreed with the false claim that ``voter fraud helped Joe \nBiden win the 2020 election''--two-thirds of Republicans. That poll \nalso found that 64 percent of Americans believe that U.S. democracy is \n``in crisis and at risk of failing.''\n  Senator McConnell dismisses this conversation, but the American \npeople know it is deadly serious.\n  In another poll, only one in three Republicans said that they trust \nthat the 2024 elections will be fair regardless of who wins--only one \nin three Republicans.\n  Donald Trump would rather destroy American democracy than admit he \nlost the election, and sadly, it seems that many Republican lawmakers \nwould rather repeat his lies than face his wrath.\n  Republican lawmakers of many States are using the Big Lie as a \npretext to pass new laws aimed at undermining both Americans' right to \nvote and the integrity of our elections. Sadly, Republicans in the \nSenate are aiding and abetting this attack. Three times last year, the \nRepublicans used the filibuster--the weapon of choice in the Jim Crow \nera--to block this Senate from even debating voting rights.\n  Each morning, we stand and pledge allegiance to that flag and what it \nrepresents, but I don't believe any Senator stands to pledge allegiance \nto the filibuster.\n  The filibuster is a rules creation in the Senate which really has \nstopped\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nmany important pieces of legislation from being considered. It was \nreally the major reason in the 1960s that the Voting Rights Act and \nother civil rights legislation took so long. I know personally five \ntimes I have brought to the floor the Dream Act to give young people in \nthis country a chance for a path to citizenship, and five times on the \nfloor of the Senate, it has been stopped by that same filibuster.\n  We have heard lofty rhetoric from the Republican leader about what \nthe filibuster means in the Senate. It has been used perhaps in \nconstructive ways, but it has certainly been used time and again for a \ndestructive purpose.\n  In the year since January 6, Republican legislatures in nearly 20 \nStates have enacted laws making it harder for Americans to vote and, in \nsome cases, easier for partisan actors to potentially meddle and \ninterfere with elections.\n  In total, more than 440 bills with voting restrictions have been \nintroduced in 49 States, and Senator McConnell can't see one example of \nvoter suppression.\n  Let me give you some examples so you know what we are speaking of.\n  We have heard this from Senators Warnock and Ossoff about the State \nof Georgia, a new law making it a crime to give a voter waiting in line \nto vote a snack or a drink of water--a crime to give a drink of water \nto someone waiting in line.\n  As Senator Booker reminded us yesterday, these long lines many times \nare populated by members of minority populations. What a coincidence \nthat they are the ones with too few voting machines or polling places \nand have to wait many times for hours to exercise their franchise.\n  In Texas, as a result of a new law known as S.B. 1, local election \nofficials all over the State are reporting they are being forced to \nreject hundreds of absentee ballot requests for the State's upcoming \nMarch primary.\n  In Denton County, Texas officials have had to reject over 40 percent \nof absentee ballot requests. In Travis County, nearly a third of mail \nballot applications have been rejected. Making matters worse, this new \nlaw makes it a felony in Texas for an election official in Texas to \nsend an unsolicited mail ballot application to a voter.\n  In Florida, Republican Governor DeSantis last week proposed creating \na police unit that would be empowered to arrest voters and others who \nallegedly violate the State's election laws. This is straight out of \nthe Jim Crow playbook.\n  In addition, Republican lawmakers in at least 10 States have \ndiminished secretaries of states' authorities over elections or shifted \naspects of the administration to partisan bodies, including State \nlegislators themselves or election boards dominated by the Republican \nParty.\n  A new law in Arkansas now grants the State Board of Election \nCommissioners--made of up five Republicans and one Democrat--police \npowers to investigate complaints about violation of the State's \nelection laws despite no evidence--none--of widespread voter fraud in \nthe State. It empowers the board to upend the State's traditional \ncounty-based election administration.\n  A new law in Arizona specifies that Democratic secretary of state, \nKatie Hobbs, can no longer represent the State in lawsuits defending \nthe election code. That power now lies with the attorney general, who \nhappens to be Republican--but only through January 2, 2023, when Katie \nHobbs' term in office ends.\n  Even more chilling, Republican lawmakers in a number of States have \nintroduced or passed new laws criminalizing aspects of election \nadministration.\n  In Wisconsin, the election administrators could face criminal \npenalties for correcting mistakes on a voter's mail-in ballot. Voting \nrights experts fear that such laws could leave nonpartisan election \nadministrators and workers forever looking over their shoulders or \ncause them to quit or be replaced by those who are less experienced and \nmore partisan.\n  So why is this happening? As I mentioned earlier, the 2020 election \nhad incredible turnout. According to the Census Bureau, 67 percent of \nall eligible Americans reported voting, and the majority clearly voted \nfor President Joe Biden. So now Republican lawmakers are using the Big \nLie to pass partisan election laws in order to reduce voter turnout and \ncontrol outcomes of the elections this year and in 2024. Their target? \nDemocratic voters. And their goal? Sow the seeds of doubt in our \ndemocracy and the credibility of future elections.\n  Republicans refuse to join us in protecting voting rights. Why? \nBecause the agenda they are following was set by Donald Trump, and \ndissenters pay a price. If you don't endorse--if you endorse, rather, \nthe Big Lie, he will endorse you; if you don't, he will unleash his \nfury.\n  These attacks on voting rights are shaking the pillars of our \ndemocracy, the credibility of our elections, and the peaceful transfer \nof power.\n  The vast majority of our Republican colleagues are all singing from \nthe same hymnal. They say there is no new wave of voter suppression and \nelection nullification laws. They are wrong.\n  They claim that our proposals to restore the Voting Rights Act and \nset minimum Federal standards for elections amount to an \n``unprecedented takeover of State elections and a partisan power \ngrab.'' They are wrong.\n  Each of us in our desks has this common document that guides us, I \nhope, in all of our actions on the Senate floor. Despite statements to \nthe contrary, we know that this document is explicit in what we are \nsetting out to do today.\n  The elections clause of the Constitution, article I, section 4, gives \nCongress the authority to make election laws. The 14th and 15th \nAmendments give Congress the responsibility to protect voting ``by \nappropriate legislation.''\n  The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized and strengthened five times, \nalways with a strong, bipartisan majority. The last time it was \nreauthorized was 2006, 7 years before Shelby County. That decision of \nthe Supreme Court, we know, gutted the law's protections. The Senate \nvoted unanimously, Democrats and Republicans, to reauthorize and \nstrengthen the law. Sixteen current Republican Members of the Senate \nvoted yes. It wasn't a Federal takeover of elections then, it isn't \nnow, and they know it.\n  I am the person chosen by Senate Democrats to count votes, and based \non their public statements, two Democrats may not vote to change the \nrules to allow this Congress to stop this power grab by Republican \nState lawmakers. These Senators have given their reasons. But there is \nsomething more important than an existing Senate rule--a rule that has \nbeen changed 160 times in the history of this body. The integrity of \nour free elections, the right to have your vote counted, and our oath \nto uphold and defend the Constitution I believe count for more.\n  On January 6, after the insurrection was quelled, we returned to the \nSenate to complete our constitutional duty of certifying the election \nand declaring Joe Biden President.\n  Speaking to the few Members of his party who still intended to \nchallenge the electoral count on the feeble grounds that some of their \nconstituents had doubts about the election, the junior Senator from \nUtah, Senator Romney, said: ``The best way you can show respect for the \nvoters who are upset about this is to tell them the truth.''\n  Then something happened on the floor of the Senate which rarely \noccurs: Senators on both sides of the aisle rose to their feet and gave \nSenator Romney a standing ovation. Do you remember it? I do.\n  It is time to remember that courage. It is time to tell the voters \nthe truth. Stop repeating the Big Lie that is tearing this country \napart. It is time for the Senate to pass the Voting Rights Act and the \nFreedom to Vote Act. To restore the power of the Voting Rights Act is \nto restore the promise of America.\n  I would like to close by reminding us that, earlier this week, we \nmarked Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. I saw many tweets from Members of \nthis Chamber celebrating his legacy.\n  One Republican leader tweeted: ``Nearly 60 years since the March on \nWashington, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s message echoes as powerfully \nas it did that day. His legacy inspires us to celebrate and keep \nbuilding upon the remarkable progress our great nation has made toward \nbecoming a more perfect union.''\n  Well, I certainly have good news for that Republican leader who sent \nthat\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\ntweet. He has an opportunity today to keep building on that remarkable \nprogress.\n  Instead of building on Dr. King's work, we have watched Republicans \nand State legislatures across the country choose to tear down that \nremarkable progress and make it harder to vote and make it harder to \neven acknowledge and teach the brutal history of the civil rights \nmovement and the systemic inequities that still exist.\n  So here are the questions for Members in this Chamber today: Are we \ngoing to live up today--this day, Wednesday--to the values we claimed \non Monday, Martin Luther King Day? Are we going to be inspired to \nactually listen to the message of Dr. King and why he risked his life \nto deliver it? Are you going to keep building upon the legacy and \nprogress that he fought to achieve?\n  For all of us on both sides of the aisle who quoted Dr. King on \nMonday, I implore you to listen to what he said in an interview in 1963 \nwhen asked about President Kennedy's civil rights bill. He said: ``I \nthink the tragedy is that we have a Congress with a Senate that has a \nminority of misguided senators who will use the filibuster to keep a \nmajority of people from even voting. They won't let the majority of \nsenators vote. And certainly they wouldn't want the majority of people \nto vote, because they know they do not represent the majority of the \nAmerican people. In fact, they represent, in their own states, a very \nsmall minority.''\n  Let's listen to Dr. King. Let's stop using the filibuster to kill \nlegislation to protect Americans' fundamental right to participate in \nour democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lujan). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later today, we expect the Democrat leader \nto force a vote on undermining the filibuster in hopes of forcing \nthrough a Federal election takeover to give his party an advantage in \nfuture elections. Make no mistake about it, that is what we are talking \nabout--federalizing elections in this country; usurping, preempting \nStates, where elections have been administered and regulated since the \ninception of this country.\n  The method--the method--that you are talking about using to do it \nwill literally undermine and blow up everything the Senate was supposed \nto be.\n  Now, you can say that the filibuster is used to prevent or block \nthings from happening, and that may be true. You have done it. We have \ndone it. Used a 60-vote threshold last week to stop a bipartisan Russia \nsanctions bill from passing in the U.S. Senate. Both sides have done \nit. But the filibuster is representative and symbolic of something much \nlarger, and that is, the very essence of what the Senate is about.\n  I want to read for you from the Federalist Papers because there has \nbeen a lot of quoting of the Founding Fathers over here today.\n  This is what the author of Federalist 62 notes:\n\n       [A] senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly, \n     distinct from, and dividing power with, a first, must be in \n     all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the \n     security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two \n     distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . . .\n       Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated \n     by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to \n     yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to \n     be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and \n     pernicious resolutions.\n\n  To go on, the author of Federalist 62:\n\n       [A] continual change even of good measures is inconsistent \n     with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success.\n       In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence \n     of other nations, and all the advantages connected with \n     national character.\n       The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more \n     calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It \n     will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made \n     by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that \n     they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be \n     understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are \n     promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, \n     who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be \n     to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can \n     that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen, our Founders created this institution to be \nseparate and distinct from the House of Representatives for a reason. \nAnd what you are talking about doing today is turning the U.S. Senate \ninto a majoritarian body no different--no different--from the House of \nRepresentatives except with longer terms and, some people would argue, \nbigger egos. That is what we are talking about doing. They won't need \nus. Yes, we have longer terms; they are staggered. But the essence of \nthe Senate is a check and balance on the passions of the other body, \nand there is a reason why the Founders created it.\n  Now, I represent a red State, South Dakota. I am not a racist, nor \nare the people whom I know in the State of South Dakota. Our State \nlegislature, like most States' legislatures, pretty much every year \ncomes up with ideas. Some of them--a few of them--not most, but a few \nget enacted into law. A lot of them end up on the cutting room floor, \nwhich is where most legislative ideas end up. And there are some crazy \nones.\n  I would argue we have some crazy ones coming out of here. There are \nsome pretty crazy bills that get introduced around here, most of which, \ngladly, never make it into law.\n  But in South Dakota, our legislature meets every year, like most \nlegislatures, introduces a bunch of bills, acts on them, conducts \nhearings, and moves them through the legislative process. Some become \nenacted and signed into law; most don't. One of the bills that did get \nsigned into law was a bill that created a photo ID to vote. It was \npassed in 2003. It has worked well in South Dakota. People support it, \nnot just in South Dakota but across the country. And after passing in \n2003, the 2004 election had the largest turnout in modern history, at \nleast for the years for which we have that kind of information \navailable, as 78.6 percent of people voted in the 2004 election after--\nafter--2003, when the South Dakota legislature passed a photo ID law.\n\n  Now, I think there are some ideas out there that are pretty bad, and \nI am not one who is here to dispute the 2020 election. The 2020 \nelection is over. It has been decided. It was the largest turnout since \n1900. It was the largest turnout in 120 years, which is why you all are \narguing that these States are going in and changing things to prevent \nhigh turnout. Well, in most of the States that I have seen--at least \nthat I can tell--the legislation that I have looked at that have been \npassed and enacted are things that in most cases people would say: \nWell, yeah, that is probably within the purview of the State \nlegislature.\n  The State of Georgia, for example, in terms of days in which you can \nearly vote, actually has more early voting--more early voting, more \npermissive early voting--than the State of New York or the State of \nDelaware, the President's home State. There is no-excuse absentee \nvoting. We have that in South Dakota. We have a long period for \nabsentee voting or early voting in South Dakota, much longer than what \nwe are talking about here. In a red State, the State legislature \ndecided that, thought it made sense. But no-excuse absentee voting is \nsomething that we do in South Dakota, something that is allowed for in \nGeorgia but is not in the State of New York or the State of Delaware, \nbecause the States decide it, as it should be.\n  About standing in line and giving people things while they are \nstanding in line to vote, the State of South Dakota has a law against \nthat, too. It is called electioneering. It is called electioneering. \nNow, there isn't anything that I understand of Georgia law that doesn't \nprevent an election worker from going out and giving somebody a glass \nof water or something to eat. There isn't anything that says that 150 \nfeet away--which is 50 yards--50 yards away, you can't feed people \nlunch. All it says is, when somebody is standing in line, that \npolitical operatives shouldn't be electioneering, going out and handing \nthings out to induce people to vote a certain way.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, don't blow up the U.S. Senate and everything \nthat the Founders intended the Senate to be about over an issue that, \nfor all intents and purposes--and you can say it is not--but it is \nfederalizing our elections. It is taking power away from States to make \nthe laws that govern our elections.\n  And thank God in 2020 the States did things the right way. The States \ncertified on time, in accordance with the law, the 2020 election. And \nif we hadn't\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nhad that, if we had sucked all that power up here to Washington, DC, \nand centralized our elections, what do you think would have happened?\n  I mean, I think there is a reason why we have a decentralized system, \nand I think it makes sense for a country as big as ours, particularly \nat a time when we are worrying about other countries hacking our \nelections. It is a lot harder to hack 50 States than it is one computer \nsystem here in Washington, DC. But that is what we are talking about, \nand you can't sugar coat it. You can disguise it and you can say it is \nJim Crow 2.0 and all that, but it is federalizing elections in this \ncountry and taking power directly away from the States.\n  I lost my first Senate election back in 2002. I was ahead on \nWednesday morning. Tuesday night and Wednesday came and went. On \nWednesday morning, I was sitting in my living room in Sioux Falls, SD, \nwatching the television, and I watched my 3,300 vote lead become a 524 \nvote deficit, like that because one precinct came in from one of the \nReservation counties in South Dakota, and they voted 94 percent--93 \npercent--against me, and I lost that election. And I had all these \npeople, all of these smart political minds around the country and in \nSouth Dakota, say: You have to contest it. There are irregularities. \nYou know there are irregularities.\n  I thought about it, and we did a little bit of looking into it, but, \na day later, I decided to say the election was over. I lost that first \nelection. And you know what, that is what happens. Sometimes we win; \nsometimes we lose.\n  What you all are trying to do here is create a system, it seems to \nme, at least, where you give your side a permanent advantage. And I \ndon't--I mean, that is your prerogative. If you want to do this, that \nis fine in terms of having the issue and talking about it. But the one \nthing I just fundamentally disagree with is how you are proposing to do \nit--to literally do away with everything the Senate was designed and \ncreated to be by our Founders and has served a purpose very, very well, \nand you all did it the last session of Congress. You filibustered \nnumerous coronavirus bills. You filibustered police reform. You \nfilibustered pro-life legislation, and then go down the list. And like \nI said, you used the 60-vote threshold last week to keep a Russia \nsanctions bill--a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill, I might add--from \npassing the Senate.\n\n  And you can go on and look at all the statements you have all made \nthrough the years, and I am not going to repeat them, because you heard \nthem over and over again. But I think it is important to remember one \nthing, and that is, when you make statements like that, they do have a \nshelf life. And some of that shelf life is pretty short, because it was \njust a few years ago, in some cases 3, 4 years ago; in some cases, 1 \nyear ago, 2 years ago.\n  A lot of you have statements publicly, clearly out there, defending \nthe filibuster: Doing away with it would be doomsday for democracy; \nturn America into a banana republic.\n  Don't do it. I am just saying, don't do it. There has got to be \nsomebody over there who gets this. I mean, we had the pressure to do \nthis. You know that. Thirty-four times, our President in the last \nadministration--34 times--tweeted publicly, demanded that Republicans \nget rid of the filibuster, and we resisted it. And I have had people in \nthe media ask me. And I have heard that your side is saying, too: Well, \nthe Democrats, you know, if we don't do it now, Republicans will do it.\n  No, we are not going to do it--not if you don't. If you do, then \nsure, then all bets are off. And then the Senate becomes the House of \nRepresentatives and policy changes every 2 years or 4 years, depending \non who is in power. There is no stability. There is no predictability. \nThere is no moderation, and there is no incentive for this body to work \ntogether across the aisle. That changes permanently.\n  I hope that doesn't happen because I don't think that is what we \nshould be about--certainly not what we should be about. But that is \nwhere this is headed if--if--if you move forward, if you change the \nrules, overthrow the rules to do this.\n  Mr. President, we are better than this. Our country is better than \nthis. Our Founders created a system that was designed to provide that \nmoderation, provide that continuity, to provide that stability, to \nprovide that predictability in a way that what is being talked about \ntoday would completely destroy and undermine, not only in the near term \nbut permanently--because you can't do this once. You can't turn this \noff. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Once you do this, it \nis a new state of play in the U.S. Senate, and that is a whole new \nworld, not just for us but for the people we represent, for our Nation \nand for the world.\n  I hope and pray that there are enough wise Democrats on your side \nthat will join with all of us to resist the pressure that you are \nfeeling, like we did when our President came to us and said you have to \ndo this. We aren't going to do it because we understand what it means, \nand you should too.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here on this momentous day for our \ncountry, and I would like to address some of the remarks from my friend \nand neighbor from the State of South Dakota. I hope he will stay for my \nremarks.\n  What is the Senate about? That is what Senator Thune was just \naddressing. What is the Senate about? We come here to represent the \npeople of our States, and we come here to make decisions and to vote. I \ndon't think anyone in our States wants us to come here and hug an \narchaic tradition and then simply stop votes, stop debates; hug that \ntradition tight and then throw the voters under the desk and go home \nand raise money; because, basically, that is what this tradition has \nturned into.\n  I believe what our Founding Fathers wanted when it became clear that \nthis country was forming, they wanted to have a Senate that worked. And \nwhen you go back and look, there is no mention about filibuster in the \nConstitution. There is no mention of 60 votes. There is no mention of \ncloture. Rules developed over time. And believe it or not, to my friend \nfrom South Dakota, those rules changed with the times. In the words of \nSenator Byrd, someone who believed in the traditions of this place, the \nrules change with the circumstances. And in the words of our \nConstitution, which the Senator from South Dakota failed to mention, \n``The Times, Places and Manner of . . . Elections''--well, this is what \nit says: ``Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such \nRegulations.''\n  That is what it says. It was very, very clear, at the beginning of \nthis country, that it was anticipated that the Congress would have a \nrole in these elections. Why? Because they are Federal elections.\n  And now before us--before us--is the freedom to vote, something that \nhas been a long and hard fought battle in our country's history. And \ntoday we continue that march toward justice in the Senate because we \nface a coordinated and relentless campaign to limit Americans' \nconstitutional right to vote.\n  As President Biden said last week--I was honored to be there with him \nand Vice President Harris in Atlanta. As he said, ``This is the test of \nour time.''\n  There are moments in the life of our Nation, like when a bomb blew up \nthe 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and four little girls were \nmurdered; like when John Lewis and so many others were bloodied as they \ncrossed that bridge in Selma--there are moments in time when things \nstand still.\n  And make no mistake, our country is at one of those moments right \nnow. It is no coincidence that after more Americans voted than in the \nhistory of this country in the 2020 election, that suddenly there was a \nslew--a flood--of State election laws meant to suppress the votes of \nAmericans.\n  It is not, as the minority leader just described, a fake panic. A \nfake panic? Let's see what is fake about this. What is fake about this \nlaw that passed in Georgia, where, suddenly, when 70,000 people \nregistered to vote during the runoff period--I would say to the \nminority leader if he were here, when 70,000 people registered to vote \nduring the runoff period--they changed that law. They reduced the time \nof the runoff period. They make it so no one can register during that \ntime. In Montana, 8,000 people availed themselves of\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nsame-day registration in the last election by either changing their \naddress because they moved or registering for the first time. What did \nthey do? That is it. That is not going to happen, even though it has \nbeen in place for 15 years, long before the pandemic.\n  That is not fake. There is nothing about that that is fake.\n  And when I think about the moment in time we are in now, I look back \nto that moment when Senator Blunt and I and Vice President Pence--the \nlast ones remaining in this Chamber, with two young women holding the \nmahogany box with the last of the electoral ballots through W, Wyoming. \nAt 3:30 in the morning, as we took that long walk over to the House of \nRepresentatives--that walk that had been so joyful just that \nmorning. That glass, broken on the sides of that wall, that was not \nfake. The statues covered in spray paint, that was not fake. That was \nreal--just as real as the fact that over 440 bills, since that fateful \nday, have been introduced to restrict voting, and 30 of these bills \nhave been signed into law in 19 States. What is happening in States \nlike Florida, Georgia, and Texas, with their omnibus bills, that is \nvery real.\n\n  The voters--they know it is real. Last summer, when we took the Rules \nCommittee on a field hearing--joined by Senator Ossoff, who is a member \nof the committee, and Senator Reverend Warnock, who has taken on this \ntorch in his State and across the country--we met a veteran, living in \ncentral Georgia. He told us how he took his older neighbors to vote \nearly, but they had to give up and go home after seeing the line \nwrapped around the block, and when he later went back to vote, he had \nto wait, himself, for 3 hours in the hot Sun.\n  That is not fake, I say to the minority leader. That is real.\n  This guy is a veteran. He served in the Air Force during Operation \nDesert Storm. When I asked him if he had to wait in line when he signed \nup to serve, he said no. But when he came home and wanted to vote in an \nelection in the United States of America, he had to wait in the hot Sun \nhour after hour, after hour.\n  When the minority leader said that no American deserved to have his \nvoice silenced, as he just said in this Chamber--those long lines, one \nballot box in the middle of Harris County, TX, with over 5 million \npeople, which would be like putting one ballot box in the middle of my \nentire State--then what are those laws about? Silencing people. That is \nwhat it is about.\n  When we were in Atlanta, we also heard from Helen Butler, a former \nelections official for a rural county, who told us how she was ousted \nby the Republicans in the State legislature after over a decade of \nservice, which the new law makes even easier to do by stripping power \naway from local officials and, ultimately, putting it in the hands of \nthe State legislature. They are messing around, my friends, with the \nvery counting of the votes, with proposals made in Wisconsin, with \nproposals made in other States.\n  One Montana woman, living on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, had \nopen heart surgery a week before the 2020 election and relied on a \nTribal assistance provider to return her ballot, but under another new \nlaw, the assistance she received is now banned. These are real, and \nthese are real people.\n  It is voters who were made to stand in the rain, in homemade masks \nand garbage bags, at the beginning of the pandemic, just to exercise \ntheir right to vote. It is veterans standing in hot lines in the Sun in \nGeorgia. It is a voter in a wheelchair in Texas being forced to travel \n3 hours and take 4 buses roundtrip to reach a ballot drop-off box. It \nis a voter in Arizona being told that she didn't receive her mail-in \nballot for the State's primary because she had been marked as an \ninactive voter even though she had just cast her ballot in the \nPresidential primary.\n  It is five States--Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and \nTexas--still telling over 30 million--30 million--Americans, registered \nvoters, that they cannot request a mail-in ballot during a pandemic \nwithout an approved excuse. That is why it is on us, with the support \nof the Constitution, to take action. As I noted at the beginning of my \nremarks, it was, in fact, anticipated in the Constitution with that \nclause that empowers Congress to make or alter rules for Federal \nelections.\n  What does the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act do?\n  It sets basic Federal standards to ensure that Americans can \nparticipate in the franchise. It guarantees at least 2 weeks of early \nvoting, like voters now have in two-thirds of States, including red \nStates. It provides for same-day registration, like they had for 15 \nyears in Montana. It allows all voters to request a mail-in ballot, \nwithout an excuse, and ensures voters do not need to provide witness \nsignatures or notarizations of notary publics, whom they would have to \nhire, on mail-in ballots because, if you are in South Carolina right \nnow and you want to cast a mail-in ballot and you have COVID or you are \nin a hospital, you have to have a witness sign off on that ballot. It \nalso makes your voters have access to drop boxes.\n  The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would also include much needed \nprotections against those seeking to undermine our elections. Senator \nBlunt and I held a bipartisan hearing this last year, and we found out \nthat nearly one in three local elections officials feels unsafe because \nof the job, and nearly one in six has received threats of violence.\n  The Republican Kentucky secretary of state said that, if something \ndoesn't happen, they are not going to have enough people to work at \nelections. Now, he didn't agree with what we were going to do, but he \ndid note that they no longer have enough volunteers to work their \npolls.\n  A Republican Philadelphia city commissioner who did want to see \nlegislation passed, Al Schmidt, told us about the threats--he is no \nlonger in his job--he received as a result of his work of simply \ncounting the ballots. He told us--I see the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhere--that his family's names, his kids' names have been put out on the \ninternet as well as his address, a picture of his house, and a message, \nsaying: Tell the truth or your three kids will be fatally shot.\n  Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs told us she received a \nmessage: I am a hunter, and I think you should be hunted.\n  These are not just 1-point examples. Over 9,000 Members of Congress \nhave received threats--double, triple. This is according to the Capitol \nPolice, in numbers that we have never seen before.\n  So, no, I say to the minority leader. This is not fake. This is not \none big fake. It calls for Federal action. Yes, I am disappointed that \nfour times our colleagues have voted down allowing us to go forward \nwith the Freedom to Vote Act or the John Lewis bill, which are now \ncombined into one. With the exception of Senator Murkowski, who did \nallow for the debate to continue on one of the bills, the John Lewis \nbill, no one stood up and joined us in allowing for a debate on these \nbills--no one. So that is why we are here.\n\n  I say to Senator Thune: The reason we are looking to restore the \nrules of the Senate is that there is no other way to move forward to \nguarantee Americans the right to vote. In the past, this was \nbipartisan. In 2006, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized under \nPresident George W. Bush by a vote of 98 to 0--98 to 0--but that is, \nsadly, not where we are today.\n  When it comes to the rules of the Senate--and I am not going to \nbelabor this, as I see my friend Senator Merkley of Oregon, who is a \nhistorical expert on all of this--I will say this: There are 160 \nexceptions--160 exceptions--to the filibuster rule. Things have been \nchanged to benefit my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nSomehow, it only took 51 votes to put in place the Trump tax cuts or \nthe Bush tax cuts. Somehow, it only took 51 votes to put Amy Coney \nBarrett on the Supreme Court of the United States--a change by them, \nmade by them. Somehow, it only takes 51 votes to try to overturn a \nregulation or to try to mess around with the Affordable Care Act.\n  But then, when it comes to something like voting rights, suddenly, \neveryone on the other side of the aisle is hugging that filibuster \ntight, knowing that, in so many times in history, including most \nrecently with the debt ceiling, changes have been made to allow a vote \nwith less than 60 votes: the National Gas Policy Act in 1977; in 1995, \nthe Endangered Species Act; in\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n1996, a change to the reconciliation process--160 times.\n  And, as Representative Clyburn pointed out so well, there have been \ntimes in our history when that most sacrosanct of rights has been \nextended or defended--the right to vote--on a bipartisan basis, like \nwith the 15th Amendment. But we know, as he said, that that was a \nsingle-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote, and that \nfact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.\n  During the past week, so many in this Chamber celebrated the life of \nMartin Luther King, but let us not forget what he stood for. He did not \nstand for the filibuster. He didn't like it. As Reverend Warnock has \npointed out so many times, he stood for action and fairness and \nfreedom.\n  Last week, I met with Martin Luther King III and his wife and \ndaughter, who came to Washington to help us pass this legislation. They \ntold me that their daughter was born in 2008, the year that President \nObama was elected. They told me how the Supreme Court's Shelby County \ndecision was issued 5 years later, followed by Georgia's anti-voting \nlaw, enacted just last year. How sad is it that, if we do not act, \ntheir daughter--the granddaughter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--and \nher classmates will face more obstacles in voting, in casting a ballot, \nthan the promise that they were born with? This cannot be the democracy \nthat our children inherit.\n  Dr. King once said--and I will paraphrase--that disappointment is \nfinite. I don't know how today is going to end, but if it ends without \nthis bill's passing, we will be much less of a country moving forward. \nYet I will keep this in mind, what he said: Disappointment is finite, \nbut hope is infinite.\n  The people of this country will not tolerate, as the minority leader \nhas said, the silencing of their voices. Truly, I think, by voting this \ndown, by not allowing us to even debate this to get to the conclusion \nof a vote, that this is silencing the people of America--all in the \nname of an archaic Senate rule that isn't even in the Constitution. \nThat is just wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, just 14 months ago, our Nation stood on \nthe brink of a constitutional crisis as the former President and his \nfollowers attempted to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power and \noverturn the results of a free and fair election.\n  Instead of accepting the will of the voters in upholding the \nfoundations of our constitutional Republic, President Trump and his \nfollowers engaged in a campaign of blatant disinformation and political \ninterference. They attempted to coerce State and local election \nofficials to make false claims of widespread fraud and then use those \nclaims to not certify election results and reject the will of the \npeople--all to ensure that the former President could stay in power at \nany cost.\n  My home State of Michigan was at the very center of this battle in \n2020 when our State Board of Canvassers met to certify the undeniable \nfact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had won the State of Michigan and \nits 16 electoral votes, but we came dangerously close to the kind of \nanti-democratic and authoritarian behavior that the United States has \nlong decried in other nations.\n  It basically came down to one vote--just one vote--from one \nRepublican member of the Board of Canvassers--one canvasser who dared \nto withstand the intense political pressure for him to ignore the will \nof the people and to not certify those election results, one canvasser \nwho chose to ignore blatant lies and disinformation. His one vote was \nall that stood between a secure, free, and fair election and a \nconstitutional crisis. This one Republican board member knew his \ndecision to follow the law would cost him the position on that board. \nHe knew that his physical safety would be threatened, and it was. Yet \nhe stood his ground. He fulfilled his constitutional duty and followed \nthe will of the people of the State of Michigan by voting to certify \nthose results.\n  So what was his reward for his courageous vote? Well, the Republicans \nremoved him from the board, sending a very clear message and a threat \nto all of those who will follow him.\n  Despite failing to coerce enough officials to ignore the law and \nfalsify election results and despite losing one bogus challenge after \nanother in the Federal courts, we all know that the former President \ndidn't stop his efforts there--no. Instead, he rallied his supporters \nand incited them to attack the U.S. Capitol Building--the very citadel \nof our democracy--to disrupt Congress as we conducted the ceremonial \ncertification of the results. But thanks to the brave actions of law \nenforcement officers, the National Guard, and so many others, our \ndemocracy withstood these unprecedented attacks on our constitutional \nRepublic.\n  This attack shook the very foundation of our democracy. It exposed \ncracks that show that it is more fragile than we ever thought was \npossible.\n  Despite all of this, I believe that we need to celebrate the fact \nthat the 2020 Presidential election was secure, according to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the FBI. We should celebrate that \nwe had record turnout even in a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. We should \ncommend the election workers who made this incredible feat possible. \nInstead, too many people, including too many of my Republican \ncolleagues, have continued to sow doubt in the integrity of our \nelection process, and these actions threaten the very bedrock of our \ndemocracy.\n  Instead of condemning falsehoods and violence, there is a concerted \neffort underway in Michigan and all across our country to rewrite \nhistory, remove election officials, and rewrite State laws to limit \nvoter participation.\n  One of the bills that were introduced in the Michigan Legislature \nwould lock up--would lock up--absentee drop boxes before election day. \nOne Republican city clerk called this idea crazy and said it makes no \nsense whatsoever. I agree. Another bill would restrict the ability of \nState election officials to send out absentee ballot applications to \nvoters. In fact, Michigan Republicans filed 39 bills in the State \nlegislature to restrict voting rights.\n  Nothing less than the very future of our democracy is at stake, and \nwe must act or risk losing what so many Americans have fought for and \nhave died for for nearly 250 years. The right to vote, the right to \nself-governance, the right of the American people to choose and fire \npublic officials is our Nation's fundamental freedom. We can protect \nthat right and ensure every American has equal access to the ballot \nbox, and we can do it by simply passing two bills that are before us.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act will protect the rights of voters by \nfacilitating registration, early voting, and vote-by-mail. It will set \na standard to ensure that every citizen in every State has guaranteed \nrights. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act takes additional \nsteps to address the practices that have historically been used to \ndiscriminate against voters simply based on their race.\n  Despite some of the Republican arguments that I have already heard \ntoday, the Constitution is very clear. We have heard that from article \nI of the Constitution, and many times, Congress has continued to \nstrengthen the voting rights of individuals.\n  The 15th Amendment clearly states that the right of citizens cannot \nbe abridged by a State and clearly states that ``Congress shall have \nthe power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'' That is \njust what Congress has done in passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nthe Help America Vote Act, and the National Voter Registration Act. \nCongress has done this in the past. We need to do it again.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support these commonsense \nmeasures, and they deserve to know where we stand. For that reason, \nafter every Senator has had a chance to speak, the debate must come to \nan end, and we must have an up-or-down vote on these bills.\n  I believe history will not be kind to the colleagues of mine who \nstand in the way of democracy.\n  Make no mistake about it, we are at a pivotal moment in our Nation's \nhistory. Our democratic Republic and our most treasured values are in \ndanger. If we fail to act, we may lose it.\n  I proudly stand on the side of democracy, and I urge my colleagues to \nstand with me in passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis \nVoting Rights Advancement Act.\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, families in Texas and across the country \nare being pummeled by the highest inflation in 40 years. For everything \nfrom gasoline to groceries, to clothing, to utility bills, basic \nexpenses have skyrocketed.\n  Groceries just don't cost more, they are also harder to find. Empty \nshelves have become a sign of the times as supply chain problems, \nstaffing shortages, and severe weather have created a perfect storm.\n  On top of that, families are trying to stay safe and healthy in the \nmidst of a surge in COVID-19 cases. There is an urgent need for testing \nand masks, both of which are increasingly hard to come by.\n  With so many urgent needs facing families in Texas and elsewhere, \nwhat does the Democratic leadership have teed up for the Senate this \nweek? A partisan bill to take over the Nation's elections. Democrats \napparently want people to forget about the fact that they can't keep \ntheir refrigerators or pantries stocked or that their kids are out of \nschool again because of the pandemic and can't study in person or that \nit costs a small fortune to fill up your gas tank. Apparently, they are \ntrying to convince the American people that there is somehow a \ncoordinated assault on the right to vote and their partisan legislation \nis the only savior.\n  According to our colleagues, the evidence of this attack can be found \nin a number of State laws passed this last year, even though many of \nthe reforms in those laws make voting easier than in a number of blue \nStates. The Georgia law, for example, extends the early voting period \nto 17 days, giving voters more time than what is offered in the \nPresident's home State of Delaware, which, until this year, did not \nallow any in-person early voting.\n  When that argument fails, though, our colleagues say the need for \nthis legislation stems from the attack on the Capitol on January 6, \neven though their bill was written long before a mob descended on this \nbuilding. In fact, the first version of the For the People Act was \nintroduced in 2019, more than 3 years ago.\n  The so-called voting rights crisis is nothing more than manufactured \nhysteria to justify our colleagues' longstanding attempts to take over \nAmerica's elections.\n  Just to put a timeframe around the concerns, this is what 94 percent \nof respondents to a Pew poll, a nonpartisan poll, said about the 2020 \nelections. Ninety-four percent said it was easy or very easy to cast \ntheir ballot. Yet the legislation that is going to be considered today \nhas its origins in a 2019 bill called the For the People Act, which \nobviously predates this poll from the Pew corporation.\n  While I have no doubt the Senate will reject this legislation once \nagain, I never cease to be amazed at how far our colleagues are willing \nto go to enhance their own political power purely along partisan lines. \nAs a matter of fact, they have done a complete about-face.\n  Less than 5 years ago, the majority leader said we should ``build a \nfirewall around the legislative filibuster.'' He has now laid the \ngroundwork and will call the vote to end it. The Democratic leader has \ntried to frame this radical move as a way to promote debate, but make \nno mistake, our colleagues aren't trying to blow up the Senate to force \nRepublicans to explain our opposition to the election takeover bill. In \nfact, we have done that endlessly. We don't need this drama in order to \nexplain our position. I, for one, have spent hours on the Senate floor \nexplaining the dangers of this partisan legislation, as have many of my \nother colleagues.\n  The only conclusion I can reach is that our Democratic colleagues are \ntrying to blow up the Senate in order to clear a path for purely \npartisan legislation, to take a body that was actually created to \npromote bipartisan consensus building and make it possible with purely \nDemocrat votes to work their will in a body that represents some 330 \nmillion Americans. What a bad idea that would be, to promote purely \npartisan legislation and dissuade or take away the incentives that \nencourage us to do what doesn't come naturally, and that is to actually \nwork together and build consensus.\n  Our colleagues apparently don't realize how shortsighted this move \nactually is. In the Senate, the door actually swings both ways. One \nday, you are in a majority. The next day, you are using every tool at \nyour disposal to have a say in the process while representing your \nconstituents.\n  No matter how much frustration and heartache the filibuster creates \nfor the majority party, the shoe is always capable of being on the \nother foot. Those of us who have been here a while have been in the \nmajority and in the minority and understand the frustration that a \nmajority feels when they can't get what they want while complying with \nthe Senate rules and the consensus-building requirement of the 60-vote \ncloture vote requirement.\n  But if our colleagues succeed in blowing up the filibuster, there is \nno question that it will be easier for them to turn their progressive \nwish list into the law of the land.\n  You can't just carve out one piece of legislation. Once we head down \nthat slippery slope, the legislative filibuster is gone.\n  Taking over America's elections may be the first item on their \nagenda, but it won't be the last. They could pass the Green New Deal \n2.0, impose sweeping gun control laws, legalize abortion from the time \nof conception until the time of natural delivery, and force every \nindividual in the country into a one-size-fits-all healthcare plan. \nThey could expand the Supreme Court and pack it with partisan Justices. \nThey could even add new States--Puerto Rico, Washington, DC--and add to \ntheir majority in the Senate while doing so.\n  There would be no limit, no constraint, not even a speed bump on what \nour Democratic colleagues could do if they created so-called carve-outs \nfor every bill they dub ``must-pass legislation.'' The entirety of the \nradical left's wish list could become law without having to gain a \nsingle Republican vote.\n  Of course, there is one big caveat here: Our Democratic colleagues \ncan only do that if they retain the majority. As our colleagues know, \npower is fleeting, and at some point, the shoe will always be on the \nother foot. The sign on Senator Schumer's door may say ``majority \nleader'' today, but that won't last forever. In a year, Republicans \ncould hold the majority in both the Senate and the House. Three years \nfrom today, we could have a Republican President-elect. I would like to \nask my colleagues, what happens then? When Republicans control the \nSenate, the House, and the White House, as Democrats do now, how would \nour colleagues feel about the new rule book that they have created? \nWill they stand by their decision to silence the minority and ignore \nthe millions of the people those Senators represent? Not a chance. If \nthe filibuster is eliminated, it doesn't just pave the way to our \nDemocratic colleagues' agenda; it clears the path for the majority's \nagenda, whichever party that may be.\n\n  Now, liberal activists may like the idea of nuking the filibuster \ntoday, but they will soon find themselves ruing the day their party \nbroke the Senate. The next Republican-controlled Senate could make the \n2017 tax cuts permanent and ensure that blue-State millionaires are \nrequired to pay their fair share of Federal taxes.\n  We could make sure that there would be investments in border security \nand immigration enforcement and craft reforms to reduce the immigration \ncourt backlog. We could withhold Federal funding from sanctuary cities \nand prioritize the deportation of violent criminals.\n  We could implement a 20-week ban on abortions and ensure that any \nbaby who survives an abortion receives lifesaving care. We could expand \nschool choice to give students and parents more options when it comes \nto a quality education. We could protect our constituents' Second \nAmendment rights and establish concealed carry reciprocity throughout \nthe Nation.\n  We could pass right-to-work laws, expand natural gas production, and \nmake even more investments in our national security.\n  In short, a future Republican-controlled Senate would be able to \naccomplish a lot, all thanks to a precedent that our Democratic \ncolleagues seek to establish today. And while I would love to see many \nof these bills that I just\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nmentioned become law, I oppose any effort to eliminate or weaken the \nlegislative filibuster, just as we did when we were in the majority \nworking with a Republican President during the preceding 4 years.\n  There is no scenario in which partisan wins are more important than \nlong-term stability for our laws and our public policy. It is not just \nthe American people who would experience whiplash under this game of \nping-pong. Imagine the chaos our economy would endure if laws were \nsimply changed every couple of years because a new majority comes into \nplace.\n  Without some degree of predictability, how could businesses, small \nand large alike, make investments that would pay off in the future and \ncreate more jobs and help grow our economy?\n  This is why we need the filibuster for every piece of legislation \nthat comes out of the Senate. The much derided 60-vote threshold is \nthere to ensure the stability of our country's laws and policies are \nnot affected by the transitory majorities that we find here in \nCongress.\n  I know the Democratic leader and many of our colleagues are moved to \naction by their political base, and some may actually be worried about \nhaving a primary opponent unless they go to the mat trying to eliminate \nthe filibuster. Well, some of our colleagues have experienced \nunbelievable pressure, particularly the Senator from West Virginia and \nthe Senator from Arizona. And last night, if the press reports are \naccurate, when asked whether the majority leader would support a \ncontested primary run against Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema, he \ndidn't respond. The Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, did respond \nand said he would consider supporting a primary opponent to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from Arizona. I would make the point \nthat it was the junior Senator from Vermont who made that statement, \nnot the Presiding Officer.\n  So, in the Democratic Party, if you can't vote your conscience \nanymore, you either have to fall in line or your colleagues will make \nevery effort to try to kick you out.\n  Well, I have some news for our friends across the aisle. If they \nthink liberal activists are upset now, they haven't seen anything yet \nbecause, if the majority leader successfully blows up the rules of the \nSenate, the radical left will have a full-on meltdown when Republicans \nregain the majority, which could be as soon as next year.\n  Regardless of which party holds the majority, the Senate rules should \nnot be bent or broken to achieve strictly partisan wins. Democrats' \nattempt to blow up the Senate is reckless and embarrassingly \nshortsighted. You wonder if anybody learned anything out of the debates \nand the nuclear option that was used strictly for judicial nominations, \nwhich resulted in three Republican nominees being confirmed to the \nSupreme Court during the last President's term of office.\n  Later today, all 100 Senators will go on the record. Each Member will \nvote on whether to silence 50 Senators and the tens of millions of \npeople that those of us in the majority represent. All of my Republican \ncolleagues support the filibuster, even when we have received a lot of \npressure--like the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from West \nVirginia have had--from people in their own political party, including \nthe President of the United States, because we have stood in favor of \nthat requirement because of the stabilizing force that it provides and, \nagain, forcing us to do something that doesn't necessarily come \nnatural, and that is to work together and build bipartisan consensus.\n  Don't get me wrong. It is hard, in this polarized country, to work \ntogether and find common ground, but it is essential that we continue \nto do so where we can. Our Democratic colleagues used to agree. In \nfact, it has been less than 5 years since 27 of our current Democratic \ncolleagues signed a letter arguing that the filibuster should be \npreserved. We will see if those colleagues and the many others who have \ndefended the filibuster end up caving to the radical left in their \npolitical base and vote to blow up the Senate.\n  For the sake of the American people, our economy, and the long-term \nstability of our government, I hope this ends up being another failed \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am so glad to be with my colleagues on \nthe floor on this most important day discussing a most important topic, \nand I want to say particularly that I am glad to follow my friend from \nTexas. The senior Senator from Texas is a friend. We have traveled \ntogether. We have legislated together. But friends can disagree, and on \nthis topic we disagree strongly.\n  Life throws ironies at us. The Senator from Texas inhabits the seat \nthat was held by Lyndon Baines Johnson--Lyndon Baines Johnson--the \ntowering figure who helped usher through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nI inhabit a seat that for years was called the Byrd seat in the Senate, \ninhabited for 50 years by Harry Byrd, Sr., and Harry Byrd, Jr., who \nwere known for their virulent efforts to deprive African Americans of \ncivil rights, including frequent extended filibusters on this floor \nagainst voting rights.\n  LBJ is held in high regard today because of his passion for voting \nrights.\n  Harry Byrd--I was at the State capitol in Richmond on Saturday to see \nour new Governor inaugurated, and I walked by the spot on the capitol \ngrounds where a Harry Byrd statue used to stand. It was removed 6 \nmonths ago. The Harry Byrd Middle School in Henrico County was renamed \n5 years ago to the Quioccasin Middle School.\n  The Harry Byrd, Jr. School of Business at the Shenandoah University \nin Winchester, their hometown, had that name stripped off the building \na few years ago.\n  And I stand to follow the Senator who holds LBJ's seat--the Senator \nfrom the Byrd seat--to today argue that the time has come for us to \nprotect voting rights.\n  I am just happy to be on the floor talking about a bill. I mean, for \ngosh sake, we have been able to talk about voting rights in the morning \nhour. Mr. Leader, I have been here since January of 2013. This is the \nfirst time since then that we have been able to get a bill on the floor \nto talk about voting rights.\n  And I am going to admit something to you guys that will not surprise \nyou because you know me: I am incredibly naive. At age 63, I am still \nincredibly naive.\n  I came to the Senate in 2013. One of the first things that happened \nwas the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the preclearance \nprovision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby v. Holder case. It \nhappened when I had been here about 6 months.\n  And the Supreme Court said: But Congress can fix this. Preclearance \nis fine. You just shouldn't use a geographical requirement that dates \nback to 1965. Just come up with a new standard for which jurisdictions \nshould have to preclear voting changes, and make it even-steven.\n  So we quickly did come up with something: You only have to get \npreclearance if you have had a history of voting rights problems in the \nlast 10 years. If you don't, no preclearance. We will treat every ZIP \nCode--north, west, east, south, midwest--exactly the same.\n  We came up with it, and we went to Republicans. We went to \nRepublicans knowing they were a great voting rights party--the 14th \nAmendment, the 15th Amendment, the 19th Amendment. The women's vote \nhappened in a Democratic administration but with Republican support. \nThe 26th Amendment--so 18-year-olds can vote--happened in the Nixon \nadministration.\n  But especially the Voting Rights Act, it wouldn't have happened \nwithout rock-solid Republican support. It was always reauthorized with \nRepublican support.\n  So at this moment when the act is gutted, we go to Republicans and \nsay: All you have to do is be consistent with the history of your party \nand help us fix the Voting Rights Act.\n  One. In the House, in the Senate, where is this 150-year history of \nsupporting voting rights? Only one--only the senior Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, would join in this effort.\n  I was so naive. I was so naive. But we are here today, and we have an \nopportunity. Why are we here? We know why we are here.\n  After preclearance was struck down, there began to be an escalating \navalanche of laws to make it harder for\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\npeople to vote. Then we had a President who did a frontal assault on \ndemocracy itself: demeaning the democracy; attacking election \nofficials; trying to dig up dirt on a Presidential opponent from a \nforeign country; refusing to concede; filing meritless lawsuits; \nbringing about threats against election officials; violence in the \nCapitol, against the Capitol, against these Members, against the \nstaffers, against Capitol Police, against our democracy; repeated \nefforts in States around the country to roll back; violent threats \nagainst election officials that persist even to today.\n  That is why we are here. We are standing exactly in the same spot as \nthat Senate stood in 1965: disenfranchisement efforts, coalesced by a \ngalvanizing action of violence--the beating of John Lewis on the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, AL. We have an avalanche of disenfranchisement \ngalvanized by an act of violence--the attack on this democracy, the \nphysical attack on January 6.\n  The time to act is now.\n  Let me respond quickly to some comments I have heard from colleagues \nthis morning, particularly Senator Cornyn. You have heard again and \nagain this theme that the bills we are attempting are a Federal \ntakeover of elections. They use that--federalizing elections, a Federal \ntakeover of elections.\n  So here comes the history quiz part of my speech. Both Senators \nDurbin and Klobuchar have referred to this and read it, and I am going \nto do it again: ``The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for \nSenators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the \nLegislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or \nalter such Regulations.''\n  How many times--how many times in the Constitution--can you read the \nphrase ``at any time''? The Constitution gives enormous powers to \nCongress in article I, enormous powers to the President in article II, \npowers to the judiciary in article III, powers to the States, powers to \nvoters. It is sort of assumed, when those powers are given, that they \ncan be exercised at any time.\n  But in one occasion--in one occasion only--the Framers decided: We \nhad really better spell out ``at any time.'' The only use of that \nphrase in the Constitution is to put an exclamation point, essentially, \nafter the notion that Congress must be able to act at any time to alter \nor make regulations with respect to the Federal vote.\n  Senator Cornyn said that 94 percent of people were happy after the \nNovember 2020 elections. Then why has the GOP decided to systematically \nweaken votes, take votes away, put obstacles in the path, kick out \nduly-sworn election officials, and put decisionmaking in other people's \nhands?\n  Senator Cornyn said that this was a partisan effort. Partisan? \nPartisan? One of the chapters of our bill is nonpartisan redistricting. \nThat is partisan?\n  Another part of our bill is complete transparency in all campaign \ncontributions. How is that partisan? Go poll any Republican, Democrat, \nIndependent populous about what they think of transparency in campaign \ncontributions. It is overwhelmingly popular. We have made some of these \nchanges in Virginia. Thank goodness that this bill would allow it.\n  We just had a Governor's race. Turnout went up by 20 percent, and a \nRepublican won. It wasn't my candidate. It was good for democracy.\n  This is not a partisan bill, even if the Republicans won't stand up \nfor it.\n  Finally, the Republican leader and Senator Cornyn started off with a \nlengthy ``Well, why won't you work on other stuff, like stuff about \nCOVID, stuff about the economy?'' My memory is pretty good. I think we \nwere here in March dealing with a significant bill that was about \nvaccinations and COVID and support for small businesses and a whole \nseries of things--hospitals, educational aid. How many Republicans \nvoted for that bill, the American Rescue Plan--you know, the one that \nwas COVID and the economy? None. Why don't we pay attention to some \nother stuff? Well, we have been, generally with little support.\n  I will close and say this: Congress may at any time, by law, make or \nalter such regulations--at any time. If not after the Supreme Court \ncuts the heart out of the Voting Rights Act, when? If not after an \navalanche of State legislation carving back voting rights, when? If not \nafter a violent attack, unprecedented in the history of this country, \non the Capitol of the United States to disenfranchise 80 million people \nand disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, when? If not after \nsubsequent Big Lies leading to action in State legislatures all over \nthis country, when?\n  We may act to protect Federal elections at any time. We are here for \nsuch a time, and the time to act is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, most of you know that I have a real job \nbesides being a U.S. Senator, and that real job includes farming the \nland, which includes spending--starting in the spring--12 to 16 hours a \nday on a tractor, where you get an opportunity, after you are going \naround and around and around, to think about anything you want to think \nabout.\n  Before I got in this job, I used to do math problems. Since I have \ngotten in this job, I think about this job when I am on a tractor, and \nI think about the U.S. Senate. I think about how over the last 15 years \nthis place has been incredibly dysfunctional. I have been here 15 \nyears; I can't speak to what it was like before that. But it has never \nworked since I have been here. The reason it has never worked is \nbecause--I had this idea in my head that, being the U.S. Senate, it \nwould be a place where we could have debate. In the greatest \ndeliberative body, you ought to be able to have debate. I think I saw \nSenator Durbin once almost get into a debate here, maybe twice. But it \njust simply doesn't happen, and it doesn't happen because we are not \nforced to do it because you take the easy way out. All you have to do \nis put a hold on a bill, and then you can walk out. In fact--I think it \nwas my second year here--there was a Senator who put a hold on a bill \nand then went back to his home State. He didn't even stick around.\n  I don't think that is what the forefathers had in mind. I think what \nthe forefathers had in mind is to stay here and have a discussion and \nhave a debate, and when people disagree, don't be disagreeable, but try \nto find common ground. That doesn't happen but rarely.\n  So you ask yourself what can be done about it. I have had the \nopportunity over the last 3 months to work pretty extensively with my \nfriend Senator King and Senator Kaine and Senator Manchin and talk \nabout ways we can move forward in a way that encourages people to come \nto the floor and debate, and I think there is a proposal to do exactly \nthat. This is a carve-out today, but the truth is that there is a \nproposal to protect minority rights and encourage people to come here \nand debate.\n  We ought to be doing that. It isn't nuking the body. It is not \ndestroying the U.S. Senate. It means we get a chance to stand here in \nfront of these cameras and challenge one another because we have to, \nbecause the rules force us to do that--not to go home to our home \nState, not to put a hold on a bill or a person and then not say a word \nwhy, not to be able to justify why you are doing that on the floor.\n  So I see this in a little different light than has been described by \nsome across the aisle, and I don't think this is blowing the Senate up \nat all. I think the Senate--if the forefathers looked at the Senate \ntoday, they would sit there and shake their heads and say: What has \ngone wrong?\n  I think what has gone wrong is, we have gotten lazy. It is the truth. \nThe last place, truthfully, I want to be is on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate trying to justify my position. I mean, that is a lot of work. It \ntakes time. It takes effort. We ought to be forcing people to do that. \nThat is part of this debate we are having here today.\n  We ought to realize that there is not a single Member of this body on \neither side of the aisle who wants to ``blow this place up.'' They \nmight describe it that way. But the truth is, everybody who serves in \nthis body knows that this body doesn't function as the U.S. Senate. It \ndoesn't function. We don't do what we need to do. We don't empower \ncommittees. We don't make sure our chairmen are doing what they need to \ndo. We don't debate on the U.S. Senate floor anymore, and we haven't \nfor 15\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nyears and probably a heck of a lot longer.\n  I happen to sit in the seat of Mike Mansfield. I don't think \nMansfield would look at this and say: This body works, and we ought not \nchange the rules because it works so well.\n  I think Mike Mansfield would say: Do you know what, guys? We did some \nchanges in 1976. You need to take a look back. Things have changed \nhere.\n\n  We have cameras now we didn't have in 1976. We have folks who come on \nthe floor and raise a lot of money on this floor by talking to those \ncameras instead of talking to one another about what is important here, \nabout the policies we need to take up.\n  So that is first thing. I don't think we should be afraid about \nadjusting the filibuster to make the U.S. Senate work. I think it is \nthe right thing to do--not blowing it up but making some adjustments to \nmake it work.\n  Now, let's talk about voting rights for just a moment. I believe \nthere are 19 States in the United States right now that, on a purely \npartisan basis, have changed the way votes--either access to the polls \nor the way votes are counted when they are done. I can't imagine \nanybody in here, when you look at that--and it has all been done on a \npartisan basis by Republican legislatures--when you would look at that, \nyou would say: Boy, this is moving our democracy forward.\n  You know what. When I got in the State senate in 1999, I worked with \na very conservative Republican on the State Administration Committee to \nmake voting easier. We worked together. We both had the same ideas in \nmind. We wanted to make voting easier in Montana, and we did it.\n  Now, it is a different world out there, and I really don't know why. \nLet me give you an example. When I ran in 2018, there were a record \nnumber of votes cast in Montana, and I won. A Democrat won. In 2020, \nthere was even a larger number of votes that were cast in 2020, and a \nRepublican won. This isn't about advantages for Democrats or advantages \nfor Republicans; this is about making it so everybody can have their \nvoice heard--something very basic to this country, by the way. We stand \nup here and talk on the floor about how people have sacrificed for the \nrights and the freedoms in this country, and one of those freedoms is \nthe freedom to vote. Lives have been sacrificed for it, but yet we want \nto limit certain groups of people from voting.\n  In Montana, for example, they have said that student IDs--a college \nstudent ID won't work as an ID to go to the polling place. Are you \nkidding me? I mean, first of all, what kind of message are you sending \nto the young people who are going to be running this show--and probably \na heck of a lot better than we are--in just a few years? You are \nsaying: Your voice doesn't count. You want to talk about \ndisenfranchising? This is crazy. It doesn't make any sense. It is \nreally hard for me to think how you justify--how do you justify saying \nthis is a good thing to have happen?\n  Voter registration. OK. Now, we are in this job. We all do this every \nday, think about it every day. So voter registration is probably no big \ndeal to us. But to working people who have to pay the bills, having to \ntake a half a day off of work to be able to go register when you can't \ndo it on election day--that is a big deal.\n  We all stand up here, and we always say: We are for working families; \nthey are the heartbeat of this country. And they are. But the truth is, \nwhat message are we sending to them when we say: No, you know what, no \nmore same-day voter registration--which, by the way, in Montana, it was \na vote of the people, and the legislature, a year ago right now, \nrepealed a vote of the people on same-day registration. So what message \nare we sending to those folks?\n  My good friend Raphael Warnock, Senator Warnock, talks about standing \nin line for 8 or 10 hours to vote. First of all, I don't know that I \nhave the will to stand in line, personally, for 8 or 10 hours to vote. \nI complained when they moved the polling place 3 miles from my house to \n15 miles from my house. But to stand in line for 8 to 10 hours--I mean, \nthat is a commitment to vote. Now we are going to make it tougher? We \nare going to make it so that when there are Good Samaritans out there \nhanding out water and maybe some soda crackers, we are going to say \n``No, that is illegal'' and punish them--breaking the law; punishment \nby--God knows what. A fine? Jail? I don't know.\n  What is it?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. A felony.\n  Mr. TESTER. It is a felony.\n  This is crazy, guys. We shouldn't be acting like the stuff that is \ngoing on in this country right now and has been going on mainly for the \nlast year--and my fellow Senators have talked about why it is the \ncase--we shouldn't act like it is no big deal. It is a huge deal. If we \ndisenfranchise voters in this country, our democracy is on a slide away \nfrom democracy.\n  As my friend Angus King has said many times on this floor, \ndemocracies are the exception, they are not the rule in history. They \nhave happened rarely, and they happen because people understand the \nsacrifices it takes.\n  We have sacrifices we need to make in this body, and part of it is, \nwe need to ensure that everybody has equal access to the polls so that \nthey can vote. It is fundamental to our democracy. That is why we are \nall sitting here. If it wasn't fundamental to our democracy, do you \nknow what? I would be doing something else. I would be in my office \nworking on papers or something like that--who knows. But the truth is, \nthis is fundamental to our democracy.\n  We can try to, you know, move the conversation and say: Why aren't we \ntalking about the economy? Senator Kaine said it very, very well. We \nhave dealt with economic issues. We need to continue to deal with \neconomic issues. We have dealt with supply chain issues with the \nbipartisan infrastructure bill. We need to continue to work with supply \nchain issues as we move forward, and we will. But I will tell you, if \nwe disenfranchise enough folks from the polls, we won't have a \ndemocracy to talk about anything because it is fundamental to our \ndemocracy.\n  I would just encourage everybody to take a look at the bill that is \npresented today, the two bills. Look at it. Don't talk about the one \nthat was presented in 2018 or 2019. We can all do that. That distracts \nfrom what is really going on. Look at the bill and ask yourself, ``Is \nthis really a Federal takeover of elections?'' It absolutely is not. It \nis about making it so people can go to the polls and make their voices \nheard and feel like they are making a difference in the country by \nvoting for the candidates whom they want or, in some cases, voting \nagainst the candidates they don't like.\n  And as far as the filibuster goes, times change, things change. And \none of the things that has changed in this body is we don't debate \nanymore. I am for anything that will get people to the floor so we can \ndebate the issues that are so important to the future of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hickenlooper). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to listen \nclosely to my friend Senator Kaine, who asked the important question \nabout voting rights, about when--when are we going to act? And that is \na question that is something that we, each of us, need to ask ourselves \nis ``when.'' But I think we also need to keep in mind the ``how'' we \nact because I think how we act is important--because I think we \nrecognize that when we act unilaterally as a party on issues that are \nof great weight and great political debate in this country, that \nsolutions to these difficult problems come best when we are able to be \nworking together.\n  I know that we are very fractured in this body, and it has made it \nhard, but hard does not mean it is impossible. It is only impossible if \nwe give up, and we say it can't be done.\n  To my friend from Montana--and I appreciate the commonsense words of \na man of the earth, a good farmer--amen to what you said about this \nbody and our dysfunctionality. We are not the same Senate that I came \nto close to 20 years ago. I beat you by about 5 years, 6 years. We are \nnot that same body. We are not operating in the manner with which I \nthink we really were designed to be--that tempering body, that \ndeliberative body. We are supposed to be the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, and we don't demonstrate that on any single day out \nthere.\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n  But I question whether or not changing the rules actually works to \nchange the attitude because that is what I think we have going on here. \nThe rules have been in place for a long while. It is just how we have \nchosen to utilize them to our advantage and to the disadvantage of the \nother side, and that is unfortunate.\n  I don't know how--it is much easier, I think, to change the rules \nthan it is to change attitude. It is much easier to try to do things \nalone than to try to build consensus. Just ask any one of the 10 of us \nwho worked tirelessly last year to advance a bipartisan infrastructure \nbill. There were so many points along the way where any one of us or \nany half of the group could have said: We are done. This is just too \nhard. We are never going to make progress.\n  But just because it is hard doesn't mean it is impossible.\n  The Senator from Montana urged us all to read the measure before us, \nthe Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, now pending before the Senate. \nIt has a few new things that have been added in, but much of it is what \nwe saw previously with the Freedom to Vote Act.\n  I voted against that motion for cloture when it came before us \nbecause I looked at that as being a bill that was overly prescriptive. \nIn my view, it really did work toward nationalizing elections. I come \nfrom a State where things are just a little bit different there. You \nhear me talk about it all the time. Part of it is dictated by the \ngeography. Part of it is dictated by an indigenous population where the \nlanguage that is on the ballot doesn't align with what they speak at \nhome and how we address matters like that.\n  What has happened with this measure in front of us is it has been \ncombined with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which I \nhave worked on in good faith with good colleagues whom I respect \nenormously, and I appreciate that we have been able to sit down. In \nfairness, much of the good work goes to our respective staffs who sat \ndown and said: All right, can we do a little bit over here? What do we \nneed to do over here? And we made some progress. We made enough \nprogress that I was certainly willing to vote to advance debate here on \nthe Senate floor on that measure.\n  I recognize that not everybody sees the value and the benefits of \npreclearance. I recognize what the courts did in Shelby, but I also \nheard, as Senator Kaine said, the courts saying: All right, legislative \nbranch, do something about it now.\n  So I have been willing to be part of that discussion, not only this \nCongress but in previous Congresses, where I have joined with Chairman \nLeahy to try to advance that conversation. We haven't been as \nsuccessful as I would have liked, but I certainly think we made good \nprogress with the John Lewis voting rights bill.\n  We had a substitute. As I look through this bill, it looks like much \nof that substitute has been incorporated, including the Native American \nVoting Rights Act, which I worked hard on in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee with Chairman Schatz to try to make that as robust as we \npossibly can. I have done all this because I do believe--I do believe--\nthat this Senate should pass a reauthorization of the Voting Rights \nAct, but I also believe that it must be a bipartisan effort.\n  It has been 16 years since we last addressed the Voting Rights Act. \nWe need to do more than just talk about it; we need to ensure that the \nballot is equal for all Americans and free from any discrimination. It \nis pretty simple for me in that regard. And wherever you have \nuncertainty, wherever you have ambiguity in the laws that govern our \nFederal elections, we need to clarify these. We need to clarify these \nso that there aren't these open questions or perhaps cynical \ninterpretations that would go with them.\n\n  So how do you do it? Because this is all hard stuff. We acknowledge \nthat. We acknowledge that. You really do have to do it coming together \nto try to hear the objections.\n  As I look at the measure that we have before us, I am not convinced \nthat we are there yet. I am not convinced that we are there yet with \nthe product that we have. I will absolutely agree that there are some \ngood--I think there are some important provisions in the measure that \nwe have in front of us. But what we are faced with today, or later \ntoday, is going to be a take-it-or-leave-it vote and then an effort to \nchange how we approach hard issues.\n  Before I get into my comments in that vein, I do want to look at and \nhighlight what I think are some of the positives that we have in place \nbecause--I think of a collaborative effort, but because we have shared \nobservations, we have shared views on what some of these solutions may \nbe, and I think that these can help us in anchoring a more broadly \nsupported bill.\n  The measure features transparency provisions that require public \nnotice of changes to State voting rules for Federal elections. I think \nwe would all say: Yes, this is important. This is common sense.\n  It has changes to electoral district boundaries for elections at all \nlevels, information about precincts and polling places for Federal \nelections. These are things that I think there is consensus here. We \nhave stronger protections, necessary protections for voters during \nregistration and voting as well as protections for election workers, \npolling places, election infrastructure.\n  The measure emphasizes the security of voting systems. I think we \nrecognize, again, this is imperative. It has to be a priority. If we \nare going to thwart any malign actors out there, maintain confidence in \nelection results, we have to have this.\n  Important to me, it extends the bilingual election requirements of \nthe Voting Rights Act for 5 years. It also includes the Native American \nVoting Rights Act, again, that we worked on in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to address, unfortunately, very longstanding obstacles to \nvoting for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  So there is good stuff, if you will, good measures that are contained \nwithin the bill in front of us.\n  But we also have some negatives. I think you have heard my colleagues \ndetail many of them--not only negatives within the text but in terms of \nthis partisan effort that we have in front of us.\n  We have a measure that is 753 pages long. We can move through that. \nWe are not going to say just because it is big doesn't mean that we \ncan't do it again. But it has come over to us through a shell vehicle. \nIt is now directly on the legislative calendar. You have, again, this \ncombination of two bills, plus a few add-ons.\n  But, unfortunately, neither of these--even with my support of the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Act--neither one of these had sufficient \nsupport to pass cloture. Since then, we haven't done anything. I \nshouldn't say ``anything'' because there were a few additional \nprovisions that were included. I don't want to dismiss that. But not \nmuch has been done to build support cooperatively in this body for the \ntwo combined measures, other than to build pressure to, not change the \nlegislation, not to modify it, not to gain compromise--but to change \nthe rules to take it up.\n  This is a big bill, but one of the things that we don't have \ncontained in it that many of us have been talking about now for a \nperiod of time is we don't address the Electoral Count Act, which I \nthink most of us would look at this and say that this is something that \nneeds to be revised.\n  We do not need a repeat of 2020 when, by all accounts, our last \nPresident, having lost the election, sought to change the results of \nthat election by demanding that his Vice President exploit vague \nstatutory language that was written decades ago. We need to address \nthis.\n  The bill before us has some gaps, but at the same time that it has \ngaps, it is also pretty prescriptive in many areas. Some of the \nprevious objections that I had made to the Freedom to Vote Act remain.\n  I share with my colleagues that I want us to protect voting rights. I \nthink we should all want to protect voting rights. But my concern is \nthat, as we look at this measure, is that it is going to make any kind \nof a change--any kind of a change that States would make to their \nelection laws for any reason--extremely difficult to do without being \ndirectly challenged in court.\n  And maybe--maybe--that is the goal here. But what it does do, in my \nview, is deprives States of the flexibility to design and implement \ntheir own laws as the Constitution provides.\n  Again, I look to my State for some of those very specific examples \nwhere, if I\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\nhave a small remote village with perhaps 100 voters and I have a \nprescription in Federal law that says a polling place must be open and \navailable for a period of a week to 10 days with 2 weekends--if you are \nout in a village and you are living a sustenance lifestyle, Saturday or \nSunday don't mean anything to you. It is winter. When are the animals \nmoving? When are the fish moving?\n  Let's not put limits on our States so that they can't enhance \nopportunities for all voters.\n  So federalization is not the right answer here, and, again, whether \nwe are talking voting rights or other issues, typically in my State a \none-size-fits-all approach is not the right effort. So we have got to \nfind an appropriate balance that doesn't result in a takeover of \nStates' ability to run their own elections, and how we are able to \nachieve that balance is important.\n  So as I talk about my views on the legislation that we have before \nus, I am very, very well aware that the results of this effort to push \nvoting rights was, unfortunately, determined before we began this \ndebate. We are going to come to a vote on a motion to invoke cloture. \nWe know what is going to happen. It is going to fail due to a lack of \nsufficient support. And then we are going to face some kind of a vote \nto change the Senate's rules and weaken the legislative filibuster, \nwhich we also understand will fail. And I guess the point here is to \nget folks on record, and that will happen.\n  But what have we accomplished? What have we accomplished for the \npeople that we serve? Instead of allowing us as a body to say, ``OK, \nwhat are we going to do to address this,'' we have brought cross-party \nrelationships to yet another low--perhaps, an unprecedented low.\n  I was part of a very troubling conversation last evening, and it was \nshared that, you know, depending on which side you are on in this body \ntoday on this issue, you are either a racist or a hypocrite. Really? \nReally? Is that where we are? I find that so, so hard and so troubling, \nbecause when it becomes that deep and that divided where we cannot have \nthe debate that my friend from Montana says we need--and I agree we \nneed--but if we are so, so divided, this is not right. This is not good \nfor the health of the body.\n  But what has happened here is we have devolved into a debate over \nvoting rights versus voting rules, and you have got part of the country \nthat thinks this bill is about protecting the right to vote. Another \npart believes that this bill will do nothing but undermine it. And so \nwe are both sitting in a situation, I think, where both sides are now \nset to cast doubt on elections if they don't win. And that takes us to \na very troubling place, because when people doubt whether their vote \nmatters, when they doubt whether that individual who is sitting in the \nWhite House was freely and fairly elected, they will doubt all \ndecisions. They will doubt what we do here, and they will doubt their \nown democracy. And that is troubling for our Nation.\n  So I refuse to believe that this is the best that we can do right \nnow. As I said, this is hard, but hard is not impossible. I think that \nwe can, if we are operating in good faith, as there are so many in this \nbody who do that on a daily basis--it doesn't get noted because, quite \nhonestly, it is far more interesting to write about the fur that flies \naround here, rather than us actually making things happen together.\n  But the effort to change our rules, to pass legislation on a party-\nline basis is not going to help us here. It is not going to help us \nhere. I think we need to do everything that we possibly can to avoid \nfurther polarizing voting rights and election reforms.\n  It may be too late. I don't know. It may be just too late, but I \nthink we have to try. I think that we have to try. And I think that \nthere is an effort to try to do just that. There is a good handful of \npeople in this body on both sides of the aisle who have been talking \nthis, through kind of following the model of what we did with the \nbipartisan infrastructure group.\n  You know, when we first started that effort, nobody believed that we \nwould be successful with that. Probably, most listening to the debate \nthat is going on now and will go on later all throughout the afternoon \ndon't believe that we can do anything. But let's prove them wrong. \nLet's prove them wrong. Let's sit down with those who have made that \ncommitment--we have heard it here on the floor--made that commitment to \nwork through some of these issues, some of these areas of common ground \nthat I think we can build a base from, and work to build a foundation \nthat will be enduring for this country when it comes to election reform \nand voting rights, because I fear greatly that if we are to advance \nmeasures that are solely, strictly party line--and that is what \neliminating the legislative filibuster will allow us to do--we will \ntake the easy way out.\n  Senator Tester suggested that maybe we are getting a little \nlegislatively lazy around here. We will get even lazier, because we \ndon't have to do the hard work of trying to find consensus. Elections \nand voting rights are so important. We understand that. Let's commit to \nresolving the issues that divide us, that will not only help bring this \nCongress closer together, but that just possibly, just hopefully--and \nmaybe I, too, am naive, Senator Kaine--but that just possibly can help \nheal this country, because that is what we need right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are here today to talk about our \ndemocracy, and here is what I know about how a democracy actually \nworks. I come out here to the Senate floor every day, just like every \nMember of this Chamber, and I fight for what I believe in. And I use my \nvoice to do that, and I use my vote to do that.\n  The same is true for every citizen of this country. They use their \nvote to say what they want the future of our democracy to look like. \nBut, right now, States across the country are taking away that right. \nThey are taking away their voice.\n  We have to make sure that every vote is never taken away, that no \nvoice is taken away, or we are going to lose the democracy in the \nfuture.\n  And here is what is happening right now. Republican legislatures are \nmaking it hard to vote for certain groups of people--primarily Black \nAmericans, Native Americans, young people, and people with \ndisabilities, just because they might vote for a Democrat.\n  This is a national coordinated effort to keep Republicans in power at \nevery level of government by keeping Americans away from the ballot \nbox, by keeping Americans from being able to use their voice and their \nvote. Specifically, Republican legislatures are passing legislation to \nmake it harder for people to vote by mail; drastically eliminating the \navailability of secure drop boxes so people can safely drop off their \nballot; and reducing early voting hours or days.\n  And it is all done to demoralize and discourage people--working \npeople--from making their voices heard and to make the democratic \nprocess so much more cumbersome. That is a mom who is juggling \nchildcare and schooling during the pandemic, who is going to look for \noptions to get that ballot in, to get her voice in, to get her vote in, \nand she won't able to find a way to do that with all of her \nresponsibilities.\n  Maybe there is not a drop box near her, or maybe early voting hours \nhave been cut short, or maybe the new rules about voting by mail are \njust too complicated.\n  Because of those barriers that are being erected in Republican \nlegislatures, that mom will not get to advocate for her kids or her \ncommunity with her vote. And too many Republicans want it to work \nexactly like that.\n  And those far-right politicians also want to pick their own voters--\nliterally drawing lines between communities to reinforce partisan \ndivides.\n  Congressional Democrats are working to do the opposite. Instead of \nletting politicians draw maps to rig the outcomes in favor of one party \nor another, we just want to end partisan gerrymandering.\n  Because--let's be clear--people should pick their representatives in \nthe United States of America, not the other way around. And what we are \nseeing happening across the country is undemocratic, and in no \nuncertain terms, it is a threat to this democracy.\n  And if you don't believe me, look at what the former President said \njust\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\nthis past weekend. Donald Trump, the leader of the Republican Party, \ncontinues as we know to spread the lie that the 2020 election was \nstolen from him. He is working hard, out in the open, to convince every \nAmerican that he can that our free, fair election in 2020 was \nillegitimate.\n  But even more concerning is the former President's explicit stated \ndetermination to rig the outcome of future elections. In a recent \nrecorded message Donald Trump said:\n\n       We have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to \n     counting the vote. . . . Sometimes the vote counter is more \n     important than the candidate.\n\n  More important than the candidate? And what Donald Trump means in \nthis case was clear. He wants his loyalists to oversee our elections to \nmake sure the outcome is always in his favor. I mean, just sit with \nthat. We are not talking about hypotheticals here. The leader of the \nRepublican Party wants to toss democracy out the window and change the \noutcome of any election results he doesn't like.\n  History is sitting on our shoulders right now. The American people \nare looking to us for a way to move forward and protect the right to \nvote, and this is it. And all that is standing in our way is Senate \nprocedure--Senate procedure that a majority of us voted last month to \nchange.\n  Now, I understand the reluctance around reforming the filibuster. I \ndo. I understand we want this institution to work, to be bipartisan \nwhen it comes to tackling big challenges. But here is the deal: I don't \nthink that carving out a path to pass voting rights on a simple \nmajority precludes that.\n  In fact, I think it is past time that we reform the filibuster to \nmake sure the world's greatest deliberative body actually deliberates \nthe issues and challenges that are facing the American people.\n  But today's Senate procedure keeps us from that kind of deliberation. \nSenate rules not unlike the partisan gerrymandering we are seeing in \nStates across the country push Democrats and Republicans further into \ntheir corners, rather than toward collaboration, making it unbelievably \neasy to block legislative action and nearly impossible to start it.\n  And that means Americans do not get to see where elected officials \nstand on issues as consequential as protecting the right to vote. To \neven have the debate we are having right now, we had to dig through \nSenate rules and quite literally repurpose a bill that allows NASA to \nlease its property. Otherwise, we wouldn't even be standing here on the \nfloor today to have this discussion about voting rights. That does not \nmake sense.\n  It should not be so difficult to make it so the public can see where \neach of us stands. And let's remember that these voter suppression laws \nare all being passed mainly on a partisan basis with simple majorities.\n  Now, some have suggested that if we believe these laws are \nunconstitutional we should fight them in the courts, take our arguments \nall the way to the Supreme Court. But remember, there are three Supreme \nCourt Justices all appointed by a simple majority of this Senate \nwithout the filibuster.\n  So let's recap. Republicans want to appoint judges without a \nfilibuster standing in their way. They want Republican State lawmakers \nto be able to pass voter suppression laws without a filibuster. But \nDemocrats can't protect the basic right to vote on a simple majority.\n  That is what we are talking about here today: making election day a \nFederal holiday, making sure everyone can vote by mail, ending \ngerrymandering so voters can pick their politicians and not the other \nway around. These are simple, straightforward reforms, with tremendous \nsignificance for our country's future as a democracy.\n  And the path to getting them done is simple and straight forward too. \nWhat each of us has to do is decide that our democracy comes before \nSenate procedure and then cast our votes.\n  I have made my decision, and here is what I believe: We cannot let \nthe filibuster stop us from protecting every American's right to vote. \nIf it is the filibuster or democracy, I will choose democracy. If it is \nthe Senate rules or a Senate that works for the American people, I will \nchoose a Senate that works.\n  And I urge my colleagues with all of my heart, for the sake of this \ndemocracy, to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I am here today to address Democrat \nleadership's effort to demolish the Senate rules and structure, and \nthereby destroy the world's greatest deliberative body. Their ploy \nwould silence millions of Americans, and it would substantially harm \nour Nation.\n  Abolishing the filibuster would end the Senate's unique role in \nAmerican Government, which has kept us on the steady course of becoming \na more perfect union for the past 230 years. This unique role is to \nensure that Federal legislation, covering all 50 States, requires \ncareful debate and broad support, often reflecting compromise, so that \nAmerican policy is durable and lasting.\n  That way, as the senior Senator from Arizona put it in her courageous \nand patriotic remarks last week, we avoid ``wild reversals in Federal \npolicy'' every few years on the basis of bare majorities, which would \nmake our government far less effective and our economy far less stable.\n  Democrats know how integral the filibuster is to American Government. \nDemocrats have said it themselves. Eliminating the filibuster would \n``be the end of the Senate.'' That is a direct quote from the senior \nSenator from Illinois in 2018.\n  The Democratic leader, before assuming his current position, said \nthat eliminating the filibuster would ``be a doomsday for democracy.''\n  And President Biden, when he was Senator Biden, said that to \neliminate the filibuster would be ``the arrogance of power.'' \nApparently, he is now suffering from such arrogance.\n  Until they took control of the Senate last year, most Democrats \npassionately advocated for preserving this critical Senate rule. That \nis because it enables our representative government to function and \nreflect the will of the people.\n  Indeed, in 2017, when there was a Republican in the Oval Office and a \nRepublican majority in the Senate, 32 Democrats, including then-Senator \nKamala Harris, signed a letter supporting the filibuster.\n  During the Trump administration, Democrats routinely used the \nfilibuster to block Republican legislation, including bills on police \nreform, border security, and late-term abortions; important bills that \nimpacted life, sovereignty, and community safety--certainly, bills that \nRepublicans wanted to enact.\n  Yet, when met with the filibuster, Republicans didn't change the \nrules on a completely partisan basis. Republicans didn't tear down this \ninstitution in order to score short-term partisan political points, and \nRepublicans certainly didn't use cheap demagoguery to create a fake \nhysteria to justify doing so.\n  Yet now that Democrats are in the majority, nearly every one of those \n32 Democrats has completely reversed himself or herself, with a few \nnotable exceptions. Why? Because this is about one thing: Power. Doing \nthe exact same thing is a doomsday for democracy when it is a bill \nthey oppose, but it is essential to save democracy when it is a bill \nthey support. It is about power.\n\n  There doesn't seem to be a power grab that is too extreme for the \nmodern left, whether it is abolishing the filibuster, packing the \nSupreme Court, or making the District of Columbia a State. There is no \ninstitution that they aren't willing to destroy.\n  This is shameful because Democrat leaders' past statements show that \nthey know that destroying the Senate would be disastrous for our \nNation.\n  Let's call this what it is. It is worse than a solution in search of \na problem. It is a power grab in search of a crisis. In this case, they \nhad to manufacture a crisis to justify the power grab.\n  They have been trying to pass this bill for years. Democrat \noperatives first introduced a version of this bill on January 24, 2017, \n4 days after President Trump was elected to office. It was part of \ntheir scorched-earth policy to challenge the 2016 election results, \nclinging to the false claims of Russian collusion. Since then, they \nhave continued to maniacally, and on a wholly partisan basis, push this \nelectioneering fantasy.\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n  Even though this bill is about keeping power, they use whatever \njustification is most convenient at the moment. In 2017, it was \nPresident Trump and Russia. In 2020, it was the pandemic. And now, it \nis the preposterous claim that returning to prepandemic voting \npractices is the end of democracy.\n  This election takeover would impose taxpayer-funded campaigns. It \nprohibits overwhelmingly popular, commonsense State voter ID laws. What \ndoes nullifying voter ID laws and handing out taxpayer-funded campaign \ndollars have to do with voting rights?\n  Last night, the senior Senator from Virginia pointed out that \nRepublicans have always led the way on voting rights. So why not now? \nBecause this bill isn't about protecting voting rights. It is about \nprotecting politicians. This isn't the 14th Amendment. It is Washington \nDemocrats' 14th attempt to take over elections in all 50 States for the \nthird different reason in the last several years.\n  Americans want laws that make it easy to vote and hard to cheat. Such \nlaws currently exist throughout the country. That is why we had \nrecordbreaking voter participation in 2020, including in my home State \nof Tennessee.\n  So ask yourself: With more Americans voting in the last election than \never before, why is this Democrats' top priority? Why are they willing \nto destroy the Senate to do it? What is the real reason they are \nfocusing on this made-up crisis, while ignoring actual crises of \ninflation, falling real wages, soaring energy prices, supply chain \ncrises, a collapsed southern border, the collapse of Afghanistan, and \nincreased authoritarian aggression around the world--real problems that \nactually affect the American people?\n  Democrat leaders have tuned out those concerns. They are taking no \naction to address them. Think about it. Our country has the highest \ninflation rate in 40 years, and the Senate Banking Committee, which has \njurisdiction over our Nation's monetary policy, has not held a single \nhearing examining this topic since it began in 2021.\n  To avoid those issues, they have created a fake crisis to take over \nelections--a desperate attempt at self-preservation because Americans \nare rejecting their agenda. That is the real reason Democrats are \npushing this. It is about protecting the power of politicians here in \nWashington.\n  Elections should be determined by the voters, not by the politicians.\n  Last week, President Biden traveled to Georgia to demonize all \nAmericans who don't submit to this hyperpartisan political agenda. He \nranted that Americans who support the constitutional system of free, \nfair, and locally run elections are somehow bigots.\n  In support of this scheme, the Democrat leader offers the talking \npoint that State legislatures don't have filibuster rules so why should \nthe U.S. Senate?\n  The answer to this is obvious: because Federal legislation governs \nall 50 States, as opposed to State legislation that just affects one \nState. It requires broader support, more than a bare majority in a 50-\n50 Senate.\n  This is the greatest Nation on Earth, and the Senate is its compass. \nThis isn't the Democrat leaders' political play thing.\n  Ensuring broad support for Federal laws, which ensures American \nstability, is the very purpose of the U.S. Senate. Sadly, this election \npower grab is just the start. With the filibuster gone, Democrats would \nbe free to enact mass amnesty, pack the Supreme Court, pack the Senate, \npunish law enforcement officers, and much, much more.\n  It was my hope, coming into this new year, that the Senate would \nrefocus on what we were elected to do: Listen to the American people \nand address their concerns. Yet the recent rhetoric of Democrat \nleadership has dispelled any such optimism.\n  The American people deserve a government that acknowledges their \nconcerns and works tirelessly and constructively to address them. The \nserious problems we face as a nation demand it.\n  Americans want us to do our jobs. Abolishing the Senate's rules that \nguarantee debate and compromise would be ``the end of the Senate,'' as \nthe senior Senator from Illinois put it. It would do irreparable harm \nto the fabric of our government and to the cohesion of our Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues find the strength and the courage to maintain \ntheir previous, longstanding support for preserving the Senate's role. \nI hope they reject this cynical move to steamroll half of its Members \nand the voters they represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, colleagues, with Senator Kaine as my \nwitness, I, like many of you, had an opportunity to stand here \nyesterday to begin to speak on the issues before us--the need for this \nurgent and critical voting rights legislation and our opportunity to \nact this week in the spirit of the holiday we celebrated on Monday, \nMartin Luther King Day.\n  Before I get into my substantive remarks, I just feel compelled to \nrespond to a couple of items that Senator Hagerty just mentioned. And \nif he is willing to stay and listen, that would be appreciated, but \nthat is his choice.\n  You know, a couple of our Republican colleagues have made mention to: \nWell, we shouldn't focus on voting rights; there are other pressing \nissues at hand, things like the economy.\n  Well, last I checked, because of our actions last year, especially \nthe investments in the American Rescue Plan, wages are up and \nunemployment is at record lows.\n  Democrats are taking action. We have been called out on what are we \ndoing to address supply chain issues. We have acted. The infrastructure \nand jobs act has been signed by the President, and I can attest that in \nthe Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the percentage of containers \nwaiting to be picked up is drastically down. Democrats are taking \naction.\n  COVID. Yeah, we are still dealing with this once-in-a-century global \nhealth pandemic. But imagine how much better a position we would be in, \nhow many lives we would have saved, if the Trump administration took \nresponsible action much earlier in this pandemic, and imagine how fewer \ncases and deaths we would have to count if more people would get \nvaccinated.\n  Senator Hagerty, like many Republicans, says: Well, when it comes to \nvoting and elections, we should be focusing on making it easier to vote \nand harder to cheat. Who wouldn't agree with that?\n  But here is the truth. Here is reality. We know what it takes to make \nit easier to vote. That is what we are calling for in the Freedom to \nVote Act, and I will go through some of the specifics here in a minute. \nBut ``the harder to cheat'' misses the point. The evidence is there. \nThe data is out there. Massive voter fraud doesn't exist. Voter fraud \nis exceedingly rare in America. So we got the ``harder to cheat'' part \ndown, if only Republican Senators and legislatures and Governors, for \nthat matter, would embrace the proven reforms that make it easier for \neligible Americans to cast their ballot in our democracy.\n  But the most egregious, I just have to say, when Senator Hagerty \nsuggests that changes to elections law should only be done after \ncareful debate and broad support, I invite him to say the same things \nto Governors and legislators in Georgia, in Texas, in Arizona, and \nelsewhere, and I will go through some examples in the course of my \npresentation.\n  But, colleagues, as I have had an opportunity to share with many of \nyou, you know that, before I joined the Senate last year, I served for \n6 years as California's chief elections officer. I served as California \nsecretary of state, the largest State in the Nation with the largest \nand most diverse electorate in the Nation. And in that role, I had a \nchance to oversee a side of election administration that most Americans \nand most U.S. Senators never really experience. Former State \nsecretaries of state serving in this body: Senator Blunt, Senator \nBrown, Senator Manchin, and myself, the most recent. And my experience, \nby the way, included overseeing the administration of the November 2020 \nPresidential election in the most populous State in the Nation.\n\n  So I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly how the Freedom to \nVote Act will help all voters and respond to some more of the claims I \nhave heard about this bill from my Republican colleagues.\n  See, the purpose of the Freedom to Vote Act is to give every eligible\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\nAmerican more choices about how and when they cast their ballot. No \nmatter where you live, no matter which State, no matter which ZIP Code, \nno matter your political party preference, you deserve multiple, safe, \nsecure, accessible options for registering to vote and for casting your \nballot.\n  Isn't that what we were all supposed to have learned in high school \ngovernment class; that our democracy works best when as many people \nparticipate--the will of the people, not the will of the few, not the \nwill of the privileged few, the will of the people.\n  But today voters in different States take different paths to the \nballot box, some more difficult than others, needlessly. And sometimes \nwhat some of you may view as a small obstacle can add up to a big \ndeterrent to participation, depending on where you live, depending on \nwhere you work, depending on your disability, and more. That is why the \nFreedom to Vote Act is so critical. It will help all Americans by \nguaranteeing the same baseline of access to the ballot to all eligible \nAmericans.\n  And, no, this is by no means a Federal takeover of elections. I \nappreciate that several of my colleagues have gone through the history \nof Congress acting to protect the right to vote and to improve \nelections. So let me really bottom line it and make this point. With \nthe passage of the Freedom to Vote Act, it is not Congress that will be \ndistributing ballots or the Federal Government that will be collecting \nballots and counting ballots. Election administration will still be \nlocal. What we are doing is setting a baseline for access to the ballot \nfor all eligible Americans, and, yes, it is appropriate for us to do \nso, as Senator Klobuchar, Senator Peters and others have referenced the \nConstitution, referenced prior congressional action, and I will point \nit out too.\n  It has already been pointed out that in the Constitution, the \nConstitution of the United States, ``The Times, Places and Manner of \nholding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed \nin each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any \ntime by Law make or alter such Regulations.''\n  That is what we are seeking to do.\n  But I really want to up the ante, folks, and I need you to listen to \nme because there are two important words. Senator Peters gave you the \nlist, right? The Voting Rights Act, the Help America Vote Act, the \nNational Voter Registration Act, 1993, passed on a bipartisan basis. In \nit you will read that ``it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to promote the exercise of [the fundamental right to \nvote].''\n  I call your attention to two words, ``the duty'' of government--not \nthe option, not the if you wanna, not the may.\n  The duty of government, to what? To promote the exercise of the \nfundamental right to vote--not just to sit back and make sure that \nelections are run fair and square, not just to say: Hey, it is up to \nyou voters if you want to register to vote. Government has a duty to \npromote the exercise of the fundamental right to vote.\n  So now to the specifics of the Freedom to Vote Act and how it tries \nto live up to that duty of government to promote. Well, as we all know, \nyou can't vote unless you are registered to vote, and different States \nhave different options for how to register to vote. Once upon a time, \nyou had to present yourself in person at a county courthouse. Imagine \nthe innovation that it took, the getting out of the comfort zone, once \nupon a time, for folks around the country that we had the audacity to \nsuggest: Wait a minute. You can register to vote by mail or sign a \nvoter registration card under penalty of perjury that your information \nis true and correct, attesting to your eligibility.\n\n  Now, some States have only the option of voting through that card or \nin person. Other States have innovated and accepted things like online \nvoter registration--imagine that--or automatic registration, same-day \nregistration.\n  Again, I want to talk to you in a minute about that. But let me give \nthe big picture of why it is important. The numbers are out there. The \ndata is out there. Who is it who tends to be eligible to vote in \nAmerica but not registered to vote? Disproportionately, communities of \ncolor, disproportionately low-income communities, disproportionately \nyoung people--eligible voters--but voters of color, potential voters of \ncolor, young people, and low-income are disproportionately not \nregistered.\n  So we can either act--as the NVRA says, we have a duty to promote--to \nincrease those registration numbers or not. To live up to the duty, we \nneed to, and if we don't or perhaps even if we make it harder to vote \nor stay registered to vote, who are you disproportionately affecting?\n  So Republicans can deny their intent. We know the true effect of \nmaking it harder to register to vote or to stay registered to vote.\n  So, again, different States have different options. In Alaska, you \ncan register in person, by mail, online, automatic voter registration. \nIn California--yes, I am proud--in person, by mail, automatic \nregistration, online, election day same-day registration. In Texas, \nMississippi, only in person or by mail.\n  Different States, different rules.\n  Everybody deserves the same opportunity. So why the value of online \nvoter registration? Well, first of all, it is convenient, right? There \nis a whole lot that people have become accustomed to doing online. \nSecond, for the ``good government'' types and the folks who want to \nmake prudent use of precious taxpayer dollars, it lowers administrative \ncosts. When you allow voters to register online, it is seamless; it is \nquick; and it is easy.\n  I have been to county election offices where you have clerical staff \nsitting there with a pile, a stack of voter registration cards that \nthey have to read and input by hand--not very efficient. Online voter \nregistration increases efficiency and, by the way, accuracy. I don't \nhave the best penmanship. Can you imagine the clerical staff and county \noffices trying to make out, well, how do you spell this name that can \nbe spelled three or four or five different ways. Online registration \nreduces those types of errors and cleans up the voting rolls and is \nvery cost-efficient to implement and has been proven, in State after \nState, to be safe, secure, and effective.\n  But should online registration be the only option? No. And we \nshouldn't take away the in-person or paper registration. Some States \nhave innovated automatic voter registration, where we take advantage of \nthe opportunity when citizens are interfacing with their government--\nparticularly the DMV. Ninety percent of eligible voters in America will \neither have a driver's license or a State ID. And what are we asked to \nprovide when we conduct that transaction? We are asked to provide our \nname, our address, our date of birth, a signature attesting to the \naccuracy of our information--all the same information that is asked for \nwhen we are registering to vote. So it is just common sense to utilize \nthat same transaction for eligible citizens to seamlessly be registered \nto vote at the same time.\n\n  Going back to the National Voter Registration Act, which requires \nvoter registration opportunity for people when they go to their \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, that will serve as an opt-in model. \nThanks to technology today, we can implement this opt-out model. You \nstill have the option as a voter to not be registered to vote, if you \nchoose not to, but the default is, if you are eligible, you are added \nto the voter rolls. And similar to online registration, it has been \nproven safe; it has been proven secure; it has been proven effective. \nFrom an elections perspective, it is wonderful. It doesn't just capture \npreviously eligible but unregistered voters now adding them to the \nvoter rolls. If you are already registered to vote, when you renew your \nlicense or your voter ID--guess what--you are asked: Is this your \ncurrent address?\n  Now, when most people move, they are quick to do the change of \naddress through the post office because they don't want to miss out on \ntheir mail. You are updating your driver's license or your ID because \nit has to reflect your current address. But a lot of people don't think \nof, ``Oh, let me call the county and update my voter registration.'' \nThis is a seamless and effective way of doing that.\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\n  In California, our experience, similar to other States, for every new \nregistered voter that was enrolled through automatic registration, you \nhad at least two voters who updated or confirmed the accuracy of their \nregistration. So, collectively, it leads to the most accurate voter \nrolls we have had in a long, long time.\n  Isn't that worth doing? Isn't that in the interest of election \nintegrity?\n  And it is not a partisan idea. States, not just California, States \nlike Alaska, represented by Republicans, have automatic voter \nregistration. The State of Maine, which has sent to this body a \nRepublican and an Independent, has automatic voter registration.\n  Now, here is a true lover of democracy's perspective on automatic \nregistration. Reverend Warnock, I hope you can appreciate this.\n  Colleagues, think about it. If you are eligible to vote in America \ntoday but not registered, you do not receive the State's voter \ninformation guide if your State provides one because you are not on the \nlist. If you are eligible to vote in America today but not registered, \nyour county doesn't send you your sample ballot to know when election \nday is, where to go, and what we are voting on. If you are eligible to \nvote in America today but not registered, chances are candidates and \ncampaigns aren't knocking on your door or calling you during dinner or \nflooding your mailbox trying to engage you in the democratic process. \nMaybe the smart campaigns and candidates are trying to reach out to \nmore voters, but, by and large, that doesn't happen. So the sheer \naddition of adding eligible Americans to the voter rolls creates that \nactivity.\n  Imagine that--civic engagement. Imagine that--participation in our \ndemocracy. But why stop there?\n  Same-day registration option. What if you missed a prior artificial \ndeadline of registering to vote or updating your registration and come \nelection day you are still 18 years or older and a citizen of the \nUnited States? You deserve the opportunity to have your voice heard in \nthat election and election administrators know how to do this. You can \nregister to vote, and whether your registration is automatically \nprocessed for jurisdictions that have the technology and the history to \ndo so or your registration is held and your ballot is held, you can \nstill cast your ballot, have the county process your registration, and \nyour voice is heard in that election. That is what democracy is \nsupposed to be about.\n  And, again, not partisan. Twenty States, including Republican-leaning \nStates, have already implemented same-day registration, including \nWyoming, Idaho, and Utah. California implemented--we technically call \nit conditional voter registration, but starting in 2017.\n  In 2020--just to give you a flavor for what it means. In 2020, nearly \n270,000 California voters were same-day registered, 270,000. That is \nlike half of a House district. Of all in-person California voters in \n2020, nearly 10 percent were same-day registered.\n  The others--you know, why such a big number? Because so many people \nvoted by mail, voted early, et cetera. And it is not partisan. Of the \nsame-day registrants, when the registrations were processed, 36.2 \npercent were not affiliated with any political party. This is 32 \npercent Democrats and 25 percent Republicans. So it is not partisan. It \nis good for everybody.\n\n  As we know, registration is only half the battle. Just because \nsomebody may be registered doesn't guarantee that they are going to \ncast their ballot.\n  In going back to the NVRA, folks, the government has a duty to \npromote the exercise of our fundamental right to vote. So we have a \nduty to implement this, and these are proven reforms on the \nregistration side.\n  What about on the casting your ballot side?\n  Again, once upon a time, you had to show up in person on election \nday, only between this hour and that hour, at one designated location. \nIn this modern economy, with so many different types of work schedules, \nthat is not exactly easy. I live in Los Angeles, where we have this \nthing that we call traffic. So, if you have a job that is no longer 9 \nto 5--imagine--and you have to drop the kids off at school before you \nleave for work and have a full day and are dealing with traffic in \ngetting back and have to get the kids from school and have to get \ndinner on the table, now I have got to go to one designated location \nand be in line by a certain hour to vote. There has got to be a better \nway, and there is.\n  Depending on the State where you live, you have options that include \nvoting on election day in person; voting in person but early, prior to \nelection day; or voting by mail--again, all proven, secure, effective \nways to cast your ballot. But we have a mishmash across the country. \nCalifornia and Alaska, by the way, have election day, vote-by-mail, and \nearly voting. In Texas, it is on election day only or early voting, but \nthere is very limited vote-by-mail. In Mississippi, sorry--election day \nonly. In Connecticut, sorry--election day only. Yes, even Democratic \nStates have room for improvement in making the process easier.\n  We shouldn't be hampered because of the demands on our time--family \nobligations, work obligations. That is why States like Utah were early \nproponents of voting by mail. It is why States like Arizona were early \nproponents of early voting. So we should strive to provide all voters \nin America the same baseline of access to the ballot. Duty to promote--\nbefore the Freedom to Vote Act, that is exactly what we were trying to \ndo.\n  At this point, let me just reply to something our colleague Senator \nCornyn referenced. I wish I could borrow, right now, the board that he \nhad right next to him. Did you guys see that big ``94 percent'' that he \nhad on the board? He was citing a Pew Research Center report that said \n94 percent of voters in the November 2020 election found it easy to \nvote. That is great, and I will tell you why.\n  It is because, in 2020, because of the threat of the pandemic, even \nStates that were resistant prior to affording voters more early voting \noptions knew that it was smart to do so in order to reduce crowds and \nlong lines on election day. That is why States that were even reluctant \nprior to 2020 to expand their vote-by-mail opportunities knew that it \nwas smart to do so so that people could vote safely and securely from \nhome, and it worked. It was the most secure election in our history, \nwith record turnout.\n  So, if that is the case, why go backward? Why go backward? Because \nthat is what they are doing in the States that have introduced and \npassed--what?--33, 34--and counting--laws that are making it harder to \nregister to vote, harder to cast their ballots, which is contrary to \nthe NVRA--duty to promote.\n  So what are the options for early voting?\n  As we mentioned, we want to be specific. See, most States already \nhave some sort of in-person early voting opportunity, but it is \ninconsistent. Some offer weekends; some don't. Some offer evening \nopportunities to vote; some don't--or before work hours and after work \nhours. Every voter, regardless of the demands on your time, deserves \nequal opportunities to vote prior to election day, in person, if that \nis your choice.\n  Mail voting. Again, a lot of States have some sort of mail voting, \nbut we are specific to no-excuse voting by mail. Voting by mail is \nsecure. It has been proven to be secure. So why have only a limited \nsubset of the electorate been able to benefit from that? We saw it work \nbeautifully in November 2020. Imagine how much better it could work \nonce we are past the pandemic. Mail voting was pioneered, actually, in \na lot of Western States, not blue or red. North Dakota, South Dakota, \nWyoming, Idaho, and Nebraska came along with Utah in doing all-mail \nelections in addition to Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and California.\n  Let me tell you the other beauty of vote-by-mail, especially when we \ncover postage. I don't have a roll of stamps in my kitchen drawer \nanymore, as very little is done that way, but when you are voting by \nmail, we can cover that postage delivery. You get your ballot in the \nmail; you give it back to your letter carrier; and it gets back to the \ncounty and is counted.\n  Some people may wonder, though--and we have had this battle across \nthe country and in these Chambers over the course of the last year--\nabout what is happening at the Postal Service these days. Is mail \nquick? Is it slow? What about the pandemic? What about changes in \nprocesses and procedures under the postmaster?\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  Well, in California--Colorado has it, as well, and other \njurisdictions across the country--we have a tool that allows voters to \ntrack their ballots through the mail. This is going to blow your mind. \nImagine signing up to receive either phone calls, emails, or text \nmessages on the status of your ballot through the mail service. Wow.\n  Mr. Padilla, the county just mailed you your ballot. Be on the \nlookout, right? It is going to come in the next few days.\n  When I return it, I receive confirmation that the Postal Service has \ntaken possession of it, confirmation from the county when they have \nreceived my ballot, and confirmation when my ballot has been counted.\n  It is a great tool for administrators because you can identify \nbottlenecks in the delivery service, and you can go to a local branch \nand say: Hey, folks. Sorry. The Macy's catalog can wait another day. We \nhave to get these ballots out on time because election day deadlines \nare looming.\n  Then, for a voter to have that peace of mind that my ballot arrived \nand my vote was counted and my voice was heard, it is great for \ntransparency and great for public confidence in the electoral process. \nThat is what vote-by-mail provides.\n  So, similar to voter registration, with multiple, safe, secure \noptions, it should be the same with voting, with multiple, safe, and \nsecure, proven options--all to help us live up to the obligation, the \nduty, to promote the exercise of our fundamental right to vote.\n  That is the opportunity that we have before us today, colleagues, \neither by approving the measure that has been sent over to us from the \nHouse, which encompasses both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John \nLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, or if we can't do it consistent \nwith our current rules, then let's amend the Senate rules to allow us \nto do that--to protect the right to vote for all Americans--because our \nright to vote is under attack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I had the privilege to listen to my \ncolleague from California's oration and the privilege to hear many of \nthe things spoken, both by the President and by colleagues here in the \nSenate, as regards to the voting rights bill that is here before us \ntoday. I want to start off with the President's comments because I \nthink it frames the debate, if you will, in terms of how it is being \nframed to the American people.\n  The President considers Georgia's new law as Jim Crow. That is a \nmanipulative statement. It is a cynical statement. It tries to make \npeople think that 2022 is the same as 1965, which is laced with \nincredible irony, as our country has seen an African-American \nPresident, an African-American Vice President, and Lieutenant Governors \nof Virginia and Kentucky who are African American. Then, to brag of my \nown State, as long as things are being seen through certain prisms, we \nhave Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, who is ethnically from India, who was \nour Governor, and the first Vietnamese American elected to the U.S. \nCongress. In fact, Louisiana has had a White elected mayor of \npredominantly African-American New Orleans and a Black elected mayor of \npredominantly White Baton Rouge. But no, this statement is somehow \nmanipulating people to think that we are back in Bull Connor days.\n\n  Well, if this is Jim Crow, then States like Delaware must be Jim Crow \n2.0. Why is there not an outcry against Delaware?\n  I will point out that Georgia has more permissive voting laws than \nDelaware, more early voting days than Delaware, no-excuse absentee \nvoting, which, by the way, the voters of New York recently rejected. \nGeorgia now makes ballot drop boxes permanent, which was not the case \nbefore the pandemic. Much has been made about restricting the number of \ndrop boxes. I have been told that the one county pointed to is actually \na ruby red Republican county in which they dropped down to one.\n  If this is being done for partisan advantage, my gosh, they are not \ndoing a very good job of partisan maneuvering, but I would argue that \nthis bill is a wonderful example of partisan maneuvering.\n  What does it do? It is a Federal takeover of elections.\n  This innovation that the previous speaker, my colleague from \nCalifornia, was speaking of now has to run the gamut of a Federal \nofficial who says yea or who says nay.\n  It funnels tax dollars to fund political campaigns no matter how \nfringe that person's perspective might be, who no self-respecting donor \nwould give money to online or in person, but because of this law, my \ngosh, they have got a chance.\n  It bans commonsense voter ID laws. Now, there is this kind of myth \nbeing promulgated that States are putting up these onerous laws that \ncannot be complied with. Courts reject those laws. Courts do not allow \na State to use a mandated picture ID, issued by the State, as an ID, \nand to say so is manipulative. It is manipulative in the worst way. \nCourts decide the threshold, and courts decide what is reasonable and \nis unreasonable, and to suggest otherwise one more time is an attempt \nto manipulate people into thinking that 2022 is 1965, with all of the \nimplications thereof and all of the harm that does to our body politic. \nShame.\n  It also allows unlimited ballot harvesting--and, I think, California \nmight be the only State to have it in place--where you go to a homeless \nshelter and have people sign up who might be addicted, mentally ill, \nbrain damaged and have them sign for a certain candidate. Now, you can \nimagine a well-paid activist--because this bill allows activists to be \npaid--might discard those ballots which are not for her candidate and \nkeep only those for their own candidate. This bill requires that all 50 \nStates have it; whereas, in North Carolina, they actually booted a \ncandidate because he used ballot harvesting.\n  It also prohibits States from cleaning up their voter rolls. Now, \nsomehow, this is now wrong. I actually come from Louisiana, a State hit \nby Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After 2005, it was a tragedy for my \nState, but we had tens of thousands of people who moved to other \nStates. Now, at some point, they registered to vote in Atlanta or in \nHouston or in Dallas, and our secretary of state went back and said: \nHmm, you are on a voter roll in Louisiana, and you are on a voter roll \nin Georgia. It appears that you are now paying taxes in Georgia. We are \ngoing to drop you from our rolls.\n  Is anything wrong with that? Is anything wrong with pointing out that \nsomebody is registered to vote in two different States and then saying, \n``You are paying taxes there, so we are going to remove you from our \nrolls here''?\n  Lastly, I will say this: It puts Democrats in charge of the FEC, a \nneutral organization enforcing voter laws. I can imagine, as soon as \nRepublicans take charge again, we are going to do the same thing back \nto the other side. We are going to attempt to manipulate voting laws to \nour advantage, and it is not above either party to do that. So--I hate \nto use this word, but to sanctimoniously declare that this bill is the \nend of history; that partisanship is behind us; that, by golly, these \nlaws are going to be put in place, and forever after, we are going to \nlive harmoniously, is to not understand Washington, DC, where every \nedge is sought, and whenever it is sought, it is exploited to keep your \nparticular party in power.\n\n  I say this as a Republican: I don't trust my party any more than I \ntrust their party. I trust the States and the courts to oversee them, \nbut this bill usurps that responsibility.\n  Now, you can say that maybe this power grab is merely in place to \ndistract from real issues, and there is something to be said to that. \nWe are debating this--whether or not to require all 50 States to allow \nballot harvesting--when we have the highest rate of inflation than we \nhave had in over 40 years; when Russians are about to invade Ukraine, \napparently; when there are people pouring across our southern border \nand there is a looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the COVID \nresponse is kind of being caught up with, not being preemptively \naddressed, and we are discussing this.\n\n\n                               Filibuster\n\n  Mr. President, let me mention one more thing--the filibuster.\n  I was in an interview today about the surprise medical billing bill. \nMy colleague from New Hampshire, who I think was in the Chamber \nearlier, helped to put that together. Multiple\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\ncolleagues ended up coming together on that. It took us 2 to 3 years to \nget it done, the surprise medical billing. As of January 1 of this \nyear, if you get a surprise medical bill, there is a 1-800 number to \ncall, and you get help.\n  Why did it take us 2 years? We had to listen to stakeholders. We had \nto get legislation that works for all. We had to go to this Republican, \nthat Democrat, this committee in the Senate, that committee in the \nHouse; working with a broad coalition; even maybe, at the end, it \nslipping away; but we managed to pull it together, and we passed \nsurprise medical billing, and it was better because of that process.\n  Now, that is in contrast to a bill in which a majority of Democrats \nin the House and the Senate, with the President, can force through \nwithout any input from Republicans, from the 50 percent of the United \nStates that voted for the other side. Well, let's guess whose advantage \nthat bill is going to be for. It doesn't take much to imagine.\n  What Mitt Romney said on the Sunday morning show--did the White House \never call you about this voting bill? Mitt Romney said: Never called \nme. That made it clear there was no effort to make this bipartisan.\n  We are going to break this 200-year-old filibuster that requires us \nto come together to find common ground--that gives us bills that are \nstronger because of it--because of a desire for partisan advantage and \nknowing that once we break it and Republicans take it back, we are \ngoing to use it the same way. This is wrong. This is wrong for our \ncountry. It is wrong for our institution. I suppose that is why 16 of \nmy Democratic colleagues signed a letter last year--when, by the way, \nRepublicans were in control--saying that we should preserve the \nfilibuster.\n  It was recently stated that there is a disease of division infecting \nour country. That is true. And blowing up the filibuster removes one of \nthe last things that make us come together. That is wrong, and that \nwill be tragic, however--however--it is framed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I request a brief opportunity to respond \nsince my name and my State were invoked by Senator Cassidy on this--you \nhave got to give Republicans points for creativity on their \nterminology--some type of ballot harvesting. Let me tell you \nspecifically what he is referencing because, again, different States \nhave different rules and different histories.\n  In my speech, I talked about vote-by-mail. In California, we have \nseen the wisdom of every eligible voter automatically receiving a \nballot in the mail with multiple options for how to return their \nballot, including in person if that is their choice, through the Postal \nService if that is their choice, through ballot drop boxes if that is \ntheir choice.\n  If, after all that--in-person early voting, election day, vote-by-\nmail, Postal Service, drop boxes--if, after all of that, a voter \ndecides for themselves that they need or would like assistance with \nreturning their ballot, that is the voter's prerogative.\n  Imagine that--asking a family member, a neighbor, or a friend: Can \nyou do me a favor? Can you make sure this gets to a mailbox or the \npolling place in time for my vote to be counted?\n  Yes, there is a requirement in California that if you are somebody \nassisting a voter with returning their vote-by-mail ballot, you, too, \nhave to sign that return envelope, the official return envelope, and \nyour relationship with the voter--relative, friend, neighbor, et \ncetera.\n  Imagine that--empowering voters to decide for themselves how to \nreturn their ballot. That is what it is. They don't call it ballot \nharvesting because--once again, what are Republicans proving time and \nagain they are interested in doing? Making it harder for eligible \npeople to register to vote, stay registered to vote, and actually cast \ntheir ballot.\n  I just wanted to clarify what it is that we are talking about here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification from my \ncolleague from California.\n  Mr. President, let me say what a privilege it is to have the \nopportunity to make this speech in front of you, the fifth longest \nserving Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate--somebody who has \nbeen in the Senate for 46 years. I was 11 when you came to the U.S. \nSenate, and I am not a young man anymore. I am 57 years old.\n  Mr. KING. You are young.\n  Mr. BENNET. Somebody said: ``You are young.'' Only in the U.S. Senate \nwould that be true.\n  But I know the Presiding Officer, who is the chair of the important \nAppropriations Committee, is retiring this year. I was sitting here as \nI was getting ready to speak, thinking that you have seen it all, Mr. \nPresident. You have seen it all.\n  Unlike almost anybody else in this Chamber, you have actually seen a \nfunctioning U.S. Senate. You have seen the Senate where the floor was \nfilled with people having a debate; where filibusters actually had to \nhappen out in public, not in secret in a Senator's office; where people \nwere not spending 80 percent of their time in call rooms fundraising \ninstead of being out here on the floor doing the American people's \nbusiness, as Senators will see; that actually passed important pieces \nof legislation that made a difference to the American people and made \nour country more competitive, made us stronger. You are one of the last \npeople here who saw a Senate that worked like that.\n  The Republican leader has been here long enough to have seen a Senate \nthat worked like that.\n  You were here, I am sure--I know you were, Mr. President--in 2006 \nwhen you were passing the Voting Rights Act here with 98 votes. Ninety-\neight to zero the Voting Rights Act passed in 2006.\n  The Republican leader of the Senate then, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, voted for that bill. It wasn't even close, \nfrom his perspective. I have a number of quotes from him, but one was \n``The Voting Rights Act has proved to be a success for America'' and \nhas ``brought about greater justice for all.''\n  Amen, Leader McConnell, taking that principled position in 2006. It \nwas part of an honorable tradition that the Republican Party has had in \nthis country going back really to Abraham Lincoln and the votes that \nwere taken here to put Reconstruction in place, to fight the redeemers. \nIt was true in 1965 when they passed the Voting Rights Act by 77 to 19 \non this floor. Lyndon Johnson could not have done that without Everett \nDirksen, a Republican, the Republican leader, who was for that.\n  As you know, I say to the Presiding Officer, because you saw it--you \nprobably were there--four Republican Presidents--Nixon, Ford, Reagan, \nand George W. Bush--all signed versions of the Voting Rights Act. They \nshowed the country every time they did it that there is nothing \npartisan about voting rights.\n  Senator McConnell said:\n\n       [O]ur country will and must continue its progress toward a \n     society in which every person, of every background, can \n     realize the American Dream. With the passage of the Voting \n     Rights Act, we are reaffirming that Dream.\n\n  He was right back then when he said that, but today, he is leading \nthe blockade.\n  There are 16 Republican Senators here who voted for the Voting Rights \nAct back then in 2006, and today, they are all part of this blockade. \nWhat has changed? What has changed?\n  One of the things that changed was the Supreme Court's decision in \nthe Shelby case that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act by getting rid \nof preclearance for States that had historically discriminated against \nAfrican-American people, among others.\n  But do you know what is interesting about that, I say to the \nPresiding Officer? The Supreme Court said in that decision that \nCongress can fix this problem. We have a constitutional problem, but \nCongress can fix this problem.\n  That is exactly the same thing they said, by the way, when they wrote \nthat horrendous decision in Citizens United. They said that Congress \ncan fix this problem. But they may not have detected the paralysis that \nnow exists--not in Pat Leahy's Senate from when the Presiding Officer \ngot here but in Mitch McConnell's Senate today, in the modern-day \nSenate where people are willing to let a decision like Shelby\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\njust lie, not address it; where people are willing to accept a decision \nlike Citizens United that says that we are going to let billionaires \nbuy elections in this country instead of favoring people's right to \nvote. And we, the Congress, won't do anything about it even when the \nSupreme Court tells us we could do something about it.\n  I think it is worth quoting the Notorious RBG in her dissent in that \ncase, in the Shelby case, when she said that ``throwing out \npreclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop \ndiscriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a \nrainstorm because you are not getting wet.''\n  She was 100 percent right. State after State after State started to \nadopt restrictive voting statutes.\n  Last July, the Supreme Court issued another opinion that makes it \nharder to challenge State laws that disproportionately hurt certain \nvoters.\n  By the way, none of this could have come at a worst time because we \nhave a former President traversing the United States of America, \nperpetrating the Big Lie that he didn't lose the election, that the \nelection was stolen from him, that Joe Biden is not the legitimate \nPresident of the United States. There are politicians, I am sad to say, \nelected leaders all over this Nation, who are parroting--including in \nthis Chamber--that Big Lie when they know that it is a lie, when they \nknow that it is false, who are unwilling, as Mitt Romney said, to \nrespect their own voters enough that they actually tell them the truth.\n  In every State except one--I say to Senator Leahy, it is your State, \nVermont--in every State except yours, people are introducing \nlegislation to take away the vote of other people. There are 500 such \nbills.\n  Arizona has adopted changes that would purge up to 150,000 voters \nfrom the rolls.\n  Montana has gotten rid of same-day voter registration to make it \nharder for students.\n  Texas is down to one drop box per county. In Harris County, a \ncounty--I am sorry to say to my friend Sheldon Whitehouse--that is \nactually larger than Rhode Island, that means there is a drop box for \n2.5 million voters.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you for using us as a unit of measure.\n  Mr. BENNET. I am glad to use Rhode Island as a unit of measure. It is \nalso smaller than a number of Colorado counties, but it has its charm. \nIt has its charm. It has water, which we don't have in the State of \nColorado.\n  But just let me say--because I am here with my colleague from \nColorado who, when he was Governor, did a lot to make sure that people \nwould have the right to vote in our State--in contrast to Houston, \nwhere there is 1 drop box, in my hometown of Denver, where there are \n500,000 registered voters, we have 40 drop boxes in Denver. We are a \nlot smaller. We have 40 times the number of drop boxes that they have \nin Houston.\n  After Georgia's Republican secretary of state refused to buckle to \nPresident Trump's demand to find, somehow, another 11,000 votes--you \nremember the phone call. I am not making it up. You heard it with your \nown ears.\n  He called him up, and he said: Well, find 11,000 votes.\n  The guy said: No, I am not going to do that.\n  Now the legislature has removed him from the State election board.\n  So this isn't just about making it harder for people to vote, \nalthough it is making it harder for people to vote; this is shoring up \nthe soft spots that prevented Donald Trump from being able to assert, \ncredibly, that somehow the election had been stolen from him.\n  So 1 year after January 6 happened--1 year after this Capitol was \ninvaded, 1 year after there was a guy in horns standing up on the top \nof that Gallery behind me--the majority leader who once came to this \nfloor to proclaim the importance of the Voting Rights Act is saying \nthat this is all a ``fake panic.'' That is the language he used today.\n  Boy, given what we are seeing in this country, if we ever needed him \nto summon the principle that he articulated or espoused in 2006, Mr. \nPresident, when you were here, it is now. It is now. That is an \nimportant principle to defend.\n  So he comes to the floor today and says: I am going to defend the \nSenate. That is what I am here to do. I am here to defend the Senate.\n  Let me say something that might offend you, Mr. President. And I \ndon't mean to offend you, and I apologize if it offends you. But no one \nin America knows what the cloture rule is. No one. No one in America. \nMy mom doesn't know what the cloture rule is, and she is a pretty close \nwatcher of the Senate. No one knows what the cloture rule is.\n  No one in America knows, I would assert, what the filibuster is. But \nlet me tell you what it is--not what it says; what it is. It is a rule \nthat was created to let 60 Senators cut off debate so 51 Senators could \nmake a decision that has been warped into a rule that allows 41 \nSenators to stop any debate and prevent the Senate from ever having a \nvote.\n  That is what the cloture rule is. That is not what it says, but that \nis what it is, which is why every time you turn your television set on \nat home, you see a crawl at the bottom of your screen that says \n``Quorum Call,'' and you can't find a U.S. Senator anywhere because \nthey are probably back in a phone booth making fundraising phone calls.\n  Until this century, there was virtually not any filibuster used.\n  By the way, I should say how much I appreciate Senator Thune coming \nto the floor here today and saying that President Trump lost the \nelection. I appreciate it. I really do. He is an honorable person.\n  But it is important to know that one place the filibuster does not \nexist is in the U.S. Constitution. For most of the country's history, \nwe never had the filibuster. It was almost never used until the modern \nera.\n  When I got here in President Obama's first term, the Republican \nleader, Mitch McConnell, used the filibuster a record number of times. \nHe filibustered everything in his attempt to first make Barack Obama a \none-term President and then basically to bring down his Presidency.\n  He came out to the floor the other day and he said: ``Sometimes the \neffect of the filibuster is to block bills outright.'' Sometimes? \nSometimes? It happens all the time. This is why we never do anything. \nThis is why we can't make decisions. This is why we can't even have \ndebates.\n  The American people have no idea whom to blame. They don't know \nbecause no one in America knows what the cloture rule is. And when they \nelect a majority and they expect things to get done, they don't get \ndone.\n  Senator McConnell argues that the filibuster ``gives all kinds of \ncitizens and all kinds of States a meaningful voice in nearly \neverything we do.'' We have heard that over and over again today--the \nvoice that somehow we are shutting out.\n  I haven't met anybody who thinks that their voice is meaningfully \nrepresented in the U.S. Senate instead of special interests or the most \npowerful people--nobody--and it is because we can't have a debate on \nanything they care about.\n  Take background checks. Eighty-four percent of voters, including 77 \npercent of Republicans, support them. We can't even have a debate on \nthe floor.\n  Let Medicare negotiate drug prices on behalf of people. Seventy-seven \npercent of the American people support that. We can't even have a \ndebate here.\n  Seventy-four percent of people support the Dreamers--something \nSenator Durbin has been working on for a million years since you have \nbeen here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Two million.\n  Mr. BENNET. And we can't get a vote on that.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act. Seventy percent of all voters, including 54 \npercent of Republicans, support it.\n  All of them have been blocked by Senator McConnell and his abuse of \nthe Senate rules--not some great, venerable tradition of the U.S. \nSenate but his modern-day abuse, his caricature of the Senate rules. \nAnd it has created a minority veto--something that the Founders of this \ncountry would never ever in a million years have imagined that this \nplace would be perverted into. They knew the trouble that would cause \nbecause they had had the Articles of Confederation, which is what they \nwere trying to replace at the Constitutional Convention.\n  I am coming to an end, so I apologize to colleagues. But let me just \nsay, none of this has stopped us from cutting\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\ntaxes by $8 trillion, mostly for the wealthiest people in this country, \nand none of this has stopped us from putting lots of rightwing judges \non the court when Donald Trump was here because you can do those things \nwith 51 votes. That is about the extent of Senator McConnell's \nlegislative agenda, so I am not surprised that he prefers the status \nquo. But for the majority of Americans who believe that the next \ngeneration actually demands something greater than that from the Senate \nand from all of us, from each of us, we need a Senate that works.\n  Mr. President, think about this. Think about this. It is easy to \nforget. The Clean Water Act of 1972 passed 74 to 0.\n  By the way, I worked with the Senator from Louisiana on that surprise \nmedical bill. I am proud of that bill, but it is not the Clean Water \nAct of 1972.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 91 to 6; the children's \nhealth insurance plan, 85 to 15 in 1997; comprehensive immigration \nreform--we were part of that effort--68 votes in the Senate before it \ncompletely collapsed into smithereens; and, of course, the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Does anybody think--Mr. \nPresident, do you think that any of those bills would pass with a \nbipartisan majority like that today? Not a single one. We wouldn't even \nget to the vote.\n  We are still on a temporary budget. I don't need to tell you, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, that we haven't passed any of \nthe 12 appropriations bills this year. We have taken three times as \nlong to confirm President Biden's nominees--103 days--compared to \nPresident Reagan. This is no way to compete in the world, Mr. \nPresident. This is no way to compete with the Chinese Government's \ntotalitarian approach to humanity.\n  I know we can compete, but we have to restore the Senate, and the \nmost basic part of our job is protecting the right to vote. That is why \nwe are here. Every American should be able to vote like we do in \nColorado, thanks to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Hickenlooper, \nand what he did when he was Governor.\n  As Dr. King said, ``The history of our Nation is the history of a \nlong and tireless effort to broaden . . . the franchise of American \ncitizens.'' That is what this bill is about--to broaden the franchise \nof American citizens.\n  If we look back at our history, this is only the latest example of \nhow the Senate has impeded American progress, and it wouldn't be the \nfirst time that the Senate rules were changed in response to that.\n  Before the Civil War--a time even before you were in the Senate, Mr. \nPresident--the Senate sheltered the minority interests of slaveholders \non this floor. After the war, it enabled monopolists and robber barons \nand isolationists to profit from the misery of the conflict and its \naftermath.\n  Each time in our country's history, crises forced the Senate to \nfundamentally change the way it worked, and each change has led to \nmeaningful progress, including clearing the way for the passage of the \n14th and 15th Amendments to emancipate and enfranchise former slaves, \nsweeping antitrust reforms, and long-delayed legislation to protect \ncivil rights.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate rules are not suspended in amber, \nespecially when they are being abused the way they are being abused \ntoday. They can and they always have changed with the times.\n  Finally, let me say this: As we consider these reforms, the last \nthing we should do is make another House of Representatives. That is \nnot what I want to do. I want to have a Senate where you have to come \nout here and debate; where you can't filibuster in secret in your \noffice but you have to be out here to persuade the American people of \nthe righteousness of your cause; where the minority has the right to \noffer amendments; and where, in the end, 51 Senators can actually make \na decision so that we can move this country forward and so that each \none of us, whether we are in the majority today or sometime in the \nminority, can live under the rules that we have constructed to make the \nSenate actually function for the American people.\n  That, Mr. President, I think is why most of us have been sent here, \nand it is what I hope we are going to accomplish today. If we don't, we \nhave to keep fighting.\n  The Senator from Louisiana mentioned that this isn't 1965. Let me end \nby saying this: The economic gap between White Americans and Black \nAmericans is as great today as it was in 1968. That is a brutal fact \nabout the state of our economy, and it is why we need a Senate that \nactually can respond to the needs of the American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your patience and your \nindulgence. I apologize that you are having to consume part of your \nlast year listening to a yearslong speech.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to hear the other side talk--by ``the \nother side,'' I mean the Democrats--they would never dream of \nquestioning our democratic process. So I want to take you back in \nhistory just a little ways to just before the 2020 election.\n  Let's not forget the outlandish conspiracy theory promoted by leading \nDemocrats in the runup to the 2020 election that somehow the Postal \nService might not deliver absentee ballots.\n  Postmaster General DeJoy was slandered and slandered disgracefully \nbased on no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing. The Postmaster is \nhired by the Board of Governors of the Postal Service. He was neither \nappointed by President Trump, nor did he answer to President Trump. The \nfact that DeJoy had supported President Trump's election was just \nenough for the other side to concoct a highly implausible election-\ntampering plot.\n  Now, after the election of President Biden, we heard no more about \nthe problems of the Postal Service maybe not delivering mail. The \nnecessary business transformation initiated by Postmaster General DeJoy \nto make sure that the ballots did arrive to be counted on time--that \nbusiness transformation resumed after an election pause to allay \nirrational fears stirred up by partisans. We have heard precious little \nabout this alleged threat to democracy since the election. Now, had the \nelection gone differently, I suspect that we would have heard a lot \nmore.\n  However, the effect of that scare tactic still lingers to this very \nday. Along that line, I hear from Iowans who dropped off their absentee \nballots for the first time, scared that their vote would not have been \ncounted if mailed because of that conspiracy theory against DeJoy that \nsomehow the Postal Service was going to make sure a Democrat ballot \ndidn't get delivered.\n  My State of Iowa is one of the few States that use the Postal \nService's Intelligent bar code on ballot envelopes. That helps the \nPostal Service expedite the ballots and allows Iowans to track their \nballot until it is delivered to the county auditors. Iowans continue to \nbe able to vote absentee with great confidence that their vote will \ncount.\n  So it makes me very sad that some were convinced otherwise as part of \na political con game prior to the 2020 election. This denigrating of \nour election process for short-term political gain is disgraceful.\n  Now, I see the current false claims about State laws suppressing \nvotes in the same light. Whether Democrats believe their own talking \npoints or whether it is a cynical attempt to paint Republicans as anti-\nvoting, these false claims undermine faith in the democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I would like to go back a little further \nin history than last year's warmed-over conspiracy theories that we \njust heard my friend from Iowa talk about.\n  I so appreciated Senator Bennet's discussion of sort of the history \nof voting rights and the history of this body. The American public \ncertainly doesn't know what cloture means. The American public really \ndoesn't know all that much about the filibuster either.\n  But go back a few decades. The filibuster was used to suppress the \nvote. The filibuster was used by many people in my political party--\nback when too many Democrats were on the wrong side of history and the \nwrong side of civil rights--was used by southern segregationists. It \nwas finally overcome by some northern Republicans, with a whole bunch \nof northern Democrats.\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\n  But think about what else the filibuster has been used for. The \nfilibuster was used in the 1970s and 1980s to protect Big Tobacco in \nKentucky. The filibuster was used to protect Big Oil. Now, it is used \nto protect Wall Street. The filibuster is used to protect big tech \ncompanies. The filibuster is used in case after case after case to \nprotect big drug companies. So we know that the whole purpose of the \nfilibuster has been to protect the most affluent, the most privileged, \nthe wealthiest corporate interests in this society that just get their \nway in this body day after day, week after week, month after month, \nyear after year.\n  Now, this weekend--and many referred to this--we honored Dr. Martin \nLuther King. We heard a lot of words extolling his legacy. Those words \nfrom many who are for whatever reason not supporting voting rights \ntoday--those words sounded pretty empty.\n  Few people told the story of Dr. King in Memphis, why Dr. King was in \nMemphis.\n  In early February of 1968, sanitation workers in Memphis--some of the \nmost abused, taken-advantage-of workers in our country; mostly Black \nworkers doing a dirty, difficult job in a segregated city with a very \nracist mayor, who let that be known in the ensuing months--these \nsanitation workers were not even given rest periods, particularly when \nthey were in White neighborhoods. There was nowhere to go when they \nwere picking up the garbage in White neighborhoods. There was no place \nto go for the rest periods.\n\n  Two workers in early February, in a rainstorm, got in their garbage \ntrucks to protect themselves from the rain for a few minutes. The \ngarbage truck malfunctioned. Those two workers--underpaid, with no real \nbenefits and no insurance and no help for their families--those two \nworkers were killed.\n  Dr. King went to Memphis the first time to help lead that strike, to \njoin the striking workers. The second time he went back, that is when \nhe was assassinated.\n  Dr. King understood that the dignity of work was intertwined with \nvoting rights. Worker rights and voting rights always went together. \nDr. King insisted that no job is menial if it pays a decent wage. Those \nsanitations workers, as I said--low wages, no benefits, no health \ninsurance, no retirement--none of that--and few days off.\n  Dr. King said:\n\n       What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an \n     integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to \n     buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?\n\n  He talked about the dignity of work--a term mostly popularized by \nhim--and he said no work is menial if it pays an adequate wage.\n  Until all workers have dignity in the job, Dr. King's work will \nremain unfinished. We can't get there if workers cannot vote. I don't \nmean just workers who put on a tie and sit at a desk; the vote should \nbe open to everyone--I mean all workers, whether you punch a clock, \nwhether you swipe a badge, whether you work for tips, whether you are \non salary, whether you are raising children, whether you are taking \ncare of aging parents.\n  We know who powers our economy. It is workers. It is not the rich \ndonors and the corporate contributors who fund the politicians who are \npushing for gerrymandering and voter suppression in the takeovers of \nlocal election borders; it is workers.\n  I think about what we did in the Senate last week--with some \ndifficulty, but ultimately, it worked. We unanimously passed a \nresolution honoring the custodians and the maintenance workers. We had \ntalked often about the police officers, some of whom gave their lives \nand dozens who were injured, all who were courageous. We honored them, \nas we should. We also, last week, though, passed a resolution honoring \ncustodial workers and maintenance workers. They get little recognition. \nThey work for too low pay.\n  Last January, 1 year ago, these workers--largely Black and Brown \nworkers, many of them immigrants--were forced to clean feces off the \nwall, clean up after the destruction of the White supremacists, and \nrestore dignity to our Capitol after domestic terrorists ransacked it. \nThe insurrectionists destroyed; the Black and Brown workers cleaned up. \nThe carpenters and the maintenance workers and the painters union \nmembers all rebuilt. Last week, we came together to honor their \nservice. They deserve more than words, more than gratitude.\n  So often, they and other working people don't have much of a voice in \nthis country. They don't have the high-priced lobbyists who come here. \nMany of you have looked down the hall and seen, in front of Senator \nMcConnell's office--you have seen the lobbyists lined up, who always \nseem to get what they come for. Workers don't have corporate lobbyists. \nThey aren't going on campaign donor retreats. But workers have the vote \nor should have the vote.\n  The voting booth is where all of us are supposed to have an equal \nvoice. The voting booth is where workers are supposed to be able to go \nto hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable. So it is not \nsurprising that politicians who pass corporate tax cuts--the same \npoliticians who do the handouts for the wealthiest 1 percent--don't \nwant lots of workers to vote.\n  We know whom voter suppression and election subversion is aimed at. \nIt is at the parents working two jobs to pay the rent and make sure \ntheir kids have a decent meal, with no control over their work lives \nand their work hours if they don't have a collective bargaining \nagreement. It is students. It is people who don't get a day off. It is \nseniors in nursing homes. It is home healthcare workers who care for \nthem. So often, these are women of color, working the graveyard shift \nafter coming straight from their second job.\n  We know whose votes these politicians want to throw out after they \nare cast. We know which cities the former President went after. One is \nPhiladelphia, PA, Senator Casey; and Atlanta, GA, Senators Ossoff and \nWarnock. What do they have in common? They are diverse places with a \nwhole lot of Black and Brown workers who cast ballots that the rich and \npowerful don't like.\n\n  Ultimately, as others have said, it comes down to this: These \npoliticians want to cherry-pick their voters rather than the voters \npicking their elected officials. Through gerrymandering, through voter \nsuppression, and through meddling in local election boards, politicians \nwant to pick and choose whose votes are counted.\n  President Trump carried my State twice by 8 points. My State, though, \nis about a 53, 54, 46, 47--slightly Republican State now. For the last \ndecade, the Members of Congress in my State--12 Republicans and 4 \nDemocrats in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, in 2018, and 2020. None of that \nchanged. Not one of those districts changed because Republicans, with \ntheir corruption and with their skill at drawing maps, drew those maps \nin ways that there were no real fair elections.\n  We know whose votes they don't want to count. It is the votes of the \nlow-paid and the overlooked; the votes of workers who power this \ncountry yet don't have much power; the votes of people who might hold \npoliticians accountable, who might demand fewer tax cuts for rich \npeople and an increase in the child tax credit and the earned-income \ntax credit, the largest tax cut for families in our Nation's history.\n  Ninety percent of families in Colorado, in Georgia, in New Jersey, in \nOhio, and all over this country--90 percent of families with children \nget at least a $3,000 tax cut because of what we did in this body when \nwe said: No more Republican freight trains carrying tax cuts down the \ntrack. We are going to give tax cuts to moderate-income people and \nworking families.\n  The votes of people who hold politicians accountable, the votes of \npeople who understand the dignity of work--if you say you support \nAmerican workers, you support their right to vote.\n  I ask my colleagues of both parties to come together to protect the \nright of every American to have a voice in this country no matter who \nyou are, no matter where you work, no matter where you live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I did not intend to speak today. I came \ndown here and listened to the speeches of some of my colleagues for 2 \nhours this morning and asked for an opportunity to get on the list of \nwhat are nearly 50 Senators who are going to speak today. But I heard \nloud and clear some of the comments. I just wanted to go back and \nrevisit them and talk about maybe\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nthe path forward after this vote occurs today and, I hope, fails to \nchange the filibuster rule.\n  I think Senator Tester was the one who said he knew of a voter who \nwaited 8 to 10 hours to vote. That is unacceptable. We need to change \nthat.\n  I would also say that probably over that 8 to 10 hours, they run a \nlong line--far beyond any restrictions they had for electioneering--so \nthey could have food and water.\n  Some people could have heard that speech and thought that someone was \nstarving or thirsting to death for 8 or 10 hours, but we all know that \nmost States have laws that allow anyone to provide food or water to \nothers 50 feet away from the election sites.\n  I know if you have ever been in elections, you have been there too. I \nhave been there handing out my push card, 50 feet out, handing people \nwater. That happens every day. The American people need to know that. \nAnd if there are States that have restrictions, that is something I \nhope I have a moment to talk about as we move forward.\n  We also heard Senator Klobuchar say that, 160 times, the rules have \nchanged. The fact of the matter is, they have never changed for the \nlegislative calendar, which is what we are talking about, without \nregular order. It happened seven times, and it happened because the \nmajority of Members, Democrats and Republicans, thought that we should \nmodernize the rules. But we did it through regular order. It has never \nbeen done before.\n  In fact, in two notable examples where the nuclear option was used \nwas once by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid and followed up by then-\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell. If that is not the best indicator of \nwhat will happen to this body, nothing is.\n  Remember when Senator Reid said: We are just going to carve out a \nlittle bit of the Executive Calendar to make it easier for district \njudges to get confirmed. That is all we are going to do.\n  Why on Earth does anybody believe that that carve-out wasn't going to \nresult in the ultimate nuclear option for the Executive Calendar? That \nis why you have Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice \nBarrett. That is why you have it. This is the political physics here. \nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n  And if you vote to nuke the legislative filibuster, you might as well \nbuild a wall straight down this body because anytime Democrats or \nRepublicans hit the trifecta and we have the White House and we have \nthe Senate and we have the House, the minority's voice will count for \nnothing. And, even worse, the voices of the vocal minority at either \nend of the political spectrum will have a disproportionate impact on \nwhat we vote on and pass out of this body.\n  If you think it is hard getting the voting rights bills passed today, \njust think how hard it is going to be for you to stand down your most \nextreme base--we have got our own--on things that are not good for this \ncountry that the vast majority of the American people will not support. \nWe will go to an every 2-year or 4-year cycle of huge swings for the \nfirst time ever in this Nation's history.\n  I hope that last week most of you had the opportunity--I was in the \nChamber, but if you weren't, I would ask you to go back and listen to \nSenator Sinema's speech. Some people would have just spiked the \nfootball on our side of the aisle saying: It looks like she will \npreserve the filibuster. We can move on.\n  What I heard was a Member calling on us to bridge the gap and make \nprogress. That is what I heard. And on voting rights, I think we can. I \nthink the American people need to know that if this fails today, it is \nnot the end of the discussion of progress we need to make.\n  My staff said: We don't want you to put this board up because we are \nafraid that will tip your hand on things you are having discussions on.\n  I have had a number of discussions with Members on the other side of \nthe aisle. We have legitimate problems that we need to fix. We need to \nmake it harder to cheat and easier to vote. We need to reform the \nElectoral Count Act. With all due respect to the majority leader, I \nthink that he said it is unacceptable and insufficient and even \noffensive, because he said: ``Scorekeeping matters little if the game \nis rigged.'' ``If the game is rigged''--that sounds like what President \nTrump was saying just about 18 months ago. Now, we have both sides of \nthe aisle talking about how ``the game is rigged.''\n  What we are doing is creating more discontent, and we are actually \nsuppressing people's interest in voting because they think their vote \nwon't count. That is what is being said in this Chamber today. That is \nwhat we have to stop. There are a number of things that we can do.\n  I voted against all of the objections of my seven Republican \ncolleagues on January 6. I stand by proud. I was proud to certify that \nelection. But since 2001, the Electoral Count Act has been weaponized. \nYou had 14 House Members object in 2021. You had 31 House Members and a \nSenate Member object in 2005. You had 7 House Members object in 2017. \nAnd we had 138 House Members and 7 Senate Members object in this last \nelection. It has clearly become weaponized. We clearly have to make it \nclear that the Vice President is in a ministerial position, and there \nshould be a higher bar for lodging an objection.\n  There are other things that we can do. The certifying agencies across \nthe States should say: You can't change the rules after the election is \nheld.\n  That is what we should be talking about. We should be talking about \nmaking it easier to vote.\n  I don't know why New York rejected, by a 58-to-42 margin, same-day \nregistration last year, but they did. The voters went to the polls. And \nI am reminded of you saying the legislature overturned it. So now, it \nis the legislature in New York that is going to overturn 58 percent \nagainst same-day registration and 54 percent against no-excuse absentee \nballot?\n  I have got no-excuse absentee ballots in North Carolina. I think we \nshould encourage more States to do the same.\n  So where does this need to head? After tensions cool and after what I \nhope is a failed vote to change the rules--and, incidentally, the day \nthat Republicans change the rule for the legislative filibuster is the \nday I resign from the Senate. And I believe that I have a number of \nMembers on my side of the aisle that would never do it. So you don't \nhave to worry about the argument, ``If you don't change it now, they \nwill change it when they hit the trifecta.'' It is not going to happen.\n  Senator Kaine, I think I was naive. When I signed that letter--after \nPresident Trump called for nuking the filibuster 34 times--I said: Get \nme on the letter to preserve the filibuster.\n  I went home, and I was attacked. I have had the protesters. I have \nhad the censure proposals in county GOPs and State GOPs. And I stand by \nit and I will stand by it as long as I am here. But I have to say I \nfeel a little bit disappointed and a little bit betrayed by the fact \nthat the 32 Members who signed it on the Democratic side, all but one \nnow say, Well, things have changed. They haven't changed. And we can't \nlet this filibuster change. We need to work on making it easier to \nvote. We need to work on making it harder to cheat.\n  There are reasonable solutions that I think most sides of the aisle \ncan agree to. And the American people need to know that there are \npeople like me and other Members that are going to fight for that after \nthis vote hopefully goes down today.\n  Let's not build a wall between our Chamber. Let's continue the \nrelationships that we have. I had five conversations with Members on \nthe other side of the aisle this morning, talking about legislation we \nare working on, a visit to North Carolina to spend some time together \noutside of the political cauldron that we are in here now, helping \nsomebody out with a vote in Judiciary for a judicial nominee that you \notherwise may be inclined to vote against. But let me tell you what. If \nyou want to destroy that opportunity moving forward, vote to nuke the \nfilibuster; vote to have any rational basis for working with Members \nwhen one of us hits the trifecta.\n\n  But I do hope, after this vote fails today, that Members will answer \nthe call to fix what is wrong with our system, fix the Electoral Count \nAct, make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President and colleagues, I am going to talk for \njust\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\na few minutes about vote-by-mail. I think Senator Klobuchar will \nprobably be joining me.\n  Madam President and colleagues, I am the first U.S. Senator to be \nelected completely by mail. The second U.S. Senator elected completely \nby mail was my friend, Republican Gordon Smith, a Senator well known to \nmany here in this body.\n  The country looked up and its first experience, colleagues, with \nvote-by-mail was thoroughly bipartisan--one Democrat, one Republican, \nwho, as it happened, after running against each other, got along very \nwell and did a lot together.\n  As the country began to get its arms around vote-by-mail, it was \nbipartisan and the bipartisan efforts to build on it really took off. \nThey took off all across the country until President Donald Trump got \nelected and began to spew all these lies about vote-by-mail. So then \nsomething that was completely bipartisan suddenly became very partisan. \nWhat I want to do is rebuild that bipartisanship. My colleagues seem to \nsay that is what they want. And the fact is, vote-by-mail is the gold \nstandard for casting an informed vote, particularly for working people, \nseniors, and others, who would like the time, the opportunity in their \nliving rooms and their kitchens, to look at the ballot and consider the \nvarious alternatives.\n  And in that effort now to undo the damage done by Donald Trump to \nvote-by-mail and in the name of restoring bipartisanship, which is what \nit is all about--and I can just tell my colleagues, our late secretary \nof state, Dennis Richardson, used to say he was about the most \nconservative person who ever lived. He basically told Donald Trump to \ngo fly a kite when it came to vote-by-mail. Dennis Richardson, our late \nsecretary of state, a staunch conservative, said the reality is there \nhadn't been fraud; it worked very effectively. You are off base.\n  So in the hope of being able to restore that bipartisanship, I want \nto ask a question of the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee. \nThen, I will wrap up very quickly, and we can move on. But we have had \nan awful lot of revisionist history with respect to vote-by-mail.\n  Senator Klobuchar, I know the Rules Committee, under your leadership, \nhas dug into the history. Utah--bright red Utah--votes by mail. Senator \nKlobuchar, take us through that history and then I will close.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Senator Wyden.\n  I want to thank you. Oregon was the first to use vote-by-mail for a \nFederal election. Although, I think Senator Padilla, a great member of \nthe Rules Committee from California, would tell you, in fact, that \nCalifornia and Washington first allowed any voter to request a mail-in \nballot in the 1970s.\n  But since then, what has happened? Utah, considered a red State by \nall accounts has mail-in balloting for nearly all of their voters. We \nhave seen this across the country.\n  Today, 34 States allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot. During \nthe pandemic, 45 States actually allowed this to happen without an \nexcuse. What happened during the pandemic is that we saw 11 States that \ndidn't typically allow all voters to request a mail-in ballot do so.\n  Sadly, 10 of them have already started rolling this back for the next \nelection. We know that this is a really safe and good way to vote, \nwhether there is a pandemic or there isn't a pandemic. And the key is \nvoters got used to it, they liked it, and attempts to roll this back \nand to make it harder to vote are the wrong way to go for our country.\n  And, instead, we should be assuring everyone that regardless of their \nZIP Code, regardless of their State, they should be able to vote by \nmail.\n  Thank you for the question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me close very quickly.\n  The fact is, we can bring about the bipartisanship that many of my \nRepublican colleagues have been talking about over the last 4\\1/2\\ \nhours. It is doable. It is possible to do it in a way that builds on a \npractical gold standard for informed voting used in Oregon, used in \nbright-red Utah, and it is what we had until 2020, when Donald Trump \ntried to preempt the progress we were making because, in every rally, \nhe would talk about all this fraud, for example. Fraud, Madam \nPresident--the last analysis of fraud in Oregon is 0.00001 percent of \nall votes cast.\n\n  So we can get back to what the Republicans have been talking about \nover the last 4\\1/2\\ hours, but the way you are going to have to do it \nis they are going to have to go to Donald Trump and tell him: Look, we \njust don't agree with you on this.\n  And that is the kind of leadership that we need. We saw it in Oregon. \nWe saw it in Utah. We have seen it now from sea to shining sea. That is \nwhat it is going to take.\n  I want my Republican colleagues to know that we will meet them more \nthan half way, but they are going to have to start taking on Donald \nTrump's lies on these issues if we are going to have that \nbipartisanship that my colleagues have been talking about this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, this past weekend is our annual \nreminder as a country of the courage, suffering, sacrifice, passion, \nlove, and energy that so many of our fellow Americans put into \nprotecting our democracy.\n  When in a democracy, one group of citizens can deliberately, \npurposefully make it more difficult for another group of citizens to \nvote, they have put a dagger into that democracy. We cannot let that \nhappen.\n  I am here today to focus, in particular, on one voting right that we \nhave in this country, and that voting right is, when you are voting, to \nknow what the hell is going on around you in that election, to know who \nis saying what, to know who the players are around you. If we are \nsupposed to sit here, as Americans, and just act like indolent \nconsumers, passive in this democracy, that is not the way it is \nsupposed to work. Citizenship is an office, and that office has duties, \nand the duties include being informed of what is going on around you.\n  And what is stopping American citizens from knowing what is going on \naround them is the cascade, the torrent, the Nile River of dark money \nthat has begun to flow into our democracy since Citizens United.\n  It wasn't enough that the Republican Members of the Court let \nunlimited money flow. They then had to refuse to react when that \nunlimited dark money went underground, when it went dark, when it \nbecame anonymous.\n  They have had chance after chance to fix it and they refuse and we \nare left with this mess. It matters that citizens know who is talking \nin a democracy.\n  In my circuit, the First Circuit Court of Appeals--where Jack Reed \nand I have the honor, occasionally, to recommend nominees to the \nPresident--there is a judge who I believe is the dean of the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals named Bruce Selya. He is a Rhode Islander. He \nwas a Reagan appointee. He is a Republican. He is a very distinguished \njudge. And he has said: It is crucial that the electorate can \nunderstand who is speaking and, thus, to give proper weight to \ndifferent speakers and messages when deciding how to vote.\n  That crucial right is denied to Americans wholesale because of an \nunprecedented dark money campaign of interference in our democracy.\n  You see it whenever it is election season. You are watching a \ntelevision show and suddenly your TV screen is occupied by an \nadvertisement that tells you that somebody is a bum, that somebody is \nno good, that somebody is terrible, that smears them. And at the end it \nsays, ``This advertisement was brought to you by Americans for peace \nand puppies and prosperity,'' some completely imaginary group that was \ncooked up just to launch those advertisements, and whatever filth those \nadvertisements contain is then disappeared with the end of that front \ngroup.\n  It is the political equivalent of toilet paper. You flush it when you \nare done with the filth, and whoever is behind it keeps their hands \nclean.\n  So we now have a tsunami of slime--as one writer put it--flowing \nthrough our country, and it is denying our citizens the most \nfundamental right they have when they vote, which is to know who the \nactors are and who is doing what to whom.\n  Well, in this bill is the DISCLOSE Act that would fix that. If you \nspend more than 10 grand in an election, you\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nhave to report it. And I don't care how many shell corporations and \ndonors trusts and phony 501(c)(4)s you line up to blockade your \nidentity, our bill will get through it.\n  It superdrills through however many screens you put up, and the \nAmerican public will, at last, once again, know who is really talking \nto them in their elections. Dark money takes away voters' rights to \nknow who is talking to them and what is going on in their democracy. It \nis a fundamental right.\n  And, unfortunately, it doesn't end there because the other rights \nthat my colleagues have so eloquently talked about--to get to the \nballot, to be treated fairly at the ballot, to not be harassed on the \nway to the ballot, to be able to get a ballot mailed to you--the \nRepublican efforts around the country to attack those rights, to \nsuppress votes those ways, do you know how that is being done? It is \nbeing done with dark money.\n  We know it because they have been caught. It is not a matter of \ndebate or dispute. When these enterprises are set up to deprive--what \nReverend Warnock calls ``some people''--some people of their right to \nvote, and when the laws are done so that that is accomplished against, \nparticularly, African-American voters with what one court called \n``surgical precision,'' that is not happening at random. It is \nhappening because enormous amounts of anonymous money are flowing into \ngroups to make it happen.\n  And I will close with two examples. One is called Heritage Action, \nwhich is--the current state of the art on this is you set up a phony \n501(c)(3) and a phony 501(c)(4), and they are a pair. And the money to \nthe 501(c)(3) is deductible, and the political dirty work is done by \nthe 501(c)(4).\n  And Heritage Foundation, which we have all heard about, is the \n501(c)(3), and Heritage Action is its 501(c)(4). And Heritage Action \nwas recorded talking to its secret donors.\n  And the person who was making the presentation to the secret donors \nin April of 2021 said:\n\n       We worked quietly with the . . . legislature. We got the \n     best practices to them. We helped draft the bills. We made \n     sure activists were calling the state legislators, getting \n     support, showing up at their public hearings, giving \n     testimony.\n       In some cases, we actually [drafted the bills] for them or \n     we have a sentinel--\n\n  Think about that word for a minute, a ``sentinel''--\n\n     on our behalf give them the model legislation so it has that \n     grassroots, from-the-bottom-up type of vibe.\n\n  She said: And we did this with ``little fanfare. Honestly, nobody \neven noticed. My team looked at each other and we're like, `It can't be \nthat easy.'''\n  Well, the DISCLOSE Act will stop it from being that easy to have an \nout-of-state, dark money campaign take a State legislature and get them \nto pass voter suppression laws without the State legislatures even \nknowing who is behind them. And that is on tape. I am not making this \nup.\n  The other one that is always worth looking at are our friends at the \nHonest Elections Project, which actually doesn't exist. What exists is \nsomething called the 85 Fund. And the 85 Fund is allowed, under \nVirginia law, Senator Kaine, to have a fictitious name and to operate \nas if it were operating under its fictitious name.\n  And it has several, one is the Judicial Crisis Network, which we all \nknow helped stock the Court with rightwing judges, but another one is \nthe Honest Elections Project. The Honest Elections Project and the \nHonest Election Project Action are the pair that work on this.\n  Money has poured into this effort, and the Honest Elections Project \nhas been smack in the middle of it. In 2012, 77 percent of its money \ncame through donors' trusts, which is a great identity-laundering \ndevice for rightwing dark money; in 2013, 96 percent; in 2014, 88 \npercent; in 2015, 84 percent; in 2016, 82.6 percent; in 2017, 93 \npercent; in 2018, 88.8 percent; and in 2020, the year that the Honest \nElections Project waged dark money voter suppression, the 85 Fund \nreceived over $45 million, identity laundered through donors' trusts. \nAnd much of that money came from one single $19 million contribution. \nSomebody wrote a $19 million check to suppress votes.\n  Folks, if we don't get to the bottom of this, we are going to have a \nreal problem on our hands. And when we get to the bottom of this, the \nAmerican public will be with us because they hate this stuff. You can \nbe a Bernie Bro or you can be a Tea Partier and you can disagree on \neverything, and you agree that big dark money corruption has no place \nin American democracy.\n  This is the issue where Senator McConnell's political minions met \nwith the Koch brothers' political minions, and they did whatever \n``minioning'' they do together. And their conversation got out to Jane \nMayer, who wrote about it, and this was the issue that they said to \neach other: We can't dirty this up. No matter how hard we try to put a \ngood spin on this, voters hate dark money corruption. Our voters hate \nit just as much as their voters.\n  So this is our chance to fix this to take out the dark money behind \nthe voter suppression effort in all these States.\n  This isn't happening, folks. It is being done. And we have got to pay \nattention to who is doing it. And when we do, we will restore that \nfundamental voting right of all Americans to know who is talking to \nthem in their elections--to have ours be a democracy without masks, \nwithout subterfuge, and without dark money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield just for a brief comment?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Gladly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to thank Senator Whitehouse. He has been a \nleader on this issue. It doesn't get enough attention. It is very much \npart of our bill, the Freedom to Vote Act. It is universally or \nvirtually universally supported, and it is one of the great scourges of \nour politics.\n  If we don't move forward on these bills, we are not going to be able \nto do this because we will not get the kind of bipartisan cooperation \nwe need on this horrible, horrible thing that I think all 50 of us \nagree should be changed.\n  So I want to thank him for his efforts--not just his speech today but \nhis amazing efforts over the months and years.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Leader. Much appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank you, Madam President, for the \nopportunity to talk about something really important to all Americans \nbut specifically important to Americans from the Deep South who happen \nto look like me.\n  As I listened to the President talk about the importance of stopping \nwhat he characterized as Jim Crow 2.0, I felt frustration and \nirritation rising in my soul. As I keep hearing the references to Jim \nCrow, I ask myself how many Americans understand what Jim Crow was. I \nam so thankful--thankful--that we are not living in those days.\n  But just for those who don't appreciate the Jim Crow that was, it was \na time when my grandfather, born in 1921, would have experienced it. If \nhe were still alive, he could tell the stories of the Jim Crow South \nand the Jim Crow era, an era where, in order for a black person to \nvote, you had to pass a literacy test.\n  Now, if you could read at that point, it would not just be a test on \nwhether or not you could read, it would be a test on ``Do you know who \nyour Governor was 20 years before you were getting ready to vote?'' It \nwould include the threat of being lynched--literally killed--because \nthose in power wanted to stop Black folks from realizing and fully \nparticipating in the greatest Nation on Earth and exercising what I \nbelieve is a fundamental responsibility and right of Americans, the \nright to vote.\n  It would include beatings and the power of intimidation, the loss of \nyour job if you dared to show up to vote. And so when I hear my \nPresident, your President, our President of these United States, just a \nlittle while ago, a week or so ago, talk about Jim Crow 2.0 and using \nas the poster child of this new Jim Crow South being the Georgia voting \nlaw, I rushed to read the law one more time so that I could understand \nwhat in the world is he talking about.\n  I am here this afternoon because I had a conversation with the South \nCarolina NAACP about 2 hours ago, and they encouraged me to come to the \nfloor and make my comments as public as possible so that people \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nwhat I have read in the Georgia law and compare it to the Jim Crow \nSouth.\n  So what we know about the Georgia law--and I have read the law--what \nwe know about the Georgia law is the controversies the President spoke \nabout and that we have heard Members of Congress speak about over the \nweekend is it is illegal to get water while waiting to vote.\n  Now, that claim has been proven false. It is not illegal to get water \nwhile waiting in line. That is false. The only time you can't get water \nwhile waiting in line to vote, according to the Georgia law, is if it \nis a partisan; someone campaigning for someone--campaigning for \nsomeone--you can't bring them water. But if you are an election worker \nor a relative, you can, of course, bring a person water. So that was \ncompletely false.\n  But if that is the threshold of the new Jim Crow era, it looks \nnothing like the past. However, even that is false. What else is in \nthat Georgia law that is supposedly the poster child of voter \nsuppression? It allows for early voting, to include now the Souls to \nthe Polls, where you have Sundays where you can vote early--as a matter \nof fact, 17 days of early voting, more early voting than the \nPresident's own home State or New York.\n  It allows for mail-in ballots without an excuse, the same thing that \nwas turned down by the voters in New York. No-excuse, on-demand, mail-\nin ballots is now the law in Georgia.\n  New drop boxes. Prepandemic there was--it was not legal to have a \ndrop box in Georgia. Now, it is legal to have a drop box in Georgia and \nvoter ID, supported by at least 60 percent of African Americans, 60 \npercent of Hispanics, 60 percent or more of the majority population.\n  After going through point by point and realizing in South Carolina \nthat minority turnout was stronger than the overall turnout in South \nCarolina and that two of the three African-American Senators in the \nU.S. Senate today--two of us--represent those Southern States, it is \nhard to deny progress when two of the three come from the Southern \nStates that people say are the places where African-American votes are \nbeing suppressed, not to mention the fact that 2020 was a banner year \nfor minority participation in the greatest Nation on Earth from a \nvoting perspective, and that is, my friends, good news.\n  The Democrats' proposal would allow for the supporters of Bernie \nSanders and their tax dollars to go into my reelection account; I \noppose that. It would undermine voter ID laws across our country; I \noppose that. It puts unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of our \nelections; Americans oppose that. And walking in on the day of the \nelection, registering to vote without any verification, is something I, \ntoo, oppose.\n  And so, when I think about the important issue of voting and when I \nthink about the issue of voter suppression, it lands on my front porch \nbecause, as a guy who has voted in the Deep South all my life, as a \nperson who was born in 1965 with a mama who understands racism, \ndiscrimination, and ``separate and not equal,'' with a grandfather who \nI took to vote and helped him cast his vote because he was unable to \nread, to have a conversation in a narrative that is blatantly false is \noffensive, not just to me or southern Americans but offensive to \nmillions of Americans who fought, bled, and died for the right to vote.\n  So if we are going to have an honest conversation about the right to \nvote, let's engage on that based on the facts of the laws that are \nbeing passed, not the rhetoric surrounding those laws, where it looks \nlike power is more important than people.\n  I will close with this. The Civil War of this Nation started in my \nhometown. One of the most powerful and popular Senators in the history \nof America was Strom Thurmond. In 2010, when I ran for Congress, I ran \nfor Congress in the place where the Civil War started, and I ran for \nCongress in a Republican primary against the son of Strom Thurmond. I \nwon that race, not merely because of who I am but because of who we \nhave become as a Nation.\n  The evolution of the heart of America and the hearts of southerners \ncould not be more clear on a day when the son of a single mother, mired \nin poverty, runs against the son one of the most famous Senators in the \nhistory of the country and comes out victorious.\n  I would love for us to have a conversation about what we are doing \nfor Americans as opposed to this negative, false narrative of what is \nhappening to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I have deep and tremendous respect for \nmy friend from South Carolina. I am not a Senator from the South, but \nmy family hails from the South, from Monroe, LA, to Alabama, to North \nCarolina. I know my roots, and I know the challenges of Jim Crow, and, \nthank God, we are not in a time of Jim Crow.\n  The history that my friend talked to, I know. I know his history, and \nI know my colleagues in the Senate know his history. We are all not \nblind to what happened in terms of racial oppression going back to the \nfounding of this Nation. The Constitution that people have been waving \naround, it is hard not to read that and not see that many of the \ncompromises were based upon an acquiescence to that original sin of \nthis Nation--slavery. We know the violence of what he said and talked \nabout.\n  I am frustrated that we can agree that there has been overwrought \nlanguage on both sides of the political aisle around this issue, but we \nshould be focusing on the facts. I have a hard time listening to people \nthat want to talk about this issue and don't talk about facts.\n  In the United States today, it is more difficult for the average \nAfrican American to vote than the average White American. That is not \nrhetoric. That is fact.\n  We know that Black voters, on average, are forced to wait on line \ntwice as long as White voters.\n  We began this session today swearing an oath to that flag, saying \nthat this would be a nation of liberty and justice for all. Where is \nthe justice in a nation where there is, on average, for a Black person \ntwice as long to vote? It is factual.\n  But let's keep going because I heard my colleague speak.\n  During the 2016 Presidential election, residents of entirely Black \nneighborhoods waited to vote. They were 74 percent more likely to spend \nmore than 30 minutes at their polling place relative to residents of \nentirely White neighborhoods. That is a fact.\n  Similar racial disparities were observed right before the pandemic. \nIn the 2018 midterm elections, the Brennan Center report found that \nLatino voters waited almost 46 percent longer than White voters and \nBlack voters about 45 percent.\n  The report also found that Latinos and Black voters were more likely \nthan White voters to wait in the longest of lines on election day.\n  You could go into State after State and you will see who waits, \nfactually, on longer lines.\n  Georgia--are we going to reduce this to just being about water? I \nfind that law offensive, but that is not the thing that offends me \nmost.\n  Do you want to know what is going on in Georgia right now? They have \na historical pattern of dwindling polling places in the diverse areas, \nwith some voters in Georgia waiting up to 10 hours in predominantly \nBlack neighborhoods.\n  Think about this for a second. Do you want to talk about voter \nsuppression? You are working a job, you are taking care of young kids, \nand you are going to give up a day's salary in Georgia to vote? You \nwant to talk about a modern day poll tax?\n  And my friends on the other side are saying that race is not an issue \nhere?\n  I am going to continue with facts because I was flabbergasted that \nsomeone could stand up here and say there is not a different experience \nfor Blacks and Whites when voting. I am just going to continue to read \nthe facts.\n  Since Shelby v. Holder eviscerated the Voting Rights Act that people \nlike Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner died for, Black voters in Georgia \nhave faced disproportionately longer lines and fewer polling places.\n  The average number of voters per polling place have grown 40 percent \nin diverse Atlanta Metro since 2012, and voters in Black neighborhoods \nwaited nearly 10 times as long, on average, after polling places were \nclosed in neighborhoods.\n  I am looking for an amen from my colleague from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WARNOCK. Amen.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I mean, in what country are we, where a certain minority \nin predominantly minority communities has to wait 10 times as long?\n  And so when you read--and I have heard my colleagues read these laws. \nThey read: Well, what is wrong with having no drop boxes because, hey, \nwe didn't have them before the pandemic. What is wrong with not having \nthat many days to vote by mail?\n  What is wrong with these things is obvious because they are not \ndesigned for voter protection. They are not designed to help voters \nhave more access to the polls. They are designed to suppress the vote \nand create these longer lines. That is the obvious result, and if you \ncan't see that, I am flabbergasted. I am sorry. It is hard. This is not \nmy turn to speak, and forgive me to my colleagues. But I am \nflabbergasted that the Republican Party, the party of the 14th \nAmendment, the party that once fought for equal access to the polls is \nnow creating this ruse that 19 States--that the States that are passing \nthese laws, 19 States--this is not about voter protection.\n  Donald Trump's own person said the last election was the safest, most \nsecure election in American history. This is not about in-person voter \nfraud. Study after study has shown that you are more likely to be \nstruck by lightning.\n  This is about lies. I am sorry. This is about lies, and they are \ntargeting groups.\n  I am going to go on with facts, but I just want to talk about \nstudents for a second. I heard Senator Jon Tester. I have heard my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire, and they are not hiding the ball, folks. \nThey are not trying to tell us: Oh, we are concerned about it.\n  As early as 2011, the State Republican house speaker at the time in \nNew Hampshire--Senators, you know William O'Brien; can I get a \nhallelujah there--promised to clamp down on unrestricted voting by \nstudents calling them ``kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, \nwith no life experience.''\n  I hear what you are saying, that this is--oh, these laws are \ninnocuous on their face. But if you start looking at the legislative \nrecord, you see groups are being targeted in this country. Polling \nplaces are diminishing on college campuses. Voter ID laws are being \ncreated so complex in Midwestern States that they are saying you can't \nuse a 4-year ID; it has got to be a 2-year ID. Those are some of the \nlaws that are being passed.\n  Can somebody be a witness on that?\n  And I hear this rhetoric where people pull out one law: Well, look at \nthis law. This is just about shrinking the days, or this is so \ninnocuous on its face, and I know there are people at home thinking to \nthemselves: Hey, that doesn't sound like a big deal. Maybe the \nRepublicans have a point.\n  No. Let's return to the facts.\n  I am going to go to Texas because I heard the Senator from Texas \naccuse this body of creating rhetoric that was divisive.\n  Do you want to know what is divisive to a country that says ``e \npluribus unum'' above where the presiding person is? Do you want to \nknow what is divisive? It is telling people in the Congresswoman's \nState that if you live in a predominantly minority area, we are going \nto remove polling places and change laws so that Black folks \ndisproportionately are waiting 5, 10, 15 times longer.\n  Facts. The burden of long lines in polling places, closures in Texas \nin the post-Shelby County areas often falls disproportionately on Black \nand Latino voters.\n  Congresswoman, of the approximately 750 sites Texas has closed since \nShelby v. Holder, 542 were in the 50 counties with the fastest growing \nBlack and Latino populations.\n  Don't lecture me about Jim Crow. I know this is not 1965. That is \nwhat makes me so outraged. It is 2022, and they are blatantly removing \nmore polling places from the counties where Blacks and Latinos are \noverrepresented. I am not making that up; that is a fact.\n  I am not going to stop because I am tired of hearing that this does \nnot have to do with singling out certain populations in our country--\nstudents, Native Americans--and not others.\n  I am not accusing anybody. Please, let's not go around in defense, \nwhere we crouch into defensive postures. I am not accusing anybody of \nbeing racist. I am just speaking to the facts in our country that I \nknow motivate everybody here. A hundred of my--ninety-nine of my \ncolleagues know it is wrong to create barriers for some populations and \nnot others under the guise of a lie that there is a voter security \nproblem.\n  Let me continue. I am sorry, Congresswoman, to keep talking about \nTexas.\n  In the Presidential primary on March 3, voters at historically Black \nTexas Southern University in Houston waited not an hour, not 2 hours, \nnot 3, 4, 5--waited 6 hours.\n  A poll of Texas voters conducted just in the 2020 election \nunderscored the disparity non-White voters faced in casting their \nballots.\n  I am sorry. Senator Kaine, you were very good when you talked about \nthat sign of 98 percent of people happy. I sat here stunned. I was \nwondering who they were polling because they were not polling Black and \nLatino voters in Texas when they did that.\n  Let me give you the facts. Forty-eight percent of Black voters and 55 \npercent of Latino voters in Texas found it easy to vote, but that \nleaves a lot of folks who didn't think it was easy. White voters--\nactually, 65 percent think it is easy to vote.\n  Everybody is not happy. People who wait in 6-hour lines are not \nhappy.\n  I just want to give a couple more facts. Let's go to my dad's home \nState. North Carolina was one of the States most affected by poll \nclosures. There were 158 fewer polling places in 40 counties with large \nBlack communities, and African-American voter participation dropped 16 \npercent. Why? Well, my friend Bennet said this. We still live in a \ncountry where the economic disparities between Blacks and Whites is \nwhat it was in the 1960s. So if you are a Black, struggling family, and \nyour option to vote means standing in line for 10 hours--compared to \npredominantly White counties--where the wait is longer, you don't go \nvote.\n  That is not just Black folks. The stories about disabled voters, with \nabout 1 in 7 or 1 in 8 pointing out that it is hard for them to vote \nbecause of physical impediments--that is discriminatory against them. \nIt doesn't mean people here are anti-disabled. We are not throwing \nthose labels around; I am just talking about the facts.\n  So I just want my colleagues to know that I can pull story after \nstory of these States--the 19 that are passing these laws--if you pull \nthem out and want to read them absent context, you are going to try to \nobscure the larger picture of what is going on in our Nation, which is \nthat we are seeing entirely Republican legislatures--entirely \nRepublican legislators--passing laws that are disproportionately \nimpacting certain groups, by the facts.\n  I want to close with this: On the march across the Edmund Pettus \nBridge, they were stopped and beaten back. They tried to go again with \nKing and were again blocked by Alabama State troopers. But they finally \ngot to their destination to protest voting rights.\n  I love what King said there. He talked about those people whose \nhearts were discouraged because they hadn't passed voting rights. I \nknow there are going to be a lot of people here on this day who are \ngoing to feel that kind of discouragement. But, Reverend Warnock, King \ngave one of his best speeches that day where he asked people ``How long \nare we going to have to wait? Not long'' because the truth--I am \nthinking about the lies we are hearing now, the big lies, the lies of \nin-person voting. The truth, crushed to the Earth, will rise again.\n\n  Don't lie and say there is not a disparate voting reality for Blacks \nand Whites in this country right now; the facts speak differently. \nDon't lie and say that these laws are not being done in a way to make \nit harder for students to vote. Don't lie and say that we are a nation \nthat should be doing more to ease access as opposed to putting up more \nbarriers because to go on more barriers is anti-democratic. Those lies \nwill not live forever.\n  I do believe still that the arc of the moral universe is long and it \nbends toward justice. I still believe that the best of our democracy \nwill come out if people do not give up and are not discouraged.\n  I ask my colleagues right now to continue on the floor today, to \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\ntell the truth of what is happening in your States, to continue telling \nthe truth of what is happening in our Nation, because we will win this \nfight. I don't know how long it will take, but that will be determined \nby how dedicated we are to the principles of this democracy.\n  We must live in a nation where everyone is equal--not in rhetoric or \nin slogans or in salutes, but everyone is equal in the experience they \nhave to participate in democracy. The vote is the bedrock of our \nNation. It is the foundation of the country, and it does have cracks \nthat need our repair.\n  Whether we get down on our knees in prayer or we stand tall, let's \ncontinue the work of this democracy so that freedom and justice do roll \ndown like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n  Forgive me, colleagues, for speaking well beyond my time, and I \napologize if I demonstrated too much emotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, confidence in our elections is vital to \nself-governance, and voting is a fundamental right. This is something \nthat Democrats and Republicans can agree on.\n  Article I, section 4 of the Constitution states that ``Times, Places \nand Manner'' of congressional elections ``shall be prescribed by the \nStates.''\n  Over the last year, my Democratic colleagues have introduced and \ntried to pass several versions of what they call voting rights \nlegislation--the For the People Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. But \nthese wholesome titles are seriously misleading. The bills are partisan \npower grabs that will give the Federal Government unprecedented power \nover our elections and weaken the ability of State legislatures to \nadminister their own election laws.\n  Federalizing election procedures would export traditional State \nauthority to the Federal Government and defer decisions on how citizens \nelect their congressional representatives to Congress. This is \ninherently less responsive and less accountable.\n\n  This legislation would undermine State legislatures by sending \ntaxpayer dollars to political candidates for the House of \nRepresentatives, weaken popular State voter ID laws, and make updating \nrolls more difficult.\n  According to a Gallup poll, 80 percent of Americans support voter ID \nlaws. Yet, under this legislation, States would be required to accept \nessentially any document that includes a person's name as a valid form \nof ID. If you wanted to dispel the notion that voter fraud occurs in \nour elections, this is not a good start.\n  One-size-fits-all solutions--the approach the Democrats are pushing--\nis completely unfit for Kansas and for the country.\n  Perhaps even more alarming--and this is the point that I would make \nmore strongly than what I just said--more alarming than this Federal \nelection takeover is the Democrats' proposed means of passing it.\n  President Biden and Majority Leader Schumer, realizing the \nlimitations of their slimmest possible majority in the Senate, have \nadvocated for weakening the legislative filibuster, the ability for the \nSenate to debate legislation until a 60-vote threshold is met.\n  Ironically, Democrats utilized the filibuster vote margin just last \nweek to block sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, making use \nof the same 60-vote threshold they are so determined to demonize.\n  The filibuster protects the minority. It doesn't necessarily mean \nRepublicans or Democrats. It may mean just somebody with an odd idea. \nIt may mean rural, where I come from, or urban, where other Members of \nthe Senate come from. It may mean the ability for a Member of the \nSenate to speak on behalf of his or her constituents and advocate for \ntheir views. It allows every Senator to have the opportunity to garner \nmore information, to seek out sponsors of a bill, to have \nconversations, and to pull people together before we decide on how to \nproceed on legislation. But the filibuster does more than that. It \nforces us--I am sorry it is necessary to force us, but it forces us to \nwork together.\n  Freedoms and liberties are protected by process. In today's world, \ntoo many people want the outcome regardless of how the process works. \nThat process is called the Constitution of the United States. And in \nour case, there are rules in the U.S. Senate that require a 60-vote for \nlegislation to be considered and passed by the U.S. Senate.\n  In the circumstances that those are eroded, those process issues--I \nreally want to highlight it again. It bothers me so much that in so \nmany circumstances, we set aside process because we want an end result. \nBut in doing so, we erode the personal freedoms of Kansans and all \nAmericans, and those freedoms and liberties are diminished as a result.\n  I would say it is unusual for me to have as many of my colleagues on \nthe floor as there are today while I speak, and in this case, most are \nDemocrats. I would say that if we want to change the U.S. Senate--and I \nam a critic of the way we do business here. I never enjoyed serving in \nthe U.S. Senate in which it worked well.\n  If we wanted to do something that would actually make a difference as \nopposed to changing the process by which we consider legislation, how \nabout having committees that actually do their work; how about having \nhearings and markups and debate? Give me the chance--give all of my \ncolleagues a chance to participate in this democracy of developing \nlegislation.\n  But how many times have I voted on things that are garnered, put \ntogether, patchworked together, created by the leadership of the Senate \nor the leadership of the House or working together, a bill that is \nproposed by the White House? I want to have ownership. Even if I don't \nget my way, at least I had the opportunity, and it is the committee \nprocess that allows us to do that.\n  Instead of fixing something as fundamental as the Congress of the \nUnited States and having committees at work, we are going to change the \nprocess by which we can get to a bill or pass a bill and reduce the \nrole that people who have different ideas play in that outcome.\n  Give me ownership of legislation through a committee process. Don't \ntake away my ability to better represent Kansans and Americans and \npeople in the minority by changing the 60-vote rule.\n  Americans voted for a Congress that is nearly a 50-50 split between \nthe parties in the House and a precisely 50-50 split in the Senate. I \ndon't think Americans voted to give one party free rein to implement an \nunprecedented power grab to nationalize elections and fundamentally \nreshape the way the Senate passes legislation.\n  Thankfully, there is bipartisan opposition to weakening the \nfilibuster. A majority of Senators agree it would bring about massive \nuncertainty for Americans who don't want to be subjected to the \ndramatic political swings when one election occurs and one party is in \npower and then the next party is in power.\n  There is so much uncertainty because there was never the consensus to \nbuild a 60-vote margin for a piece of legislation.\n  We must have confidence in our elections. It matters. I want everyone \nwho is legally entitled to vote to be able to vote. I understand that \nvoting is a fundamental right, but Kansans know what is best for \nKansans, and congressional Democrats would be wise not to underestimate \nour resolve in making our own determinations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I thank the Presiding Officer for covering the presiding \nChair for a little longer than usual to allow me to make an address to \nthe Senate.\n  Madam President, I rise because it is time for the Senate to stand on \nthe side of protecting our very democracy and the freedom to vote.\n  You know, this used to be a bipartisan issue, and I was proud to \nknow, in the history of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it passed the \nSenate 77 to 19. Then, in 1982, when it was reauthorized, when we \nextended it, President Reagan said:\n\n       I've pledged that, as long as I'm in a position to uphold \n     the Constitution, no barrier will come between our citizens \n     and the voting booth. And this bill is a vital part of \n     fulfilling that pledge.\n\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, the dean of the \nWisconsin delegation, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican, \nled the bipartisan effort for the Voting Rights Act\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nReauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. You know, today, we can't \neven get a vote in the Senate on the Voting Rights Act.\n  Why have today's Republicans walked so far from those who came before \nthem?\n  There is a simple answer: Too many of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle refuse to stand up for democracy and, instead, choose to \nstand on the side of Donald Trump and his Big Lie about the 2020 \nelection being stolen from him.\n  It wasn't. Trump lost fair and square, and President Biden won, and \nthat is simply a fact. To suggest otherwise is a fraud that undermines \npeople's faith in our very elections. Enough is enough. We must act. We \nhave the responsibility to do so. The threat posed by this Big Lie is \nall too real, and in my home State of Wisconsin, we have a stark \nexample of it.\n  I come from a purple swing State. We have had many, many closely \ndecided elections in recent history. In 2000, then-Vice President Gore \nwon the State by less than 6,000 votes--a mere .22-percent margin of \nvictory. Four years later, John Kerry carried the State by about 11,000 \nvotes--a .38-percent margin. In both cases, despite these narrow \nmargins, those elections went smoothly and were fair. Their outcomes \nwere not disputed. George W. Bush declined to request a recount. No \ncredible person, let alone the leader of a political party or an \nelected official, claimed the election in Wisconsin wasn't fair, free, \nand properly decided by the voters. Once again, in 2016, we had a \npretty close Presidential election in Wisconsin and another equally as \nclose one in 2020. President Biden won Wisconsin by about 20,000 \nvotes--a margin of victory of .63 percent.\n  In 2020, Wisconsinites exercised their right to vote in record \nnumbers. More than 75 percent of eligible Wisconsinites voted. \nWisconsin voters broke the record for the highest turnout ever measured \nin the State--with every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties producing an \nincrease in turnout, benefiting both Presidential candidates. Wisconsin \nState and local officials and citizens who volunteered from both \npolitical parties did heroic work to ensure our election was smooth, \nsafe, and fair. They took important steps to make our election system \nworked safely and securely for all voters while the COVID-19 pandemic \nraged in my home State.\n  Wisconsinites cast their ballots for Democrats and Republicans, up \nand down the ballot, and after Wisconsin county clerks in all 72 \ncounties canvassed the results, Joe Biden won with a margin of over \n20,000 votes. The voters of Wisconsin chose Joe Biden and Kamala Harris \nto receive our State's 10 certified electoral votes, but the scrutiny \nof those election results, through the channels provided by law, \ncontinue.\n  After an official vote count showed Trump lost, his campaign \nrequested a recount and targeted Wisconsin's two most diverse \ncounties--Milwaukee and Dane. When the recount was completed, it came \nto nobody's surprise that it didn't change the outcome. Trump lost, and \nPresident Biden won. The votes had been counted and recounted, but that \ndid not stop President Trump from filing a lawsuit, trying to throw out \n220,000 legal votes in Wisconsin.\n  Fortunately, our State's highest court rejected this attempt to \ndisenfranchise Wisconsin voters and find more votes for himself. As two \nWisconsin Supreme Court justices wrote, in concurring with the majority \ndecision of dismissing Trump's campaign case, ``The evidence does show \nthat, despite a global pandemic, more than 3.2 million Wisconsinites \nperformed their civic duty. More importantly, as it relates to this \nlawsuit, these voters followed the rules that were in place at the \ntime.''\n  To borrow Justice Hagedorn's metaphor, ``Wisconsin voters complied \nwith the election rule book. No penalties were committed, and the final \nscore was the result of a free and fair election.''\n  But that wasn't the end of the road for Republican efforts to sow \ndistrust in the 2020 results in Wisconsin.\n\n  In February 2021, a committee of the Republican-controlled Wisconsin \nState legislature, by a party-line vote, directed the nonpartisan \nLegislative Audit Bureau to review the administration of the 2020 \nelection. The bureau, according to its report, spoke with the staff of \nthe bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and surveyed all 1,835 \nmunicipal clerks and 72 county clerks in the State. They also reviewed \na host of records regarding the election, including a total of 45 sworn \ncomplaints, pertaining to the election, that had been filed with the \nelections commission. In October, the bureau issued its report, which \ndid not find any evidence of widespread voter fraud or wrongdoing in \nthe election.\n  Separately, a conservative think tank, the Wisconsin Institute for \nLaw and Liberty, conducted its own review of the election. Their \nreport, released in December 2021, also concluded that there was no \nevidence of widespread voter fraud in Wisconsin.\n  The fact is that our bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission \nconducted a free, fair, safe, and secure election, just as local \nelections clerks did across our State.\n  Trump has still not provided any credible evidence of voter fraud or \nelection irregularities. In fact, Federal judges appointed by Trump \nrejected on the merits his false claims about the Wisconsin election. \nDespite all of this, the Republican leadership of the Wisconsin \nlegislature authorized yet another sham process to question the \nintegrity of the 2020 election, with a budget of at least 680,000 of \nWisconsin taxpayer dollars to boot.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this unnecessary \npartisan charade came shortly after the former President called out \nthese Republican leaders by name for trying to prevent a forensic audit \nof the election results. This was no mere coincidence. A Wisconsin \nState Republican named Michael Gableman led this effort after he \nfamously said--and without evidence--right after the November election, \nthat it was somehow stolen. He is who is leading this probe.\n  In August, Gableman traveled to Arizona, on Wisconsin taxpayers' \ndime, to learn about that State's widely discredited audit, supported \nby the cyber ninjas.\n  Then he was off to South Dakota to attend a symposium on voter fraud, \nled by My Pillow's chief executive and infamous conspiracy theorist, \nMike Lindell. In no effort to show nonpartisanship or to be a neutral \narbiter, Gableman hired partisan actors like a former Trump \nadministration official and the head of a group that asked the Supreme \nCourt to throw out the results of Wisconsin's election and force the \nWisconsin legislature to certify electors instead.\n  Gableman has issued wide-ranging subpoenas to local officials in \nWisconsin's largest cities and has even threatened to jail them if they \nfail to comply with this taxpayer-funded promotion of Trump's Big Lie.\n  Separately, the Republican leader of the Wisconsin Assembly's \nelections committee began her own set of investigations, issuing \nsubpoenas to clerks in Milwaukee and Brown Counties, the latter being \nhome to Green Bay. She had also traveled to Arizona and, in a press \nrelease, when announcing her inquiries, stated that Wisconsin similarly \nneeds a ``transparent, full, cyber-forensic audit.''\n  To put it simply, there has been a constant drumbeat undermining the \nintegrity of our elections in Wisconsin since President Biden was duly \nelected. Casting doubt and undermining confidence in our elections has \nreal consequences. It has led to harassment and threats of the hard-\nworking State and local elections officials who worked tirelessly \nduring an unprecedented public health crisis to make sure Wisconsinites \ncould safely and securely exercise their right to vote. Elections \nofficials across the State have received dangerous threats and \nharassment for simply doing their jobs.\n  The executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission reported \nbeing told she deserved to be hung in the public square. She received a \nthreatening letter at her home, calling her a traitor and a profane \ninsult that I will not repeat on the floor of the Senate. She also \nreceived a profanity-laced voice mail, telling her she should be \nconvicted and hanged.\n  Another Wisconsin clerk reported being called every name you can \nimagine and received threats that led to a local police department's \nhaving to conduct a security review of the clerk's office and having \nthe clerk feeling the\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nneed to install a camera at her house for security.\n  In Rock County, WI, the county clerk's office asked the local sheriff \nfor protection in the wake of angry calls after a news report had \nmisstated the county's votes. One of the members of the Wisconsin \nElections Commission had pictures of her home posted on social media, \nand she received threatening messages about her children.\n  Even elected officials are attacking the role of these individuals in \nadministering our elections. A Republican sheriff has called for the \nfive members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to face \ncriminal charges for guidance they provided during the pandemic about \ncollecting absentee ballots from nursing homes.\n  Let's be clear. On January 6, 2021, Donald Trump not only incited a \nviolent insurrection against our democracy, he also incited an ongoing \nattack on voting rights across America. Across the country, we have \nseen more than 400 bills that restrict access to voting that have been \nintroduced in 49 States.\n  In Wisconsin, the Republican-controlled State legislature has \nadvanced legislation curtailing voting rights and has put up barriers \nto make it harder to vote. Last year, they passed measures that would \nmake it harder for voters to turn in their absentee ballots. They have \npassed legislation that threaten election officials with felonies for \nassisting voters with minor issues on their ballots, and they want to \nmake it harder for people with disabilities and who cannot make it into \nthe polls to exercise their right to vote. Thankfully, our Wisconsin \nGovernor has vetoed these measures.\n  Despite drop boxes being a safe, secure, and effective way for voters \nto turn in their ballots and have their votes counted and despite \nprevious support for their use from Republicans in the State \nlegislature, Trump's Big Lie has pushed them to now oppose the use of \ndrop boxes statewide. In fact, there is now a push to override guidance \nfrom the Wisconsin Elections Commission to make drop boxes for legal \nballots illegal in Wisconsin.\n\n  At the same time, the Republicans in the State legislature are \nadvancing a redistricting proposal that will double down on Wisconsin's \nunprecedented level of hyperpartisan gerrymandering, where politicians \npick their voters instead of people choosing their elected officials.\n  Not to be outdone, the New York Times has reported that my fellow \nSenator from Wisconsin--and this is a quote--``believes Democrats \ncheat.''\n  This false accusation was accompanied by a proposal from this U.S. \nSenator to change the rules in Wisconsin and have the Republican-\ncontrolled State legislature seize control over the administration of \nour elections, taking this nonpartisan process out of the hands of our \nbipartisan, independent Wisconsin State Elections Commission.\n  As was reported, ``Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said that \nG.O.P. state lawmakers should unilaterally assert control [over] \nfederal elections, claiming that they had the authority to do so even \nif Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, stood in their way--an extraordinary \nlegal argument debunked by a 1932 Supreme Court decision and a 1964 \nruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court.''\n  That is from the New York Times.\n  For my part, I believe voting rights are fundamental to our \ndemocracy, and that is why I will keep on working to pass the John \nLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, so we \nstop voter suppression efforts and protect the right to vote. We must \nensure that, regardless of where you live in this country, you have the \nsame access to the ballot box and faith that our elections are fair and \nsafe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, my Democratic colleagues are \ncontinuing what started last week, with spending hours trying to \nconvince Members of their own party, both here in this Chamber and \nacross the country, that they had no choice but to blow up the Senate \nrules by firing a partisan torpedo at the filibuster.\n  Now, it appears, from what we have heard, that they used demeaning, \nshaming words and really went about weaving quite a frightening tale \nabout what would happen if their Democratic colleagues did not cave on \nthis issue. That tale was no more based in reality than the vial \naccusations of racism that they have hurled at those who oppose this \npush to single-party rule.\n  Last week, when this insulting narrative started to collapse, they \ntried a new approach and pitched their assault on the Senate as a \n``carve-out'' to accommodate an emergency change to election law.\n  I fully believe, when someone is going to tell you who they are, you \nshould believe them. And over the past year, we have watched Joe Biden \nand the Democrats throw self-control out the window and leverage \nemergency after emergency to expand their power.\n  Joe Biden signed more than a dozen Executive orders in the very first \nhours of his Presidency, knowing that if he did not do this, these \npolicies would never see the light of day.\n  The people--and that is the people of this country--hadn't seen fit \nto give his allies in Congress the majority that he needed for his \nagenda, so he waved his pen and conjured up a mandate for himself.\n  And now, his Democratic allies in the Senate are prepared to do the \nexact same thing on behalf of a bill that would federalize elections in \nAmerica, stripping away protections for the ballot box and injecting \nuncertainty into the voting process.\n  Who asked for this? No one. If the American people wanted this, they \nwould have given the Democrats the majority they needed to get it done. \nBut they didn't. And, in fact, I hear from Tennesseans every day who \nwant it to be easier to vote and harder to cheat, not the other way \naround.\n\n  But based on what I have seen, I have come to the conclusion that \nwhat the people want no longer seems to matter to our Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  We can take today's event as proof that if the people don't see fit \nto give them the power, they will come and take that power and turn the \nSenate into a rubberstamp they can deploy when an Executive order just \nwon't get the job done.\n  That really frightens Tennesseans because they can see what is coming \ndown the path: open borders, court packing, gun control, the Green New \nDeal, abortion on demand, socialized healthcare, speech restrictions, \nfederalized elections, and more out-of-control spending, and, yes, \nhigher inflation.\n  We know that this is the future that the Democrats are laying out for \nAmerica. It is the future that they see for our children and \ngrandchildren because these policies are the policies that they have \nfought for since long before Joe Biden took office.\n  Do we really think that this attack on the Senate rules will stop \nwith an election law takeover? The American people don't think it will. \nTennesseans do not think that it will.\n  As I said, when somebody shows you who they really are, you ought to \nbelieve them. And as I have said previously, this is no way to run the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, but this is exactly how the \nDemocrats are choosing to go about trying to destroy it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The junior Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, why are we here? Why is this Senate \ndedicating this entire day to a debate on the floor?\n  Well, we are here today to talk about, to debate and consider two \ncritical voting rights bills. It is our fourth try. It is our fourth \ntry. The three previous times we have tried to get on this bill, there \nhas been a filibuster on the motion to proceed, an obscure a procedural \nstanding that prevented us from getting to this bill.\n  We are finally on it, and there is a challenge in this Chamber, in \nthis country, to explain and articulate briefly why this is such an \nimportant moment and why it justifies, in a tension between two of my \ncore principles--one of which is making sure that we work across the \naisle and find bipartisan solutions as much as possible and the other \nthat we protect foundational principles--the right to vote--and through \nthat right to make progress toward justice and inclusion in our \nsociety--that I choose the latter.\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\n  We have seen across our country, in recent months and years--ever \nsince Shelby County, a Supreme Court case, blew a hole in the center of \nthe Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, the most powerful civil rights \nlaw in the history our country--a whole series of laws at the State and \nlocal level eroding and undermining access to the ballot.\n  And in the months since the 2020 election, tragically, we have also \nseen now State legislatures take up and pass laws designed to change \nwho counts the ballot, who certifies an election, voter subversion and \nvoter subversion, access to the ballot box, and who counts the votes.\n  Every one of us is here because we were elected. Every one of us \nwants to know, or should want to know, that we won a free and fair \nelection in which as many Americans in our State as possible voted.\n  Why would we want barriers to Americans with disabilities, Americans \nspeaking different languages, Americans working full time and strained \nby their working family commitments, Americans who are Black or Brown, \nNative American, or Hispanic, or African American? Why would we want to \nhave any suspicion that our election to this body relied, in some part, \non suppressing or miscounting those votes?\n  Today, I am going to speak just briefly, if I can, about how today is \nreally about a fraying bipartisan consensus. Some of my Republican \nfriends and colleagues have spoken about how we have to continue to \nhang on to and respect the rules of this Senate, especially the 60-vote \nthreshold, to moving forward on policy changes, and I have long \ndefended that and respect that concern. But we are also principally \nhere because of a forgotten consensus about working together to protect \naccess to the ballot box.\n  We have heard just now from a colleague the accusation that this is a \n``partisan Federal takeover'' of elections. Yet several of my \ncolleagues have read and reminded us the Constitution itself explicitly \ngives this Congress the power, even the responsibility, to ensure that \nFederal elections are conducted in a way that is free and fair.\n  When the first Senate gathered, think about who was in the room. \nThink about the qualifications to vote, how narrow they were--property, \nWhite men. Think about the arc of change in our Nation and how, year \nafter year, generation after generation, with a huge amount of \nstruggle, ultimately, the moral question of who can vote, of who counts \nand whose vote should be counted has slowly, painfully, through \nsacrifice, changed.\n  There was, for 50 years--from 1965, when earned through blood and \nsacrifice on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the Voting Rights Act was signed \ninto law by a former Senator from Texas, President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson--there was for 50 years a consensus in this body that the \nVoting Rights Act was a critical, even a sacrosanct, protection. It was \nreauthorized five times--in 1970, in 1975, in 1982, and in 1992--by \nstrong bipartisan majorities, and in 2006, unanimously. No wonder, \nthen, that my friend and predecessor at this desk, our President, seems \nto struggle to comprehend how a Republican Party that included Strom \nThurmond, when he chaired the Judiciary Committee, voted over and over \nand over to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  Yet today, as we debate the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, \nwe sadly do not have a single vote across this aisle to move us \nforward.\n  How did this happen? How did this consensus, so hard-won, fray so \nquickly? In short, it is because of a lie. It is because of a \nmisrepresentation that millions of illegals are voting--famously said \nby our immediate past President. But a widespread belief that voter \nfraud was undermining the very credibility of our elections has been \nadopted across our country and spread and caused a fundamental break.\n  There has also been action by the new conservative majority on the \nSupreme Court; first, in 2013 in Shelby County, where they took out the \nsection 4(b) formula that eviscerated section 5 preclearance to provide \nfree election protection against voter suppression; and then just last \nyear, in Brnovich v. DNC, when six conservative Justices concluded that \na State law in Arizona that had a demonstrable disparate impact on \nHispanic and Native American and Black voters could be allowed to stay \non the books and proceed.\n  Now, let's be clear. We should make sure there is no widespread voter \nfraud. And on the Judiciary Committee, my colleague from Illinois and \nothers have led hearings to confirm that there is no widespread voter \nfraud, as my colleague from California, the former secretary of state, \nspoke eloquently to earlier.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act, which is the other bill in front of us, \nbenefited from modifications by Senator Manchin of West Virginia, also \na former secretary of state, to ensure that we have protections in \nterms of voter ID.\n  I will also, briefly--and I know I need to conclude--respond, if I \ncan, to accusations by several of my colleagues that Delaware's voting \nlaws are not yet at the highest standard. And I will say, it is true my \nState has a long, brutal, tragic history of race relations that were \nnot their best, and our voting laws have just now come to up to the \nFederal standards we are hoping to make the standard for our whole \ncountry.\n  But let me ask this question: In the midst of a pandemic, when State \nafter State has adopted changes to voting ballot boxes and no-fault \nvote-by-mail and same-day registration, why would States be moving \nthose back? The pandemic isn't over.\n\n  In November, millions of medically vulnerable Americans will be \nlooking to vote. Why would we end these new provisions to provide \naccess to the ballot box?\n  Let me make two last points and conclude.\n  As I have traveled to a dozen countries in the last year, I have \nheard from allies and adversaries concerns about the health of our \ndemocracy. We must take action to protect the right to vote in this \ncountry.\n  Last, we should not make the last casualty of this dread pandemic \nrolling back voting access. If I must choose between a fundamental \nprinciple learned through five congressional civil rights pilgrimages \nspent with John Lewis that voting is a moral question or continue to \nhold to a rule, I will choose the former and embrace a change that is \nas narrow and temporary as possible and that will restore debate on \nthis floor.\n  As I marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time with \nJohn Lewis, he stopped and turned and said to all of us in his halting \nvoice, knowing he was in his last weeks: Never give in. Never give up. \nNever become hostile. Hate is too great a burden to bear. Stay hopeful \nand keep marching.\n  It is my hope, Madam President, that our debate today, our votes \ntoday, will give strength and lift and truth to the service and the \nlife and the sacrifice of Congressman Lewis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            Democratic Party\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I \noften speak about my family here on the Senate floor. As most of my \ncolleagues know, I grew up poor and spent years of my childhood living \nin public housing. I never knew my biological dad, and my mom and my \nadopted father did the best they could for our family with the very \nlittle they had.\n  I think that small part of my life is well known, but what may not be \nknown to many people is that my parents were Democrats. Sadly, the \nDemocratic Party my parents belonged to no longer exists. Today's \nDemocratic Party would be totally unrecognizable to my parents, just as \nit is to millions of Americans all across our country right now.\n  I am a proud Republican. It is no secret that I am trying to expand \nmy party, but I still believe in the benefits of our centuries-old two-\nparty system. It makes our Nation stronger; it pushes us to listen to \nboth sides, work together, and leads to progress.\n  That is why the filibuster is so important. As a rule, the filibuster \nembodies what is most essential to the survival of our Republic. It \nweakens the sometimes attractive nature of tribalism and bolsters the \nimportance of and need for consensus when crafting policy.\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\n  The filibuster protects our democratic process. That is why the \nFounders designed the Senate to operate this way, as a cooling saucer \nthat could resist the temptation of political expediency that leads our \ncountry to wild swings in policy and position.\n  I make this point not only to highlight the foolishness of doing away \nwith this rule as my Democratic colleagues would like to do but to draw \nattention to the gravely concerning abandonment of democratic \nprinciples we see in today's Democratic Party.\n  Madam President, I take no joy in saying this, but today's Democratic \nParty has become the new anti-democracy party. The terrifying examples \nof this are all around us: packing the Supreme Court, pushing a radical \nFederal takeover of State elections, ignoring our laws on border \nenforcement and criminal prosecution, and forcing unconstitutional \nvaccine mandates on American workers. None of these things give more \npower to the people we are elected to represent.\n\n  What these dangerous ideas show is that today's Democrats don't \nbelieve that people are capable of getting it right. Democrats don't \nthink their ideas can win enough elections to control a majority in the \nSenate. Senator Schumer said as much just last week. He said that if \nthe Democrats don't pass their ``Corrupt Politicians Act,'' they will \nlose their majority. A party that once prided itself on being a voice \nfor working Americans like my parents is now turning to authoritarian \ntactics to impose its will on government by force because it does not \ntrust the decision voters will make.\n  In trying to pack the Supreme Court, Democrats are saying they do not \ntrust the decisions of the State legislatures--bodies comprised of the \npeople's elected representatives.\n  In pushing the Federal takeover of State elections, Democrats are \nshowing that they know their ideas are too radical to win the approval \nof voters, so they need to leave the backdoor open for fraud and the \ndilution of votes to win elections and stay in power. That is why they \nwant to give noncitizens--those here illegally and who may be dangerous \ncriminals--the sacred right to vote.\n  In pushing an unconstitutional vaccine mandate, Democrats are making \nclear that they don't trust the American people to make smart decisions \nfor themselves and their families when it comes to their own health.\n  In the eyes of today's Democrat leaders, disagreement is intolerable. \nThere are no more opponents; only racists. They allow no room for \ncompromise because all who disagree are evil, bigoted, and backward.\n  When the ruling class strips the people of their voice, democracy \ndies. When the elites in Washington decide they know better than the \nfamilies they are supposed to represent, our American experiment fails.\n  Madam President, it is a sad day when I think about how \nunrecognizable today's Democratic Party would be to my parents, not \nbecause it has naturally evolved or modernized but because it has \nabandoned the principles it once fought so hard to protect.\n  I am sure these words will upset many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I hope they do, and I hope it drives them to refocus \ntheir party back where it belongs: on the needs of American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am not sure where to start, having \njust heard my colleague from Florida. I just have to say that who he is \ndescribing I don't recognize, either, because I don't recognize that at \nall of anyone who is here.\n  I just want to start by thanking my Democratic colleagues, first of \nall, for voting for the American Recovery Act that, among many other \nthings, is helping to focus on ways to bring down the cost of food and \nour food supply chain, to help fix it, and a number of other issues \nthat unfortunately not one colleague on the Republican side voted for--\nnot one.\n  So we have heard a lot today about how we should be focusing on the \nneeds of the American people. I think there would be a collective \n``amen'' from our side about that. We would love to have our colleagues \njoin us, frankly, in that effort. But nothing is more fundamental to \nour democracy than preserving our freedom to vote as Americans, and \nthat is really what the debate and the votes are all about today.\n\n  We know there are people willing to use violence to stop accurate, \nlegal certifications of our national Presidential election. How do we \nknow this? Because we were here. We were here a year ago on January 6 \nand witnessed the violence and the death and the destruction.\n  We also know there is a coordinated Republican effort across the \ncountry to limit the freedom to vote and make it easier to intimidate \nand remove election officials who won't do their bidding. And how do I \nknow this? Because it is happening in Michigan as I speak.\n  Today's vote on the legislation in front of us is the fundamental act \nwe must do to stop this destructive, partisan movement, and we also \nknow that in order to make this happen, we have to return the Senate to \nits original principle--the original principle of majority vote.\n  Our Nation's Founders had a lot of opinions about the type of country \nwe should be and the type of government we should have. At times, the \ndiscussions got heated--and not just because it was summer in \nPhiladelphia, Senator Casey. They were actually wearing wool at the \ntime, so it got heated in a number of different ways. However, there \nwas one thing they agreed on: Government should be run by the will of \nthe majority--not a minority, not a King. They agreed on this because \nthey saw what happened when a nation is held captive to the views of \nthe minority.\n  The very first Constitution of the United States, the Articles of \nConfederation, was, frankly, a dysfunctional mess. That is why they \ngathered in Philadelphia to try again and to get it right this time, \nand getting it right meant majority rule.\n  James Madison said that majority rule is fundamental to our \ndemocracy. Thomas Jefferson said that ``the will of the majority is in \nall cases to prevail.'' In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton wrote a \nlengthy description of the problems that arise when a minority can \noverride the will of the majority.\n  The Founders didn't have an opinion on the Senate filibuster because \nit didn't exist. It didn't exist. However, over time, Senators figured \nout they could slow down legislation through unlimited debate.\n  We know that, at first, the filibuster was rarely used--mainly by \nsouthern Senators who wanted to block civil rights legislation. Yet, \nover time, it has evolved from a procedural tool into a weapon, and we \nall know this. This weapon is increasingly used to stop our Nation from \nmaking progress on issues that are so important to the American people \nand so important to our families and crucial to the future of our \ncountry.\n  We are here today because the most basic freedom in our democracy is \nthe freedom to vote, and across the Nation, Republicans are pushing \nlegislation to take that away, including in Michigan.\n  In 2020, Michigan voters clearly and resoundingly chose Joe Biden to \nbe our President and Kamala Harris to be our Vice President in the \nlargest voter turnout in our Nation's history. They won by more than \n150,000 votes, and that is 14 times more than Donald Trump's margin was \nin 2016.\n  Now, I very much appreciate my friend Senator Thune saying he \naccepted his first loss to the Senate. None of us like to lose. It is \nnot fun. President Trump should have done the same thing, but instead, \nDonald Trump's campaign and his allies filed eight lawsuits in \nMichigan. They lost every single one of them. In the only case that was \nappealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, the court declined to hear the \ncase despite having a majority of Republican justices.\n  The people of Michigan voted. Michigan Republican and Democratic \ncounties verified the vote, and our State, on a bipartisan vote, \ncertified it. There is no evidence of fraud that would suggest we need \nlegislation to now restrict our voting.\n  So why are Michigan Republicans trying to make it harder to vote with \n39 different bills they have introduced? Well, they just don't like who \nMichiganders voted for. Think about it. Because they didn't like the \nresult,\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nMichigan Republicans decided to target Michigan voters as part of a \ncoordinated, nationwide assault on this fundamental right that my \nfriend, the late Congressman John Lewis, called precious, almost \nsacred.\n  That is why we must pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act \ntoday. I know that some folks think any legislation we pass to protect \nthe freedom to vote must be bipartisan to be legitimate. But when it is \ntime to vote, we are told not 1 Republican will join all 50 Democrats--\n50 Democrats--in voting for the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act; \ntherefore, they say, the bill shouldn't pass. Yet the attacks on \ndemocracy in Michigan and the other States are strictly partisan.\n  In Michigan, Republicans are even using a loophole in our \nconstitution to go around the Governor's veto and take away people's \nfreedom to vote without the capacity to veto the legislation. They are \ndoing it by a simple majority, and they are doing it with not one \nDemocratic vote--not one--in Michigan. But they are still doing it.\n  Republicans are making it harder for people to vote using a simple \nmajority. Yet we are told that protecting people's freedom to vote \nneeds a supermajority to do it. That makes no sense. And--wait--I think \nI hear Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison rolling over in their graves.\n  Today, we each will choose to protect every American's freedom to \nvote or allow those supporting the Big Lie to limit people's freedoms \nand undermine our democracy. Today, we will choose to stand with our \nFounders and our Constitution as written or maintain Senate procedures \nthat are seriously broken.\n  It is time to restore the Senate to majority rule, as it was intended \nby the Founders, so we can protect--protect--the American people's \nright to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, as everyone in this Chamber knows, the \nfilibuster requires a supermajority--60 votes--to proceed on most \nissues in the Senate. The filibuster is truly the essence of this \ndeliberative body. It is what makes the Senate the Senate. It is what \nforces collaboration, long-term solutions, and prevents a partisan \nroller coaster ride of ever-changing laws and rules every 2 years. The \nfilibuster puts the brakes on hasty legislation and helps prevent \nunintended consequences, which come with most every new law.\n  I ask America this: Do you want more laws or less laws? Do we want \nmore certainty from our government or less certainty?\n  Arguably, the best speeches to keep the filibuster in place have been \nmade by Presidents and Senators from across the aisle. Nothing is more \nconvincing than my Democrat friends' own words.\n  President Obama, then-Senator Obama, said in a floor speech here in \n2005:\n\n       But the American people sent us here to be their voice. \n     They understand that those voices can at times become loud \n     and argumentative, but they also hope we can disagree without \n     being disagreeable. At the end of the day, they expect both \n     parties to work together to get the people's business done.\n       What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican \n     or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so \n     they can make all the decisions while the other party is told \n     to sit down and keep quiet.\n\n  I am still quoting President Obama here:\n\n       The American people want less partisanship in this town, \n     but everyone in this Chamber knows that if the majority \n     chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the \n     rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting, \n     the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse.\n\n  In that same year, our current majority leader stated from this very \nfloor, and I quote the majority leader again:\n\n       We are on the precipice of a crisis, a constitutional \n     crisis. The checks and balances which have been at the core \n     of this Republic are about to be evaporated by the nuclear \n     option, the checks and balances which say if you get 51 \n     percent of the vote you do not get your way 100 percent of \n     the time. It is amazing. It is almost a temper tantrum by \n     those on the hard right.\n\n  Still quoting the current majority leader:\n\n       That is not becoming of the leadership of the Republican \n     side of the aisle, nor is it becoming of this Republic. That \n     is what we call abuse of power.\n\n  If the current Democrat majority party jams this through, they will \nlive to rue the day, possibly as soon as next year. But for now, my \ncolleagues across the aisle are kowtowing to the radical left base. The \ntail is wagging the proverbial dog.\n  Sadly, 25 of my colleagues across the aisle have flip-flopped from a \nposition they staked out in writing just 4 years ago, but thank \ngoodness that 1 Senator who signed the letter has remained true to his \nword.\n  What has happened to change the minds of these 25 Senators? Why is \nthe national media not asking them the same question? Because it would \npoint out the hypocrisy.\n  Let me remind them all, as President Joe Biden once stated to this \nbody, that removing the 60-vote threshold would, and I again quote--\nagain from President Biden:\n\n       Quite frankly, it is the ultimate act of unfairness to \n     alter the unique responsibility of the Senate and to do so by \n     breaking the very rules of the Senate. . . . Put simply, the \n     nuclear option would transform the Senate from the so-called \n     cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked about to cool the \n     passions of the day, to a pure majoritarian body like \n     parliament. . . . But the Senate is not meant to be a place \n     of pure majoritarianism. At its core, the filibuster is not \n     about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about compromise \n     and moderation.\n\n  These men and women of noble character, in their heart of hearts, do \nthey truly believe in making this rule change that will forever alter \nthe way our government functions, the way our Founding Fathers intended \nit to be? What will they say to the people of their State when the shoe \nis on the other foot, when Republicans hold the majority in the Senate \nonce again and Republicans show them how the hog eats the cabbage?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hickenlooper). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in defense of \nwhat in essence is the very essence of our democracy and the voting \nrights of all Americans.\n  Our dear friend, someone whom I had the privilege of serving with in \nthe House of Representatives, the late John Lewis, took a beating on a \nbridge in Selma for the right to vote. Surely we in the Senate can \nmuster a shred of his courage to protect that right.\n  There are no other rights without the right to vote. It is through \nthe right to vote that freedom rings, that justice reigns and \nopportunity arises.\n  As we all know, this Monday was Dr. Martin Luther King Day, and we \nhave to remember his words: He said:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever--\n\n  Ever--\n\n     devised by human beings for breaking down injustice and \n     destroying the terrible walls which imprison people because \n     they are different from others.\n\n  That is what he called the right to vote--humanity's greatest \ninstrument for advancing progress. Well, the time has come for us to \ndefend it.\n  Now, my colleagues who oppose our voting rights legislation have had \nample time to make their opinions heard. Soon, it will be time to end \ndebate and hold a simple up-or-down vote on the Freedom to Vote Act and \nthe John Lewis Advancement Act. After all, the State legislatures \npassing voter suppression laws across the country are doing so with \nsimple majorities, conservative majorities that in many cases were born \nout of decades of partisan gerrymandering.\n  How about the Supreme Court? It was a simple majority vote of 5 to 4 \nthat gutted the Voting Rights Act. That was the law that John Lewis and \nothers risked their lives for on Bloody Sunday.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended discriminatory tactics that not \nonly blocked Black voters from their ballots but other minorities, too, \nincluding Latinos.\n  Shortly after the Civil War, Latinos held greater political power in \nStates like California, Texas, and Arizona, but as Jim Crow spread \nthroughout the South, they were pushed out of elected positions and \nthreatened with violence for their continued participation.\n  The Voting Rights Act transformed our country for the better. It \ncreated the diverse, multiracial democracy we live in today. I know \nthat my story--the son of first-generation refugees\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nwho came from nothing and rose to become one of 100 U.S. Senators in a \nnation of 350 million people--is only possible because of the civil \nright giants who came before me.\n  The Voting Rights Act ended Jim Crow-era voting laws, and its \npreclearance provision stopped States from resurrecting them in the \nfuture. States and localities with ugly histories of discrimination had \nto get preclearance from the Justice Department before tampering with \ntheir voting laws. Yet, in 2013, the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 ruling in \nShelby County essentially said that racial progress rendered the need \nfor this oversight obsolete--obsolete--as if racism no longer exists in \nthis country.\n\n  The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it best. She \nsaid that ending preclearance when it is continuing to ``stop \ndiscriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a \nrainstorm because you are not getting wet.'' Indeed, that rule opened \nthe floodgates for new voter suppression laws.\n  My colleague from New Jersey often cited Texas. Texas, home to \nmillions of Black and Latino voters, resurrected a strict photo ID law \nthat had been struck down just the year before.\n  Then North Carolina slashed early voting and ended same-day \nregistration with a law that the Fourth Circuit found was \n``intentionally''--intentionally--written to disenfranchise Black \nvoters.\n  Other States, like Alabama, started reducing polling locations in \nminority communities.\n  These measures may not look like poll taxes or literacy tests, but \nthey are the tools of oppression just the same. Their intent is the \nsame--to depress turnout among minority voters--and they threaten the \npromise of our vibrant, multiracial democracy.\n  Now, throughout this debate--I have tried to sit here several hours--\nI have heard our Republican colleagues question, well, why, after \nrecord turnouts in the last Presidential election, would we feel the \nneed to revisit voting rights legislation. Well, the answer is pretty \nsimple: If Republicans systematically were not tearing down the laws \nthat gave rise to the record turnouts, then maybe this wouldn't be \nnecessary. But that is exactly what they have done in State after \nState.\n  Voting rights used to enjoy broad bipartisan support here in the \nSenate. Indeed, Republicans and Democrats stood together for decades to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act, most recently in 2006. In fact, I \nwant to quote one of my colleagues on the day of the last \nreauthorization. He said:\n\n       America's history is a story of ever-increasing freedom, \n     hope, and opportunity for all. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n     represents one of this country's greatest steps forward in \n     that story. . . . Every American must have freedom of \n     political expression--including the free, unfettered right to \n     vote.\n\n  Those words were from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who \nspoke those words on that day. He was 1 of 16 Republicans who proudly \nvoted for the 2006 reauthorization but stand in the way today, 16 \nRepublicans who still are present in the U.S. Senate, including not \nonly him but Senators Grassley, Shelby, Crapo, Collins, Burr, Inhofe, \nGraham, Thune, Cornyn, Blackburn, Blunt, Boozman, Capito, Moran, and \nWicker.\n  That is right--16 Republicans who supported the reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act still serve in this body today. So to them, I \nsay: Join us. Join us. What has changed? What was right then is clearly \nright now. Join us, and we could pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act \nwith a bipartisan supermajority--no change to the rules necessary. Just \njoin us, as you did in 2006.\n  Well, we know that won't happen, not today, not since our democracy \nhas been flooded by a torrential downpour of lies.\n  Earlier this month, we observed the 1-year anniversary of the January \n6 insurrection. A defeated President's violent mob nearly overturned a \nfree and verifiably fair election and tried to overthrow the U.S. \nConstitution. Shots rang out in the Capitol. The Confederate flag waved \nthrough its hallowed halls. That never even happened during the Civil \nWar.\n  A New Jerseyan and Capitol Police officer named Brian Sicknick was \ndrenched in bear spray and later died. Imagine using a toxic substance \nintended to fend off bear attacks on fellow human beings, beating \nofficers within inches of death, and inflicting such painful trauma \nthat multiple officers have since ended their own lives, all because \none man could not accept defeat--a man with an ego so big, he could not \nfathom losing by 7 million votes; an ego so big, he manufactured a lie \nto match it--a lie so big, it inspired violence and nearly brought down \nthe Constitution.\n  That lie should have died within minutes of the former President \nspeaking it. Instead, it lived. The Big Lie lived to grow even bigger \nthanks to a Republican Party that is no longer a party, I believe, of \nprinciple but a party of fealty to a wannabe despot.\n  Since the insurrection, the most anti-democratic laws since Jim Crow \nhave taken the Nation by storm. Last year, 19 States passed nearly \nthree dozen laws undermining access to the ballot box. It is as if they \nare trying to codify the Big Lie into law.\n  In Arizona, Georgia, and other States, they made it harder to vote by \nmail, something that my colleagues have talked about that Americans \nhave been doing for decades and that Republican GOTV efforts one time \nlong embraced it as a way to succeed.\n  They are also removing drop boxes in minority communities under the \nbogus claim that they invite fraud. So when it is in Reverend Warnock's \ncommunity or Senator Padilla's community or Cory Booker's community or \nmy community, somehow that drop box invites fraud just simply because \nit is in our community? Another lie straight from the mouth of a \ndefeated President.\n  And many States are reducing early voting days.\n  When you add up all of these restrictions, what do you get? Longer \nlines at the polls, people giving up, folks who have to get home to \ntheir kids, workers who can't afford to take a day off. To the partisan \narchitects of these laws, their sigh of resignation is music to their \nears. They want to make voting so inconvenient for working people and \ncommunities of color that they don't even bother.\n  The Georgia State legislature gave itself the power to remove \nelection officials that were elected by the people if they don't like \nwhat they see. Simply put, these laws gave State legislatures new tools \nto disregard--disregard--the will of the voters.\n  So I have come to the conclusion that since Republicans cannot win \nelections with the power of their ideas, they are doing everything they \ncan to change the rules of the game so they can win anyway. In doing \nso, they are taking us back to a time and place where injustice \nprevailed, a time and a place that I certainly don't want to go back to \nnor do I want my children or grandchildren to go back to or those whom \nI represent to go back to.\n  Finally, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I \nwould note that when we see an attempted coup or creeping \nauthoritarianism abroad, we call it democratic backsliding. Now other \ncountries are wondering: Is that happening to the United States? \nDictators around the world are jumping for joy. This is what they want \nto see, democracy in disarray. In fact, last November, the Institute \nfor Democracy and Electoral Assistance added the United States to a \nlist of ``backsliding democracies'' for the first time ever--ever.\n  Look, democratic self-government only works when all parties consent \nto be governed by whoever wins the most votes. That is how elections \nwork. We can debate corporate tax rate. We can disagree about financial \naid funding. We can differ over healthcare policy. But the outcome of a \nfair and free election, the sanctity of the right to vote--these are \nnot up for debate.\n  Voting rights are the foundation of this entire democratic \nenterprise, this great American experiment. It is time every Senator \nlooks into their souls and decides how they want to be remembered when \nfuture generations remember this perilous moment in our history.\n  This legislation will protect the rights of all of our voters--young \nand old; rich and poor; Black and White; Latino and Asian; indigenous; \nimmigrant; Republican; Democrat; Independent; the single mom, exhausted \nbut relieved her neighbor could watch the kids so she could make it to \nthe\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\npolls; the warehouse worker who can't afford a day off but winds up \ntaking one anyway; the elderly African-American woman, her hand shaking \nwith determination as she signs her name on a mail-in ballot--she \nremembers life before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and she will never \nforget the sacrifices of those who marched for it, who bled for it, and \neven died for the right to vote.\n  Now, I will just say one final thing. We all take an oath to the \nConstitution. It is required under the Constitution to be sworn in as a \nMember of Congress. And in that Constitution, an amendment that is seen \nonly as it relates to a different time in history, but it is very clear \nand very powerful:\n\n       The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall \n     not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any \n     State on account of race, color, or previous condition of \n     servitude.\n       [And] the Congress shall have power to enforce this article \n     by appropriate legislation.\n\n  These rights enshrined in the Constitution under the 15th amendment, \nthey are certainly being abridged. They are certainly being affected in \na way that we could not fathom in the year 2022. How shameful it would \nbe if we let it slip through our fingers and be buried under an \navalanche of one sore loser's life. How shameful it would be to violate \nour oath to the Constitution, to that 15th amendment, in order to \npreserve some rule that is not in the Constitution and certainly is not \nas enshrined as that right to vote.\n  I hope that those who joined us in 2006 will be there today to vote \nwith us on the Republican side, and if that fails, then I hope we will \nchange the filibuster into a talking filibuster so the Nation can see \nwho stands on the side of ensuring the franchise of that right to vote \nfor every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, something I have been hearing a lot \nlately from members of the media, from many of my Democratic colleagues \nhere in the Senate, and even from the President of the United States is \nthat democracy is at stake, that democracy will die if we don't make \ndrastic changes to our election system, that we are just one election \naway from the end of the experiment our Founders began in 1776.\n  If my colleagues really believe that our democracy is teetering on \nthe edge of the cliff, that it is going to fall over the edge unless we \ntransform the way we run elections across the entire country, then they \nneed to be able to tell the American people why. But, instead, all I am \nhearing from Democrats--even from the President, himself--is that \ndemocracy is on its deathbed; that Americans are no better than George \nWallace or Jefferson Davis if they dare to question that; and that the \nonly solution is for one party to rewrite the rules of the U.S. Senate \nto pass a completely partisan Federal takeover of State and local \nelections. Those are truly some wild claims.\n  If you take these assertions at face value, I can see why some \nAmericans might be concerned about the State of voting rights in this \ncountry, but not a word of what they are saying is true.\n  The good news is that most people live in the real world, where \nAmerica shattered records for voter turnout in the 2020 election and 66 \npercent of eligible voters cast a ballot, the highest level in 120 \nyears. That translates to 156 million Americans, the most in history.\n  In my State of Nebraska, 76 percent of voters cast a ballot in the \nlast election. We have been proud to be a no-excuse State for absentee \nvoting for years since long before the pandemic. We have that law \nbecause we want to make it easier for Nebraskans to vote. And there are \nmany other States that don't require voters to provide a reason before \nvoting by mail, not just Nebraska.\n  Across the country, turnout was up in the last election, regardless \nof race, class, or any other demographic. And according to Pew \nResearch, 94 percent of 2020 voters said voting was easy. Yet Democrats \nstill say voter suppression is rampant in the United States. The \nlogical response to that is to ask: OK, where?\n  In Georgia, Democrats say.\n  After Georgia passed a new law last year, things have apparently \ngotten so bad that the President picked Atlanta to give a recent speech \non the issue. But if you listened to President Biden's speech, you \nmight have noticed that he barely talked about the Georgia law at all. \nAnd when he did, he twisted the law into an unrecognizable caricature, \ninto Jim Crow in the 21st century. He has shamelessly and intentionally \nmisrepresented the Georgia law for months, and his speech last week was \nno different.\n  But something he didn't say in his speech is that the Georgia law \nextends early voting to 2\\1/2\\ weeks. That is longer than blue States \nlike California and New York, and it is longer than the President's \nhome State of Delaware, which currently allows for zero early-voting \ndays. Maybe he should have given that speech at his house in Delaware \ninstead of in Georgia. And he didn't say the language in the Georgia \nbill that requires voter ID for absentee ballots is very similar to a \nbill that passed the Senate almost unanimously in 2002, the Help \nAmerica Vote Act, with President Biden voting in favor.\n  So if the Georgia law is the best Democrats can do, then there is \nsimply no evidence for the idea that Republican State legislatures \naround the country are trying to restrict voting rights.\n  With that in mind, here is a friendly suggestion for the President. \nIf he truly believes, in spite of all that, that democracy itself is at \nstake in a way it has never been before, the last thing he should want \nis for the voting laws of all 50 States to be overseen by the \nDepartment of Justice and a partisan Attorney General. That power \nshould remain with State-level secretaries of state, State \nlegislatures, nonpartisan local officials--anyone but one official at \none Department in one branch of the Federal Government. In other words, \nhe should want exactly the election system we have now. Our \ndecentralized system, with buy-in from a diverse group of voices, is \nwhat allowed States to adapt to the pandemic and achieve voter turnout, \na record turnout in 2020.\n  But the Democrats' Federal election takeover would give the U.S. \nAttorney General the power to oversee every State's electoral process, \nand it would turn the Federal Government into a piggy bank for our \nHouse candidates. Everyone running for election in the House of \nRepresentatives would have access to Federal money through a new \nprogram designed to help them fund their campaigns. The Federal \nGovernment would match contributions 6 to 1, meaning money that belongs \nto taxpayers would go to politicians with views that many of those \ntaxpayers may oppose.\n  This partisan takeover would require States to allow felons to vote \nonce they are out of prison, overruling the States that already have \nlaws in place preventing this. And if Democrats have their way, they \nwill mandate that every single State offer same-day registration at \nevery polling place in the Nation. If you live in a State that has \ndecided that that is not a good idea, well, too bad.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the majority leader wants to get rid \nof the filibuster to accomplish all of this, but what Democrats are \ntrying to do in Congress right now is the best argument I could ever \nimagine for keeping the filibuster. Think about it this way. Let's say \nwe are talking about before the 2020 election and I told you that \nRepublicans would retain the Presidency and the Senate and we would win \nback the House, but the Senate would be split 50-50 and we would barely \nhave a majority in the House.\n  In fact, Republicans are going to have the slimmest majority in \nCongress in more than a century. But guess what: Republicans are going \nto try to pass bills that most Americans don't fully support anyway, \nand we are going to dismantle a rule that has promoted bipartisanship \nand compromise in this body for nearly 200 years to accomplish it.\n  And be honest, you would say that is outrageous, and you would be \nright. It is outrageous. You would be begging those of us on the other \nside of the aisle to leave the filibuster untouched. And if you think \nway, way back into the past--all the way back to 2017 and 2018--\nRepublicans were in the same situation that Democrats are in now. We \nhad a Republican President and majorities in both Chambers of Congress. \nWe had bigger majorities than the Democrats have today.\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\n  The former President even outright asked us to abolish the \nfilibuster, and that brought many, many Democrats to the floor praising \nthe filibuster, saying it should never be abolished.\n  But we didn't abolish it for the simple reason that burning down 200 \nyears of bipartisan history for a few temporary victories is \nshortsighted, at best, and institutional arson, at worst.\n  And don't think that by presenting this talking filibuster Americans \nwon't see the Democrats' efforts for what they really are--a ploy to \nabolish the 60-vote threshold for legislation, to abolish the need for \nbipartisanship, because, in reality, it will only take a majority vote \nto pass controversial bills.\n  Nebraskans can certainly see through this. In Nebraska, State \nsenators have to speak on the floor to filibuster a bill before our \nlegislature, but to overcome the filibuster in Nebraska, you need two-\nthirds of senators to vote to end debate, not the simple majority that \nLeader Schumer has proposed before this body today.\n  Nebraskans have benefited from the consensus-building and the \nmoderation in developing good legislation that this rule promotes for \nnearly 100 years. We know that it works. The 60-vote threshold in the \nU.S. Senate does exactly the same thing for all Americans. So I urge my \nDemocratic colleagues: Don't abolish the filibuster.\n  And if Democrats won't listen to reason from Republicans, they should \nlisten to the President himself.\n  When he was a Senator, he said: ``At its core, the filibuster is not \nabout stopping a nominee or a bill, it's . . . about compromise and \nmoderation.''\n  He has forgotten that now, but that doesn't mean his colleagues who \nare still here have to forget it. Senate Democrats were happy to use \nthe legislative filibuster hundreds of times under President Trump.\n  Not so long ago, it was ``the most important distinction between the \nHouse and the Senate,'' and without it, the Senate would become ``much \nmore subject to the winds of short-term electoral change.'' That was \nthe now-majority leader, and he was 100 percent correct.\n  But now the Democrats are in power, and they have changed their \nminds. Today, the filibuster is not only no longer essential, but \nanyone who supports keeping it is called a racist. That is truly \nincredible, and it is offensive.\n  The Democrats who supported the filibuster a few years ago clearly \nweren't being truthful, and they aren't being truthful now about the \nstate of voting rights in this country.\n  The problem they are responding to simply doesn't exist, and the \nsolution they have for this imaginary problem would do lasting harm to \nour democracy. I will be voting against this partisan takeover of our \nelections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to congratulate all \nof these speakers. It has been wonderful hearing all of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle state their positions, as they have done so \neloquently. We have all learned a lot. I am not sure it has changed \nanything, but we sure have learned a lot in this process.\n  But I rise today to rebut what I believe is a great misleading of the \nAmerican people.\n  Before I get into the details, let me tell you a little bit about \nwhere I come from and my political background. I have been involved in \npublic service in my State of West Virginia for over 40 years, in one \ncapacity or another. I have been in the house of delegates. I have been \nin the State senate for 10 years. I have been secretary of state. I \nhave been Governor for two terms. And now I have been here in the \nSenate for going on 11 years.\n  When I served in the legislature, I could put a bill on the floor or \nI could put a bill in committee, and it would go through committee. It \nwould go to the floor if it came out. I could get amendments on it. \nSometimes it passed; sometimes it didn't.\n  But, at the end of the day, we had a place we called ``Junior \nRules.'' It was behind the senate chamber. You would go behind the \ndoor, and there would be ``Junior Rules.'' After it was over, after we \nhad our debates and discussions--whether it be in committee or whether \nit be on the floor--we would all gather, Democrats and Republicans. We \nate together. We had some refreshments together. We spoke about what \nhappened today and what we could do to make it better tomorrow. I never \ncould understand, when I got here, how divided we were. How did this \nhappen?\n  So I kept thinking, when I first got here they said: Well, you know, \nthe Republicans are over there, and we are the Democrats here, and it \nis nice. We all get along and everything. But now, when they run, we \nhave to be against them.\n  I have to be against you, no matter how close you may be, no matter \nif I sat beside you, no matter if we have dinner at night. If it is \nyour election cycle, I have to be against you. Not only that I am \nsupposed to be against you, I am supposed to basically write a check to \nwhoever is running against you--to whoever is running against you. And \nmaybe, even, they want me to maybe go to your State and campaign \nagainst you.\n  And I am thinking: You know something, where I come from in West \nVirginia, if I went to work during the day and you did that to me, we \nare going to go outside and have a little conversation. That ain't \ngoing to happen back where I come from. And I wasn't going to do it \nhere.\n  Now, if we can change some things, that is what we should be \nchanging. Why should we do this? How are we expected to sit down at the \nend of the day or the end of a session or at the end of anything and \ncome back on Monday and say, ``OK, now, Senator Thune, would you go on \nthis amendment with me and help me with this bill,'' after I just came \nout and basically worked for your opponent that the Democrats have \nrecruited and basically given them money.\n  That is not going to happen. It is not going to happen.\n  So I keep thinking, we keep thinking: What is wrong with the place? \nThat is what is wrong. I tried to get just a little oath that we could \nall sign that we wouldn't do that to each other. I guess there used to \nbe a gentlemen and ladies' agreement that you just didn't do those \nthings, but not anymore, not anymore.\n  I heard about the good old days. I don't know what happened to the \ngood old days, but I can tell you they are not here now.\n  We can talk about a lot of things and the way we want to change, but \nI still really believe we should talk about how we treat each other and \nhow we approach each other in a body that this 330 million people are \ndepending upon.\n  But rules--what little bit we have left that maybe makes us take \npause before we jump off of that bridge--we had better be careful what \nwe are doing.\n  After the State legislature, I also had the privilege to serve as \nWest Virginia's secretary of state. I never one time, as secretary of \nstate in my official capacity, had anyone ever talk to me: We have got \nto suppress the vote. Democrat, Republican, Independent, no matter \nwhat, no one ever came and said: Joe, we have got to stop this group \nfrom voting because that won't help us. No one ever thought that way.\n  You know where most of my ideas came? I brought in early voting. I \nhad a lot of men working in the mines, shift working and all that, and \nsometimes on Tuesdays, on our election day, they couldn't get off. They \nhad to work.\n  So someone says: Do you know what we did in our State? We got early \nvoting. We call it no-excuse voting. You can come any time you want. \nYou have got 7 days, 10 days, 2 weekends, whatever.\n  So I had a hard time getting people to understand. They think: Oh, \nmaybe something bad is going to happen; something nefarious will \nhappen.\n  It took a while for me to get 7 days in, just one week in. I fought \nfor that. After I got 7 days, they wanted more.\n\n  I understand that Kentucky just has early voting, and that is great. \nThey make those decisions.\n  That came out of the experiment we call the great experiment, State \nby State. There are 50 experiments that go on every day in every State. \nWe should learn from them. They should learn from us. We all share \ntogether. We have got many former Governors sitting here. We know how \nthis works. And that is what we are talking about.\n  I also started a program called SHARE. It was the SHARE Program. I\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nhad low turnout in West Virginia, and I was trying to get the turnout \nup. So I am thinking: What can I do? And I always thought this: I can't \nsometimes teach an old dog new tricks, but I can teach a pup some \ntricks and maybe get the old dog to follow him. So I thought of a \nprogram called SHARE, Saving History and Reaching Every Student--Saving \nHistory and Reaching Every Student--because Jennings Randolph, former \nSenator Jennings Randolph in West Virginia, was the father of the 18-\nyear-old vote. It took him 21 years to get it done. He started back in \nWorld War II and didn't get it done until the 1970s--1970. He was the \nfather.\n  So I had the Jennings Randolph award. I had every high school \ncompeting for it, because we went out and educated students that if you \nare 17 years of age and you turn 18 on election day or before--on \ngeneral election day or before--you can vote in the primary election at \n17 years of age. No one knew that. The kids didn't know that.\n  We got them all fired up, and, I mean to tell you, we had awards and \nmade a big ceremony, and all of our election counts went up. Everything \nwent up. We did a good job. And they really, really appreciated it.\n  So we were able to increase the turnouts, but I believe with every \nfiber in my body that every eligible citizen of voting age should have \nthe right to vote and be protected by law--everyone. And I think \neveryone in here believes the same thing--I truly do--that we should be \nable to do that.\n  Later today, we are going to vote. And I am going to vote, again, to \nprotect that right, and I am going to be proud to cosponsor the Freedom \nto Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Amendment Act. We all have \ndifferent positions on that, but I am proud to be a part of that. But \nthat is not what we are debating right now, and I think we all know \nthat. Right now, we are debating a fundamental change in the Senate \nrules that will forever alter the way this body functions.\n  For the last year, my Democratic colleagues have taken to the Senate \nfloor, cable news airwaves, and pages of newspapers across the country \nto argue that repealing the filibuster is actually restoring the Senate \nto the vision that the Founding Fathers intended for this deliberativee \nbody.\n  My friends, that is simply not true. It is just not true. The U.S. \nSenate has never, in 233 years, been able to end debate on legislation \nwith a simple majority vote. With a simple majority vote, they have \nnever been able to end debate. They could not stop the debate.\n  Robert Byrd used to say that there are two things a Senator can do: A \nSenator has a right to amend and a right to speak. He always said that.\n  In fact, prior to 1917, there was no mechanism for ending debate in \nthe Senate whatsoever. You couldn't end it. In that year, the Senate \nadopted the cloture rule. It required the debate to end when two-thirds \nof voting Senators willed it.\n  Since then, the cloture rule has been amended seven times, always by \nregular order. I hear all of these things that we are talking about, \nbut we forget that a lot of things are done with regular order. Just \nrecently, Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell, the debt ceiling--they \ndid that using the rules. You didn't break the rules to do that. You \ndid it. You worked it out, which is the leadership's responsibility.\n  It means that the Senate has followed its own rule book when making \nchanges that affect legislative debate. We have changed rules. We have \nall talked about how many times rules have been changed. We changed \nthem, but we changed them with the rules. We didn't break the rules; we \nchanged the rules. But, all of a sudden, now we just can't do it \nanymore. We just got to blow it up.\n  The rule book means that the rules changes are done on the basis of \nbroad bipartisan consensus, not imposed on the minority by raw majority \npower. No matter who is in power, the majority does not have that power \nto do that in this Senate.\n  Now my colleagues propose to sidestep this process. They would use \nthe nuclear option to override a rule that we have used ourselves but \nnow seem to find unacceptable.\n  Unacceptable now.\n  We are going to break the rules to change the rules. We will make up \nnew rules as we go along and invite ourselves and future majorities to \ndisregard the rule book at will.\n  No rule of the Senate can withstand the act of a willful majority. No \nrule will withstand a willful majority--not the cloture rule or any \nother rule. Let this change happen this way, and the Senate will be a \nbody without rules. There will be no rules.\n  The Senate's greatest rule is the one that is unwritten. This is an \nunwritten rule, and it is the greatest one we have. It is the rule of \nself-restraint, which we have very little of anymore--self-restraint. \nThat rule will be broken along with the cloture rule if the nuclear \noption is executed, and for that--I cannot be a party to that.\n  But there is good news. Here is the good news. We don't have to \nchange the rules to make our case to the American people about voting \nrights, about the John Lewis. We don't have to. We really don't.\n  Senator Schumer didn't have to file cloture to cut off debate. He \ndidn't have to fill the amendment tree to block Republican amendments. \nWe are here. We could have kept voting rights legislation as the \npending business for the Senate today, next week, a month from now. \nThis is important. Let's work it out. Let's stay here and go at it. I \nthink you all are here. Everybody is here. We had a lot of good talks \ntoday. I am sure you have a lot of amendments you would like to make, \nand all of us would like to make amendments. If you want to see it work \nagain, let's do it. Let's go for it.\n  That is exactly what I think should be done. I think the American \npeople really need that. I think that we owe that to them. We wasted a \nyear behind the scenes, partisan negotiations back and forth, talking \nthrough each other, around each other, but not to each other.\n  Let's have the debate, Democrats and Republicans, and let the \nAmerican people decide. The pressure will come. That is what the \nfilibuster is all about. The pressure is mounting until you have made \neither a compromise, you have made a decision; you all have decided to \ngo--you know, one way or another, you are going to end that filibuster. \nAnd today, we haven't seen that.\n  Just 4 years ago, 61 of us, 61 Senators--myself being 1--33 of us on \nthe Democrat side, many of whom are sitting in the Chamber today--you \nhave heard this many times. We sent a letter to Senator Schumer and to \nSenator McConnell warning them of the dangers of eliminating the \nfilibuster. That letter presented a united front committed to \n``preserve the ability of the members to engage in extended debate when \nbills are on the Senate floor.''\n  While some of the Senators have changed their positions, I have not. \nI respect that this is a two-way street, and I would hope you would \nrespect where I am. I respect that you have changed your position on \nthis. I would hope that you would respect that I have not, and I have \nnever wavered on this.\n  I do not and will not attack the content of the character of anybody \nwho has changed their position, and I would hope you would give me the \nsame opportunity and not attack mine.\n  Allowing one party to exert complete control in the Senate with only \na simple majority will only pour fuel on the fire of political whiplash \nand dysfunction that is tearing this Nation apart, and you don't have \nto look very far to see how we are tearing ourselves apart.\n  I can tell you, in every part of this country, people are divided \nnow. It used to be that we couldn't talk about religion at the supper \ntable; now, you can't talk about politics. It has truly become a blood \nsport, and it should not be that way.\n  The rest of the world is looking at us. They are depending on us. \nThey are looking for guidance. They are looking for some stability.\n  If we do this, there is not going to be any check on the executive \nbranch.\n  Bob Byrd was scared to death of not having a check on the executive \nbranch, even when the executive branch was part of his own party, being \na Democrat. He always said: I do not work for the President; I work for \nthe people of West Virginia. He made very sure of that, he made sure \nthat every President knew that, and he made sure he would hold them \naccountable, and\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nthey weren't going to streamroll over him.\n  The filibuster plays an important role in stabilizing our democracy \nfrom the transitory passions of the majority and respecting the input \nof the minority in the Senate.\n  Contrary to what some have said, protecting the role of the minority, \nDemocrat or Republican, has protected us from the volatile political \nswings that we have endured over the last 233 years.\n  The role of the minority is what ensures the policies of our Nation \nhave input from all corners of the country. We must never forget this \nis a Senate made up of 50 States, 100 Senators, blue States and red \nStates.\n\n  For those who believe that bipartisanship is impossible, we have \nproven them wrong. In the last several years, we have made historic \ninvestments in our Nation's public lands, passed trillions of dollars \nin COVID-19 relief, and finally invested in rebuilding our Nation's \ninfrastructure. These critical pieces of legislation have had \nsignificant impacts on Americans across the country. They were passed \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  We can do it again. We truly can. We can make it easier to vote. We \nmust. We can make it harder to cheat. I think we can. We have heard \nfrom our Republican colleagues, who basically agree with us on that. We \ncan reform the Electoral Count Act, which is what caused the \ninsurrection. We agree on that. We can fix that. We will never have to \nwitness another January 6, such an absolutely deplorable stain on this \ngreat country of ours. And we can protect local election officials from \nharassment and intimidation by making them Federal crimes. We can do \nthat, and I know we can do that together.\n  I am going to leave you with this: In May 2010, just a month before \nRobert C. Byrd died--he died in June of 2010. This was a month before. \nSenator Byrd was asked by then-chairman Senator Chuck Schumer of the \nRules Committee--I believe at that time--to testify about the \nfilibuster before the Senate Rules Committee because of his unsurpassed \nknowledge on this subject.\n  Senator Capito knew him well too. She knows how he would pontificate \nat times with us.\n  Senator Byrd began by quoting James Madison. He said:\n\n       Madison said that the purpose of the Senate was ``first, to \n     protect the people against their rulers, secondly, to protect \n     the people against the transient impressions into which they \n     themselves may be led,'' and that the Senate serves as a \n     ``necessary fence against such danger.''\n\n  Senator Byrd testified that ``the right to filibuster anchors this \nnecessary fence.'' He concluded with, ``We must never, ever, ever, ever \ntear down the only wall, the necessary fence, that this nation has \nagainst the excesses of the executive branch and the resultant haste \nand tyranny of the majority.''\n  Eliminating the filibuster would be the easy way out. It wasn't meant \nto be easy.\n  I cannot support such a perilous course for this Nation when elected \nleaders are sent to Washington to unite our country, not to divide our \ncountry. We are called the United States, not the Divided States, and \nputting politics and party aside is what we are supposed to do.\n  It is time that we do the hard work to forge the difficult \ncompromises that can stand the test of time, and that is why we are \nhere--230 years. Think about it. Wars. Depressions. Think of all the \nhardships this country has gone through, all the people who have \nsuffered and fought for every right we have. We are not going \nbackwards.\n  But with that being said, we can do better than what we are doing \ntoday. We truly can. We must promise Americans a brighter future. I \nthink we can do that together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in the last 6 years, Democrats have \nfilibustered 589 bills and nominations--589. That was their right as \nthe minority at the time. That right has been protected. It was their \nright to demand that their voice be heard, but it seems like that was \nthen; this is now.\n  Two years ago, when Senator Tim Scott brought a serious policing \nreform bill to the Senate floor to debate at a moment of national \ndebate on supporting law enforcement, Democrats filibustered that bill \nand would not allow open debate on that bill.\n  Just last week--just last week--55 Senators voted for sanctions on \nRussia as they surround the borders of Ukraine. Just last week, 55 \nSenators voted for that, but that wasn't enough, and the voice of the \nminority was protected when Democrats blocked sanctions on Russia as \nthey threatened Ukraine. That was their right to do, but it seems like \nthat was then; this is now.\n  This letter in 2017 was sent. Twenty-seven Democratic Senators wrote \na letter to Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer asking that there be no \nchanges in the legislative filibuster, including this sentence that \nthey all wrote together:\n\n       We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the \n     legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to \n     ensuring that this great American institution continues to \n     serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore, \n     we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to \n     curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to \n     engage in full, robust, and extended debate, as we consider \n     legislation before this body and in the future.\n\n  That was then; this is now.\n  Then-Senator Kamala Harris, Chris Coons, Patrick Leahy, Dianne \nFeinstein, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Michael \nBennet, Joe Manchin, Angus King, Mark Warner, Bob Casey, Martin \nHeinrich, Jeanne Shaheen, Sherrod Brown, Brian Schatz, Maria Cantwell, \nMazie Hirono, Jon Tester, Tom Carper, Maggie Hassan, Tammy Duckworth, \nTim Kaine, Jack Reed, Ed Markey, Debbie Stabenow, Sheldon Whitehouse, \nand Bob Menendez all asked me to join them in opposing any effort to \ncurtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to engage in \nfull, robust, and extended debate.\n  I will. I would be glad to join you in that because I believe this \nbody is a unique body in the world, just like you did in 2017. I don't \nknow what has changed. Debate is still debate. Difficult issues are \nstill difficult issues. And when my Democratic colleagues filibustered \nalmost 600 times in 6 years, it was their right, as it has been for two \ncenturies.\n  This is the one place in American Government where the voice of the \nminority is heard--the one place. This is the one place where minority \nopinions have to come to the forefront.\n  A discussion about changing the rules of the Senate with simple 51 \nvotes and to be able to shift this to a body, on legislation, where \nwhoever is ahead on the football game gets to decide the rules for the \nrest of the game is not really a set of rules at all, and it will fail \nto protect the voice of the minority in America, this unique thing that \nwe have where even if you lost an election, you know at least your \nvoice can still be heard and you won't be run over.\n  A conversation that is happening in this body today to say we are \ngoing to permanently block out the opinions of the minority in America \nis a wrong decision, and I will join the 27 Democratic Senators who \nasked me 4 years ago to join them in opposing that change because it is \nthe wrong direction.\n  I have enjoyed listening to some of the speeches--and I have listened \nall day to speeches of my Democratic colleagues--about how broken the \nSenate has become and about how it needs to be restored to its status \nas the world's greatest deliberative body. I agree.\n  Senator Manchin, who just spoke before me, made that same challenge \nto say: Let's do it. Let's actually engage in debate. Let's solve these \nissues. Let's actually work behind the scenes. Let's not talk at each \nother through the media; let's actually talk to each other. Let's close \nthe door and actually get a chance to be able to work through things \nand be off the C-SPAN camera for a moment and not do the show. Let's \nactually engage in real dialogue. Let's solve the issues.\n  That is what we are supposed to do. What we are not supposed to do is \nto say: You know what, I don't want to do that kind of hard work behind \nthe scenes. I will just change the rules, blame it on you, and walk \naway.\n  That is not what we are supposed to do as a Senate.\n  I have been told today that I refuse to stand on the side of \ndemocracy. I\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nwas told by President Biden last week that I either stand with the \nRepublican Abraham Lincoln or the Democrat Jefferson Davis and I should \nmake my pick. Well, I would say, for me, personally, as a member of the \nparty of Lincoln, I probably stand with Abraham Lincoln.\n\n  I am concerned that my friends on the other side of the aisle--and I \ndo have many friends on the other side of the aisle. I am concerned \nthat somehow they have convinced themselves that when they filibuster, \nit is righteous, but when I filibuster, it is evil and that this time \nit is different. And somehow with the filibuster, we can change it a \nlittle bit and only be a little bit pregnant, and it will all be fine.\n  I just don't think it is going to work that way, and I think a \ncentury from now writers will look back on this day and will identify \nwhat started the crack--when the Senate started to say: We no longer \nare going to try. We are just going to become the House and run over \nthe minority, and the voice of the minority in America is no longer \ngoing to count.\n  I stand on the side of the filibuster, like Senator Schumer did in \n2017, when he stood right over there and looked in the eyes of Senator \nMcConnell and said, ``I hope the Republican leader and I can, in the \ncoming months, find a way to build a firewall around the legislative \nfilibuster, which is the most important distinction between the Senate \nand the House. Without the 60-vote threshold . . . the Senate becomes a \nmajoritarian institution like the House, much more subject to the winds \nof short-term electoral change. No Senator would like to see that \nhappen so let's find a way to further protect the 60-vote rule for \nlegislation.''\n  I stand with Senator Durbin when he said, ``I can tell you [ending \nthe legislative filibuster] would be the end of the Senate as it was \noriginally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers. We \nhave to acknowledge our respect for the minority, [and] that is what \nthe Senate tries to do in its composition and its procedure.''\n  Listen, we disagree on some elements on this bill, and I have heard \nthe debate.\n  I will tell you, I have been outspoken to protect the rights of every \nindividual to vote in our State. I am proud of the voting laws in my \nState. We have early voting. We have no-excuse absentee voting. We \nengage people to be able to vote in every community, and we fight very \nhard to be able to make sure that every place and every precinct has \nthe shortest line possible. That has been a big deal for our State for \na long time.\n  You go back to the 1965 Voting Rights Act and you look across the \nSouth and the States that went under preclearance, my State was not one \nof those because in my State, even at that time with Jim Crow laws, we \nwere protecting the rights of individuals to be able to vote, as it \nshould be.\n  But my State is being thrown under the bus currently. My State is \ncurrently being accused by some of my colleagues as being a State that \nis on the list of 34 evil States that have passed voter suppression \nlaws in this past year.\n  Do you know what my State's guilt is? We passed a law this past year \nthat said, if you are going to vote absentee by mail, you have to \nrequest it 15 days before the election. We did that because the U.S. \nPostal Service asked us to do that because the U.S. Postal Service said \nif a ballot is going to be mailed out to somebody and get mailed back \nin time and get counted, we need 2 weeks of time to do it, not 7 days.\n  By the way, my State is on the list of the 34 evil States doing voter \nsuppression, but the State of New York passed the exact same law, and \nsomehow, they are not on the evil list. But they also followed the \nencouragement of the U.S. Postal Service to give 15 days for the ballot \nto go out and to come back.\n  My fellow colleagues, that is not voter suppression, that is making \nsure every vote counts--but somehow my State is on the list.\n  We do get a little frustrated when we get accused of being racist \nwhen we disagree on some issues in this bill.\n  We have some disagreements on whether felons, as they walk out, \nshould be able to vote immediately. That has been State-to-State \ndecisions. I understand some States do that, some States do not. My \nState hasn't voted for folks who are convicted sex offenders and \nrapists and murderers, the day they walk out of the prison, to have \ntheir voting rights returned. By the way, some of the folks on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, your State has not either. This bill \nchanges that. Can we have an honest conversation about convicted \nrapists walking out of prison and voting the next week, whether that is \nsomething that should be restored right away--by the way, even during \ntheir time of parole?\n  We have disagreements on voter ID. We have disagreements on same-day \nregistration. We apparently have disagreements on whether we should \nhave House candidates for Federal office get to take a salary from \nFederal tax dollars while they are running for office and get a 6-to-1 \nmatch, where the 6 is the Federal dollars and the 1 is the private \ndollars if you are running for the House of Representatives. No, I \ndon't think I am a racist because I disagree with whether House \ncandidates should be able to take a salary from Federal tax dollars \nwhile they are running for office and get a 6-to-1 match, but that is \nwhat I am being accused of consistently.\n  We have a disagreement on automatic registration of voters. \nApparently, there are some other disagreements because, even in the \nbill itself, it gives a waiver for people who are illegally present in \nthe country who ``accidentally'' get registered to vote; that it gives \nthem some immunity in that process.\n  We have disagreement on how much control unelected folks are going to \nhave on redistricting.\n  We just have disagreements on these things. Can we not have \ndisagreements and debate these things out and not be called a racist in \nthe process; that you are joining with Jefferson Davis if you disagree \nwhether House Members should be paid while they are running for office \nout of Federal tax dollars?\n\n  I don't think this is about voting rights anymore. I think this has \nbecome about power.\n  I don't have any doubt that we need to protect the voting rights of \nevery single individual. That is why I am grateful the 1965 Voting \nRights Act is there. But I want to make sure that we are protecting our \nRepublic and that we stay engaged in what it takes to actually guard, \nday-to-day, how we vote, how we make decisions, and that we admit there \nare differences in voting between Alaska, Oklahoma, and New York.\n  Now, again, we disagree on some things, and there are some things in \nthis bill that even some of the folks in this room, their own States \ndon't agree with. The State of New York doesn't allow same-day \nregistration. In fact, they just voted on that in November and voted it \ndown. The people of New York said: We don't want to do that.\n  The State of New York doesn't allow no-excuse absentee ballots. My \nState does. We have done that for years. The State of New York doesn't \nallow people to bring food and water to people in line. The State of \nNew York requires people to request an absentee ballot to do it 15 days \nbefore the election, exactly like my State does.\n  Listen, let's debate the issues. Let's take the time needed to \nresolve it, and let's actually resolve it.\n  We talked a lot about division and things that are hard. If you don't \nmind me taking a bit of a detour, there are things that we agree and \ndisagree on, some of them profoundly. One of them, I want to mention as \nwell.\n  You know, this week would have been Betty White's 100th birthday. You \ntalk about America's sweetheart. I can't find a soul who doesn't like \nBetty White. If you find somebody who doesn't like Betty White, will \nyou let me know who that is because that is one hard heart.\n  Everyone loves Betty White.\n  Betty White spent 70-plus years raising money in support of the \nHumane Society--overwhelming support, millions of dollars that she \nraised for the Humane Society, and there was broad support for puppies \nand kittens. So I can just ask the question: Who disagrees with Betty \nWhite, puppies, and kittens? See, we have got common ground already.\n  But it is interesting to me, and I am astounded at times, how we see \nsome things so similar and some things so different--hard issues at \ntimes.\n  Let me give you a Rorschach test. Can I do that? You know a Rorschach\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\ntest, the ink blot? Let me give you a Rorschach test.\n  What do you see in that picture? I see a child when I look at it. \nThat looks a lot like a baby to me. Now, you may look at it and say, \n``I don't see it. I see a castle or I see clouds,'' but in this \nparticular Rorschach test, it happens to be a modern sonogram of a \nchild.\n  Why do I bring this up? Why do I bring this to the floor today?\n  It is fascinating to me on the debate today that as a Republican I \ncan be accused over and over of not caring about the challenges of \nvoting in America, when I would be willing to ask the question: Does \nthis child get to vote 18 years from now or does she get disposed of? \nWhat happens to her?\n  I do believe every life matters, no matter how old or how young, how \nsmall or how big, regardless of race or color or national origin or sex \nor ability. All people have inherent value. All people have worth and \nall should be protected in America. This is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  And that child matters. Forty-nine years ago, the Roe v. Wade \ndecision was made. It is coming up this Friday, the 49th anniversary, \nactually. That is why I bring it up.\n  There will be tens of thousands of students out for the March for \nLife. It will be an absolutely spectacular and beautiful display of \ndignity and value of every single human life.\n  In 1973, just a few months after that decision was handed down, \nNellie Gray and some other pro-life leaders like the Knights of \nColumbus and other groups--they decided that one way they could \ncontinue the national dialogue about children was the March for Life \nuntil Roe v. Wade was overturned. And I am going to march again with \nthem this year, and it will be freezing cold again this year, like it \nusually is in late January.\n  A lot has changed since 1973. Times have changed the conversation on \nabortion. Where it used to focus on cells and tissue and viability, now \nscience recognizes that babies can feel pain, have a beating heart. \nThat child already has fingerprints, in fact. By that age right there. \nIt already has fingerprints.\n  By conception, that child has DNA that is different than the mom's \nand different than the dad's. Every single person in this room was once \nin your mom's womb, and the only difference between you now and you \nthen is time. That is it.\n  And I will be very blunt, my greatest hope is that, after 49 years, \nthis will be the last March for Life in a Roe v. Wade America; that \nthis will return back to the States to be able to make decisions.\n  In my State, we will step up to this Rorschach test, and we will say, \n``That looks like a baby to me,'' and we will start protecting the \nvalue of every single child.\n  We have brought bills to this floor that have been filibustered, \nbills on conscience protection, just giving the rights of a nurse--of a \nnurse--who told her employer, ``I don't want to perform abortions. I \nhave a conscience issue with that,'' and then was hired, and later, her \nhospital said, ``You have to participate in this abortion.''\n  We have laws in America that protect that. They just have no teeth at \nall. So individuals do get forced into performing abortions against \ntheir conscience. We brought that to the floor, but it got \nfilibustered.\n  We brought to the floor the protections of children in the womb who \nhave Down syndrome; that they couldn't be aborted simply because they \nhave Down syndrome, but guess what. That got filibustered and blocked.\n  We brought bills to the floor saying that if a child was born alive \nin a botched abortion, they had to get medical care, but it got \nfilibustered and blocked.\n  By the way, I wish the people in this room had the opportunity to \nmeet some of the folks whom I have had the opportunity to be able to \nmeet who are abortion survivors because I hear from people all the \ntime: That never happens. That never happens. I would like you to meet \nsome of them who literally survived a botched abortion, that they were \ndelivered alive and someone in the room took them to the hospital in \ntheir own vehicle, usually, and they survived.\n  I wish you had the opportunity to be able to sit down with Dr. Alveda \nKing. The daughter of Dr. King is a great civil rights leader, and, \nyes, it is the niece of that Dr. King you are thinking of, who is an \noutspoken proponent for life and speaks often of grace to people.\n  I wish we had the opportunity to be able to talk more about chemical \nabortions and what is actually happening in that industry, where people \nare literally being mailed drugs from all over the world to be able to \nperform abortions at their homes or in their dorm rooms or hotel rooms, \nwhere this child is being delivered into a toilet and flushed; about \nhow we have a much larger incidence of deaths of moms in chemical \nabortions than there is in surgical abortions; and about the statistics \nthat have been kept, which, by the way, were blocked from being kept \nand are other than just deaths. From 2007 to 2017, there were 3,800 \nwhat they call adverse events from chemical abortions that had \noccurred.\n  Why do I bring all of this up?\n  I bring it up because this week, we are going to remember 49 years of \nRoe v. Wade, and we are going to start a dialogue in the days ahead \nabout how States are going to handle life and what that Rorschach test \nis. Is that a baby or a tissue? We will have to face that reality.\n  I bring it up because it is a rare moment for us to have a real, \nbipartisan conversation today. As the body knows, it is not often we \nall sit in our chairs and actually talk to each other. We typically \ntalk to each other through the media rather than talk to each other in \nhere.\n  I brought it up because the conversation about her has been \nfilibustered over and over and over and over again, and we don't get to \nhave a real debate about her. We just move on.\n  When do we get to have a conversation about her--that is, a real \ndialogue--and determine what direction we go as a nation? For her sake, \nI hope it is soon because she matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I disagree with the last speaker's \ncharacterization of the issue he was bringing up, but I want to stay \nfocused on voting rights because this is an important moment for the \nU.S. Senate.\n  This is our opportunity to debate the need for voting protection and \nvoting rights, but I do want to make one comment.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that they \nwelcome an opportunity to debate voting rights legislation and talk \nabout ways that we can get this bill to have bipartisan support.\n  The majority leader, several weeks ago, offered a motion to proceed \non voting rights. He filed cloture so that we could get on the bill and \nhave the type of debate that my colleagues now are telling us they want \nto have, and not a single Republican voted to proceed on voting rights \nlegislation at that time. So I find it a little bit disheartening to \nhear this newfound desire to start taking up voting rights when we have \nbeen negotiating and talking and debating this issue now for this \nentire Congress. We also have a historic opportunity to vote on voting \nrights if we take advantage of that opportunity.\n  I represent the State of Maryland, and I know we have talked about 19 \nStates that are moving in the wrong direction on protecting voting \nrights. Maryland is not one of those States. In fact, the Maryland \nLegislature has taken steps to make it easier for voters to be able to \nregister and cast their votes.\n  The Voting Rights Act was authored by my Congressman,   John \nSarbanes, and I am proud of the work that he has done because \nMarylanders recognize that we administer elections locally but that we \nneed national standards, and that is why this legislation is under \nconsideration.\n  After the Civil War and Reconstruction, powerful officials sought to \nnullify the political outcome of the Civil War. They passed laws and \ninstituted policies that enforced segregation. We all know those laws: \nthe Jim Crow laws, the Black Codes, the institutionalized segregation. \nThey were enabled by Jim Crow laws that were aimed at disenfranchising \nminority voters with poll taxes and literacy tests and voter \nintimidation--rationalized in protecting our national security and \nvoter integrity.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  Thanks to courageous leaders, we were able to reverse those laws--by \nPresidents such as Harry Truman, in 1948, in integrating our military; \nby our courts in the landmark decision in 1954 of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, and Marylanders are proud of Thurgood Marshall, a native son \nof Maryland's, in the role that he played in arguing that case before \nthe Supreme Court; and by our Congress with its historic action in 1964 \nto pass the Civil Rights Act, in 1965 to pass the Voting Rights Act, \nand in 1968 to pass the Fair Housing Act.\n  Today, we are now seeing a renewed effort for Jim Crow-type laws, \naimed at disenfranchising targeted voters. My colleagues have talked \nabout it, and I am not going to repeat it here today because I know \nthat time is running short. We know that these laws are aimed at making \nit more difficult for minority communities to be able to cast their \nvotes. My colleague from New Jersey talked about students.\n  Marginal groups are targeted because those who are enacting these \nlaws think it will help them politically. Why now? The answer is pretty \nsimple: the 2020 election. It was an election in which more people \nvoted than ever before, and it was judged to be the most secure \nelection in American history. But because Donald Trump lost, for the \nfirst time in the history of this Nation, we had the loser claim that \nthe election was stolen in order to rationalize his loss.\n  That Big Lie is what motivated legislatures to pass laws to make it \nmore difficult for vulnerable people to be able to vote, to effect \nelection results, presenting a clear danger to our democracy itself on \nvoter integrity and in the confidence of voters that our system is \nactually working.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to show courage to debate, as we are \ndoing today, and to vote on two bills.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act sets minimum Federal standards with State-\nadministered election laws. We have gone through all of the different \nprovisions, so I am not going to go through them again, but we need to \nhave these national standards because of the actions of these 19 States \nand other reasons, such as the dark money that my colleague from Rhode \nIsland pointed out, voter intimidation issues, and restoring democracy. \nThere are so many issues that are in it that are important in order to \nrestore voter confidence.\n  We need to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to \nrestore the Voting Rights Act, because of the Supreme Court's decision, \nand restore precertification.\n  As has been put out by my colleagues, this has been historically \nsupported by both Democrats and Republicans. Again, we need one \nRepublican to vote to proceed to this, for those who are saying they \nare willing to debate this issue. Today, Senators will have the \nopportunity to vote and to be on the right side of history.\n  The Senate filibuster prevented the passage of civil rights \nlegislation to reverse the Jim Crow laws until, finally, in 1964, the \nfilibuster ended, and the Senate voted.\n  By invoking cloture, we can vote now to protect the voting rights of \nAmericans. We can do it right now by passing cloture and being on the \nright side of history. If cloture is denied, we will have the \nopportunity to restore the Senate to its best traditions--to debate and \nvote; to require those who want to use rule XIX--and rule XIX is our \nfilibuster rule--to actually be on the floor and debate. No more pocket \nfilibusters.\n  As for the Senate rules changes that we have all been talking about--\nand I have been listening to my colleagues--let me just talk a little \nbit about changing Senate practice--let alone a constitutional issue, \nsuch as voting rights, should have priority over any of the procedural \nissues that we have here on the floor of the Senate and let alone \nrestoring the Senate to a working body should have priority over the \ninterpretations of some of our rules. Let me talk about the rule \nitself.\n  If you look at the 20th century, basically, legislation was \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate through comity and debate and \ncompromise, and we were able to bring issues to the floor for a vote. \nRarely--very rarely--was a filibuster used. Why? Because you had to \ncome to the floor and talk. It was very time-consuming. It took a lot \nof time off the Senate floor. It was inconvenient for the Member to \nhave to stand up here and talk. So we were able to come together. It \nwasn't through a cloture vote that it ended; it ended because people \ndidn't want to go through the inconvenience of talking or we were able \nto resolve it.\n  We are talking about restoring the Senate to its best traditions. \nMany have talked about, we are going to change the filibuster rule. No, \nwe are not suggesting changing the filibuster rule. The filibuster rule \nis coming to the floor to speak. It is the cloture that is the \n60 votes. You don't need cloture if you run the clock on the \nfilibuster.\n\n  What we need to do is prevent dilatory actions, and that is why the \nleader's point is going to be important. We are trying to restore the \nSenate to a body that can work together by requiring that Members come \nto the floor and speak and vote by how the Framers of the Senate rules \nintended at the end of the day.\n  To my friend from West Virginia, this gives us the chance to start to \nwork together. I couldn't agree with him more. We do need to come \ntogether in a bipartisan way and let our committees work. We need to \nlook into the Senate rules. But we first need to move on action, and \nthis is a fundamental bill that we need to move forward.\n  The leader is framing this in a very narrow way so he can get this \nbill moving and use this as an example to work together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, so the Senate can restore its practices and so we all can \nbe proud Members of a body that debates and votes. That is what we can \ndo while respecting each Member's rights and respecting minority \nrights.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture and, if cloture fails, to \nsupport the leader's point and be on the right side of history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, inflation is at its highest level in 40 \nyears. Drug overdose deaths and illegal border crossings are at record \nlevels. The murder rate is its highest since the 1990s. Russian troops \nare massing on Ukraine's border, and the President of the United States \njust green-lighted Vladimir Putin to invade. China is continuing its \naggression.\n  So what have the Democratic floor leader and Senate Democrats spent \nthe last 2 months doing? Trying to overturn 200 years of Senate rules \nand customs so that they can do things like ban voter ID nationwide and \nuse your tax dollars to support political campaigns.\n  They tell us that Americans are living under Jim Crow 2.0, and they \ncite the recent Georgia election law as proof. Well, let's investigate \nthis so-called voter suppression law.\n  Under the new law, the State of Georgia will have 17 days of early \nvoting. If this is Jim Crow 2.0, then I have bad news because the \nDemocratic leader's home State of New York and the President's home \nState of Delaware were engaged in I guess what you would call Jim Crow \n3.0 as recently as last year because New York only had 9 days of early \nvoting and Delaware had no days--zero days--of early voting.\n  Next, I have heard complaints that Georgia has reduced the number of \nballot drop boxes in the State, even though they now require every \ncounty to have a drop box, as was not the case as recently as 2018, and \nthat Georgia has added new security measures to prevent fraud.\n  Once again, I hate to break the news that the Democratic floor \nleader's home State of New York had zero ballot drop boxes and that the \nPresident's home State of Delaware allowed for just five last year.\n  Of course, one of the Democrats' favorite claims is that all of those \nterrible Republicans down in Georgia have stopped campaign and \npolitical workers from giving food and drinks to people who are waiting \nin line at the polls. Where could Georgia have gotten such an idea? \nWell, as it turns out, the Democratic floor leader's home State of New \nYork also has a nearly identical law banning such electioneering near \npolling places.\n  The Democrats also say that voter ID is a kind of new Jim Crow. That \nmight surprise the 69 percent of Black Americans who support voter ID.\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n  Now, what are they up to? This is an especially good question, given \nthe letter that 28 Democrats, still in the Senate, signed on April 7, \n2017, to the leadership around here, urging them to oppose any effort--\nany effort--to stop the Senate's tradition and custom of extended \ndebate.\n  Some of those Senators are on the floor with us at this moment. I see \nthe junior Senator from Illinois, the junior Senator from Hawaii, and \nthe junior Senator from Maine, the Presiding Officer, for that matter. \nMany more were down here earlier.\n  I would invite, through the Chair, any of those Senators, if they \nwould like to engage in a colloquy, to explain why they have changed \ntheir position since they signed that letter on April 7, 2017.\n  I guess I don't have any takers.\n  I will point out that out of the 28 Democrats who actually signed \nthat letter--\n  Mr. KING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COTTON. I will certainly yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ossoff). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. I am one who signed that letter.\n  First, let's talk about the letter itself. What it says is, ``We are \nunited in our determination to preserve the ability of Members to \nengage in extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.'' I agree \nwith that. The proposal that is going to be put on the floor today is \none that will allow extended debate.\n  There are two points that have caused me to modify the position that \nI took on this letter. One is the nature of the issue that is before \nthe body. If we were here talking about immigration or gun control or \nany of the other many issues that we consider, I wouldn't be taking the \nposition that I am.\n  I believe that the rules of the Senate are important and that \nextended debate is an important part of the Senate process. However, we \nare talking about fundamental structural changes--not policy changes \nbut structural changes--that I believe, in spite of your comments, that \nin many States across the country are compromising the ability of our \npeople to express themselves in our democracy.\n  I consider that qualitatively different than a policy difference, and \nthat is why I am here today to talk about revising the rules--not \nblowing up the filibuster but to get back to what the filibuster \nactually means, and that is extended debate.\n  I am all for extended debate until we are exhausted, until we have \nmade a deal, until we have come to a compromise. But the problem is, \nthe filibuster, as we define it today, is a distant cousin of the real \nfilibuster.\n  The radical change in the filibuster isn't what is being discussed \ntoday. It was made in 1975 almost by accident. In 1975, they were \ndebating whether it should be two-thirds of Senators present and voting \nor a lower number. And they compromised on 60 Senators, sworn Members. \nThat was the focus of that discussion.\n  I have talked to Parliamentarians who were involved in that question. \nI asked the specific question: Did they really realize what they were \ndoing by creating the mail-in, dial-in, no-effort filibuster? And the \nanswer was no. They didn't discuss it. They didn't think of it.\n  So what I am talking about here today and what the proposal that will \nbe on the floor later today is to do exactly what this letter says, \n``extended debate''--``extended debate.'' And that is why I believe \nthat what we are proposing today is in the deepest tradition of the \nU.S. Senate. What we are trying to scale back is the cheap, easy, dial-\nin from your office, 60 votes, de facto, supermajority requirement, \nwhich is not in the Constitution, which the Framers expressly did not \nagree to.\n  They put in a lot of checks and balances. Two Houses of Congress, \ntwo-thirds voting on treaties, two-thirds voting on an amendment, \nconfirmation of the President--the President, the Congress, the \nindependence of the courts, all those were checks and balances. One of \nthem was not a supermajority requirement in the U.S. Senate.\n  Hamilton and Madison expressly said that that would turn democracy on \nits head. Democracy ultimately is about majority rule, and there should \nbe minority rights. The minority should have every opportunity to \nspeak, to offer amendments, to discuss--to offer germane amendments, I \nmight add--and discuss and debate but ultimately not have a veto.\n  That is really what it comes down to here: Do you have a rule that \nsays that the minority actually is in control of the legislative \nprocess? That is not what the Framers intended. It is antithetical to \nwhat the Framers intended.\n  In fact, one of the reasons for the Constitutional Convention was the \ndysfunction of the Articles of Confederation, and one of the reasons \ncited for that dysfunction was a supermajority requirement.\n  So, yes, I voted--what I supported 3 years ago, I still support. The \nlanguage is ``full, robust, and extended debate,'' and that is what is \ngoing to be proposed later on.\n\n  If you guys will vote for it, this debate can go on, as it should, \nfor weeks and perhaps months because it is that important. But I don't \nhave any apologies to make. If I have to choose between a Senate rule, \nas it works now--which, as I say, is a distant cousin of the real \nfilibuster--and democracy itself, I am going to take democracy every \nsingle time.\n  Mr. COTTON. Well, I thank the Senator from Maine for explaining the \nchange in position. I was not seeking an apology, merely an \nexplanation, since I haven't heard that much over the last year or so.\n  I can respond to a few of these points. The Senator from Maine said \nit was the nature of the issue at stake. Well, first off, I will point \nout, I have the letter in front of me here. It is very short. It is \nonly two paragraphs long, but there is nothing in there about the \nnature of the issue at stake, about whether we are talking about \nimmigration or gun control or, in this case, election takeover laws.\n  The Senator from Maine referred to the cheap and easy filibuster. I \ndon't necessarily agree with that characterization, but I would point \nout that that is exactly the kind of cheap and easy filibuster that was \nin place in 2017, when 28 Democrats signed this letter.\n  I will also point out that I wouldn't necessarily agree with the \ncharacterization that the current filibuster was created by accident in \n1975. We are going to have a debate, but the rules and customs under \ndebate today go back to the second decade, the second decade of the \nU.S. Senate. And, perhaps more importantly, every time those rules have \nbeen modified--up to and including the most recent changes on the \nlegislative calendar--they have been modified in accordance with the \nrules, not using the nuclear option, breaking the rules so we can \nchange the rules.\n  I also note we have had a few other signatories to that letter \narrive. We have the senior Senator from Colorado. We have the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire. We have the senior Senator from Montana. \nAnd we have the letter's chief Democratic author, the junior Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  I asked earlier, through the Chair, if any Senators would like to \nexplain their change in position. Since those Senators have joined us, \nif they would like to explain their change, as well, I would invite \nthem into colloquy.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COTTON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. I am struck by your comment that in all \nprevious situations, the rules have been modified by a change in the \nrules that has been done through the rules process because--I would \nencourage you to read up on your Senate history--it is just not the \ncase.\n  In fact, under Senator Byrd's leadership, nine times this Chamber \nchanged the interpretation of existing rules, and they didn't do it \nthrough a formal rules change process. They did it with an \ninterpretation of the Chair being sustained or by reversing the \ninterpretation of the Chair.\n  And you have been here when a nuclear option modified the rules. Your \nparty led the effort to change the requirement for closing debate on \nthe Supreme Court. And you have been here--or I think you were here; \nyour colleagues were here--when they changed the rule, not by changing \nthe rule formally but by reinterpreting it through a nuclear option, in \nregard to decreasing the number of hours for debate on district judges.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  It also goes back to the fact that your team changed the rules, \nwithout going through the formal rule process, on how reconciliation is \ndone in order to be able to do tax cuts for the rich. And then Kent \nConrad, on our side, advocated the change back, and your side, in \npreparation for the Trump tax cuts in 2017, changed the rule again.\n  So at least let us understand that both sides--Democrats and \nRepublicans--have resorted to reinterpreting the rules on various \noccasions. Just a point of clarification that your statement was wrong.\n  Mr. COTTON. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Oregon. And \nI want to commend him for principled consistency on this question. He \ndid not sign that letter.\n  In fact, one of the earliest conversations I had with any Democratic \nSenator in 2015 was with the Senator from Oregon about some of these \nvery questions. He has had these reservations about the cloture rule, \nabout the rights and customs of extended debate. He has not changed his \non this position so I commend him.\n  I will point out, he mentioned the nuclear option on the Supreme \nCourt. Of course, that simply followed what the former Senate \nDemocratic leader Harry Reid did in 2013 on the Executive Calendar.\n  I will also point out that that happened in February or March of \n2017, if I recall. This letter was written in April of 2017.\n  But if there is no more extended debate on this question--oh, I would \ninvite the Senator from Virginia, through the Chair.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, if I might respond.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Senator Cotton, what Angus said.\n  And I am so glad that Senator Lankford has stayed in the room because \nyou have been saying we changed our position. You just really need to \nread the letter. And I do appreciate that you put it up because others \nwere referring to the letter without doing that. The operative phrase \nis exactly what you read: ``We are united in our determination to \npreserve the ability of Members to engage in extended debate when bills \nare on the Senate floor.''\n  We couldn't even debate this bill. You guys wouldn't let us. You kept \nusing the 60-vote block on the motion to proceed so that we couldn't \nget on the bill.\n  In the 5 years since 2017, many of us have come to realize, this is \nwhat we want, but the current abuse of Senate rules is blocking us from \nhaving discussions about voting rights or about matters that you think \nare important.\n  This is still what we want. We want the ability to have extended \ndebate when bills are on the Senate floor. That is what the motion will \neventually be about when we vote on it later today, to move to a \ntalking filibuster instead of a secret filibuster.\n  The way to look at the rule change that we are going to contemplate \nlater is, if you really love the filibuster--and the word \n``filibuster'' isn't in this letter at all, but if you really love the \nfilibuster, do you demand that it stay secret or should it be carried \nout open, publicly, in view of the voters and your Senate colleagues? \nThat is what the vote will be.\n  We have listened to those of you who have said don't abolish the \nfilibuster, don't nuke the filibuster, don't blow up the filibuster, \ndon't weaken the filibuster, and the only change we propose is that the \nfilibuster be a public filibuster, not a secret one.\n  So you stood on the floor and asked if we would join you in that \noperative phrase, ``engage in extended debate when bills are on the \nSenate floor.'' The combination of the block on the motion to proceed, \ntogether with the paper pocket filibuster, where people do not have to \nshow up to speak, much less to vote, we can restore the filibuster, \nfrankly, to what it was during the vast majority of the Senate's \nhistory and require that people actually do it and be accountable to \ntheir colleagues and to the public. And that is what we propose to do.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I invite the Senator from Colorado to \nengage in colloquy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, I appreciate that from the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Just along the lines of what my colleagues have said, I would also \nsay that I want to be very clear that I don't want this place to turn \ninto the House of Representatives. I think that would be a huge \nmistake. But it is not behaving the way that the Founders designed it \nto behave.\n\n  And the history, admittedly, is opaque, but it is very clear to me \nthat the modern abuse of the filibuster represents very little in the \nway of traditional Senate practice or what the Framers were \nconsidering.\n  So I can imagine finding ourselves in a place where we actually have \nextended debate, where we actually have a public filibuster like we \nused to have--everybody remembers the movie version of that; they \nactually did that on the floor of the Senate--versus the secret \nfilibuster that acts as a perpetual veto by the minority on the \nmajority, something that the Framers clearly were trying to avoid and, \nat the same time, gives the minority the chance to hold the floor, \npersuade the American people of their point of view, amend legislation \nin ways that is unimaginable in the House and then, in the end, gives \nthe majority the chance to actually make a decision so we can \neffectively compete with countries all over the world that aren't held \nup by the kind of veto we are talking about.\n  There is not a legislative body in the world that I am aware of, in \nany of the other countries with which we compete, that has a \nfilibuster.\n  So I would say that other piece of this, the idea that we are going \nto seesaw back and forth and back and forth and back and forth--I think \nthe reality is that is not the reality of what happens in other places \nthat don't have the filibuster. And I believe we have the opportunity, \nif we are actually having a public debate--not sitting in our office or \noff fundraising but, instead, having a public debate on the floor of \nthis Senate--that the American people can actually begin to hold people \nhere accountable again for their position on healthcare or guns or \nwhatever it is.\n  We don't ever get the chance to do that here because we never even \nhave a debate in the world's most deliberative body.\n  So if we have a disagreement tonight about the form of all this, my \nhope is that, in the wake of this, if we are not successful, we \nactually do the American people a favor by creating a set of rules that \nactually will make this place work.\n  I have been here now for 12 years. It is hard to believe. I can tell \nyou, the Senate doesn't work. It can't get its basic business done, \nmuch less make hard decisions. I think we can do better than that, and \nI hope we will.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma was directly \naddressed, and I believe he would like to engage in a brief colloquy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend, through the Chair, \nthe Senator from Virginia, for the engagement. We will continue to be \nable to engage and be able to talk through this.\n  Part of our challenge on dealing with this dialogue today is none of \nour side has actually seen the proposal tonight. It is a secret \nproposal that is coming out that all the conversation is that this \nrestores the talking filibuster.\n  We are like: Really? What does it say?\n  Then, in the next, I guess, couple of hours, there is going to be a \nproposal pop and say, ``Here it is; we are changing the rules of the \nSenate with a 51 vote,'' when we haven't even had the opportunity to \neven see it.\n  So we talk about trying to be able to bring dialogue and debate on \nall of these things. That is not dialogue and debate on the rules. That \nis trying to ram through a change with a straight 51 that none of us \nhave even seen.\n  And as we go through this, you had mentioned before the letter that \nis out there. You are correct. I read through the letter. I have \ndefinitely read through the whole letter, but I could have also brought \na bunch of quotes from folks that I see all around the room that make \nstatements like, ``I will never change the legislative filibuster,'' \nor, ``I am 100 percent opposed\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nto changing the legislative filibuster,'' or, ``We should not change \nthe filibuster using the nuclear option.''\n  So there were lots of other quotes from lots of other interviews \nbecause, obviously, around 2017, when the letter came out, there was \nlots of media that asked point-blank: What do you mean by that?\n  And so there is a lot of clarification with it. So you are right. I \nread the letter, and it has the vague language. But I could have read \nlots of quotes that we have that were very, very specific on it.\n  At the end of the day, if we are going to solve the issues in the \nSenate, we are going to have to actually work together to be able to \nsolve the issues. What makes this the greatest deliberative body is not \nthat 51 can do what they want. What will make it the greatest \ndeliberative body is when we have to actually talk to each other.\n  When I was elected in 2014, most of the phone calls that came to me \npersonally between November and January were some of you who called me \nand said: My name is . . . . We are going to disagree on a lot of \nthings, but let's start working now on what we will agree on.\n  If we start doing away with these rules and just move it to a 51 \nbasis, those conversations end and it is not a deliberative body. \nSuddenly, it is a ``we can get what we want with 51'' body. That is the \nHouse. That is why we bring it up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, before I move on from this letter, I just \nhave to note that, as I have said several times, 28 Democrats in the \nSenate today signed that letter. Twenty-seven of them changed their \nposition. There is one signatory who didn't change their position: the \nSenator from West Virginia. Not only did he not change his position in \nthat letter he signed, he has been consistent from the very beginning.\n  He was also here in 2013 when we started down this path on the \nExecutive Calendar. And there are differences, to be sure, between the \nExecutive Calendar and the legislative calendar. The Senator from West \nVirginia is the sole signatory still in the Senate who has been \nconsistent throughout, and I want to commend him for that.\n  And I want to note for the record the Senator from Arizona--\napparently, the only other Democratic Senator who will oppose this \nmaneuver--did not sign the letter in 2017 because she was not in the \nSenate in 2017.\n  So, in conclusion, why are we doing all this? Why are we going down \nthis road? Is it because this legislation is so popular, this issue is \nso important? You would think it was the top issue on the minds of a \nmajority of Americans. But no, according to Gallup, only 1 percent of \nAmericans list elections and Federal election takeovers as their top \npriority.\n  Maybe the majority of Americans support the procedural maneuvering \nhere tonight, the overturning of 200 years of Senate rules and \ncustoms--nope, wrong again. According to a recent CBS poll, barely a \nthird of Americans support this.\n  And while we are waiting here for the Democrats' doomed charge to \noverturn 200 years of Senate rules and customs and federalize our \nelections, Americans are dealing with very real, concrete, kitchen-\ntable issues. Our people are getting poorer. Inflation rose by 7 \npercent over the last year, the highest rate in 40 years. Wages are \nfailing to keep up. Inflation might not be so bad for some of the \nmillionaires around here, with their stock portfolios and their real \nestate, but for most Americans it is crippling, and it is most \ncrippling for those who can least afford it.\n\n  I shouldn't have to point out that people are dying in our \ncommunities all across the country. Murder was up by its highest record \nlevel in the keeping of modern records last year, and it is up again \nthis year, at a time when we also have 100,000 Americans dying of \noverdoses, the highest number ever reported--another grim record.\n  Meanwhile, America is being overwhelmed at our southern border. \nBorder Patrol is stopping more than 175,000 illegal immigrants at our \nsouthern border each month. We can only guess how many more are getting \nthrough.\n  These are all the real problems that the American people have told us \nrepeatedly they want us to address, but we haven't heard much about \nthose problems. We are not here in session this week to debate those \nproblems. The Democrats apparently don't want to acknowledge these \ncrises because they created these crises and they have no solution for \nthese crises.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. HASSAN. Just briefly, Mr. President, I know I was not scheduled \nto speak, but I do want to respond as one of the signatories of the \nletter.\n  I associate myself with everything that the other signatories have \ntalked about in terms of wanting to restore the Senate's tradition of \nextended debate on issues of grave importance to the American people. \nBut let me be clear about the reason that I now support an adjustment \nto the longstanding rules of the Senate. It is because I never \nimagined, when I signed that letter, that not a single Member of the \nRepublican Party would stand up for our democracy since January 6, when \nwe saw an acceleration of State laws that would allow partisans to \noverturn the impartial count of an election.\n  We need to address the issues that so many of us have talked about \nhere. The people of New Hampshire, the people all across the country, \nthey need us to address pressing issues like lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs or making it easy for families to afford childcare.\n  But if we do not have a functioning democracy where people know that, \nwhen they vote, that vote will be impartially counted and upheld and \nthat people who are defeated will accept defeat so that they can have \nan accountable elected representation in Washington, then there is no \ndemocracy.\n  When I signed that letter, I never imagined that today's Republican \nParty would fail to stand up for democracy.\n  I was raised by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge. He would talk \nto us at the breakfast table, and the question was, ``What are you \ngoing to do for freedom today?'' It was a big question to ask \nelementary schoolkids, to be sure, but he had a right to ask it, as \ndoes every veteran who has fought for this country, including my \ncolleague Senator Cotton.\n  But the Republican Party and the Democratic Party must unite to stand \nfor freedom and to stand for an accountable democracy because, without \nthat, the rules of this body do not matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I can't think of a more important thing \nto be debating here in these Chambers than the right to vote. We can't \neven get to that. We can't even get to that because of the use of the \nfilibuster to prevent us from having a vote, a discussion, on the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  In America, the path toward justice has always, always been \nintertwined with the right to vote. Progress and enfranchisement have \nalways been braided together.\n  Billy clubs, whips, barbed wire, wrapped tubing--that is what awaited \nJohn Lewis at the end of that Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma because it \nhas never been easy--it has never been easy--to fight for \nenfranchisement or to fight for the right to vote. There has always \nbeen a price to pay by those who focus on justice.\n  Shouted slurs, explosions of tear gas, pained screams, and the crack \nof clubs against bone--those were the sounds that filled the air as \nLewis and hundreds of his fellow Americans tried to march forward as \nthey tried to bring their country forward one step at a time.\n  Most of us in this room know of those mothers and fathers of the \ncivil rights movement, what they did for us that day. They raised their \nvoice on that bridge so that fellow Americans could raise their voices \nat the ballot box. Tragically, we also know that many in this Chamber \ntoday appear unwilling to do their part to protect the rights those \nheroes fought for.\n  More than a half century ago, in this very building, Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle came together to pass the Voting Rights Act, a \nbill designed to protect Black Americans--to protect all Americans--\nfrom the kind of racial discrimination that was so common in State-run \nelections at that time.\n  Of course, it is not possible to list out all the changes that have \ntaken\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nplace since that moment. More and more civil rights advocates stood up \nand sat in. More and more Americans marched through and then laid down \nin the streets. And the moral arc of the universe that Dr. Martin \nLuther King spoke of bent a little more toward justice with every hard-\nearned right they secured and every fight that they won.\n  But, sadly, damningly, one other change stands out to me as I speak \nhere today. More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act became law, \nwe can no longer say that a bipartisan majority of the Senate is \nwilling to protect the most basic tenet of our democracy. Heck, we \ndon't even have all of the Senators in the room to discuss this. Every \nAmerican's right to make their voice heard is so critically important \nto our democracy. We can't say this because Senate Republicans have \nspent the past year blocking every Democratic attempt to even begin \ndebate on strengthening voter legislation.\n  Even as Republicans in States around the country pass more and more \nrestrictive voter suppression laws aimed at silencing the voice of the \npeople, we still struggle and beg to have this debate, and they will \nnot vote to allow us to do so.\n  Republicans in Georgia made it illegal to peremptorily mail out \nabsentee mail out absentee ballots to registered voters, a law that \nhurts all groups that rely on voting by mail, from communities of color \nto Americans living with disabilities.\n  It also hurts military voters currently serving in harm's way \noverseas. I myself voted by mail when I was serving our country in \nIraq. After all, I was a little busy flying combat missions, so I don't \nknow if I would have had the chance to request an absentee ballot 15 \ndays before the election if my unit had not assisted in that effort. \nNot every unit may do that. And so not having their ballots mailed to \nthem would make it immeasurably harder for our troops to vote wherever \nthey may be serving.\n  I can't understand why Republicans would want to make it harder for \nbrave Americans, defending our democracy abroad, to participate in it, \nbut that is what they are doing.\n  And I can't understand how my Republican colleagues can sit here \ntoday and ask paid staffers and pages to bring them water, at exactly \nthe temperature they like, with or without ice, sparkling or not \nsparkling, as they make their voices heard on the Senate floor and then \nsay nothing--nothing--to stop a law that makes it illegal to give water \nto Americans waiting hours in line at polling stations as they seek to \nsimply have their voices heard at the ballot box.\n  Listen, my five-times great-grandfathers, who were likely indentured \nservants without the right to vote, didn't fight in the Revolutionary \nWar and earn that right to vote just so people claiming to be the \nleaders of our generation could chip away at the fundamental idea that \nfounded this Nation: that everyone is equal.\n  And my buddies and I and Senator Cotton didn't sign up to defend our \ndemocracy in war zones thousands of miles away only to watch it crumble \nat the hands of powerful people more focused on their own self-\ninterests than in the foundational component of this extraordinary \nexperiment that we call America; that everyone, regardless of social \nstatus, wealth, skin color, sex, has a right to vote.\n  Page after page in our Nation's history is marred by bigotry, tainted \nby intolerance, by injustice, but through every chapter--however dark \nthe night--some brave Americans have willed that there would be light.\n  That march forward has always been to expand access to the polls, not \nto decrease it--expanded access for those who didn't own land, for \nBlack Americans after the Civil War, for women, for all Americans.\n  In World War II, Black Americans fought overseas for the same country \nthat forced their families to sit at segregated lunch counters back \nhome. Then they came home and were forced to guess how many jelly beans \nwere in a jar before they, themselves, could vote in a country that \nthey had fought for.\n  Asian Americans fought to end slavery in the Civil War, sacrificed to \npreserve this Union, and then had their earned citizenship stripped \naway. Decades later, their grandsons fought in Europe even as their \nloved ones were interred in camps on American soil. And we march \nforward, and we march on, and we expand the right to the ballot box.\n  In the sixties, White Americans hopped on buses and risked their \nlives Freedom Riding through the South so those with darker skin could \nwalk into the ballot box without fear of billy clubs.\n  And Americans of all backgrounds have packed their rucks, laced up \ntheir boots, and gone to war in places like Iraq, lost their lives in \nplaces like Afghanistan, to defend the most American belief: that we \nall have a voice and we all have the right to use it, including at the \npolls, because voting to elect one's own government is the core of that \nright.\n  I am not asking anyone to do anything nearly as difficult as putting \non a uniform and going to war or crossing a bridge and being met with \nbilly clubs. I am not asking anybody to do anything that difficult \ntoday. I am not asking my Republican colleagues to risk their lives on \na bus or a bridge, in the heat of the American South or under the \nscorching Sun of a desert in the Middle East. All I am asking for is \nthe bare minimum. All I am begging them to do is merely to not sit in \nsilence in the face of grave injustice, to not let being partisan keep \nthem from being a patriot.\n  For the sake of all who have sacrificed for this Nation, I, at least, \nrefuse to remain silent. That is why I am voting for these bills. That \nis why I am trying to claw back some of the protections that \nRepublicans have spent the last year trying to erode on the back of the \nBig Lie, including expanded voter purges, increased barriers for voters \nwith disabilities, and harsher voter ID requirements.\n  That is why I am asking my colleagues who claim to represent the \nparty of Lincoln, as a junior Senator from the ``Land of Lincoln,'' I \nask you to act in a way that will further the cause of justice. That is \nwhy I am working to restore the Voting Rights Act, to expand early \nvoting and vote-by-mail, to limit special interest money in politics, \nand to actually try to protect underserved communities and our \nservicemembers' rights to vote--because not only can our country do \nbetter, we have done better. Back when we passed the Voting Rights Act \nall those decades ago, not only can our Chamber do more, we have done \nmore, including the 16 Republicans who are still in the Senate today \nwho have previously voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  And we owe more to those heroes who fought these fights before us, \nthose trailblazers who marched those bridges while those in power broke \ntheir bones, whose skulls were cracked, whose blood was shed, yet whose \nwill never bent, whose determination never wavered, those heroes who \nnever let what was hard deter them from doing what was right. We owe it \nto each of them--and to those whose rights are at risk today--to pass \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                                Abortion\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today ahead of the 49th anniversary \nof the Supreme Court's tragic decision in Roe v. Wade. You might ask: \nWhat does that have to do with voting rights? It has a lot to do with \nvoting rights because, after all, you can't have the right to vote \nwithout first having the right to life.\n  Every year, for nearly five decades, thousands of pro-life Americans \nhave faithfully gathered here in DC and across this country to mark \nthis dark day by marching for life and being a voice for the voiceless.\n  This year's official March for Life comes at a turning point in our \nNation's history. On December 1 of last year, the Supreme Court heard \noral arguments on the landmark 15-week abortion case out of \nMississippi, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.\n  This is the first case in our generation that presents the Supreme \nCourt of the United States the best opportunity to right its historic \ninjustice and finally overturn Roe v. Wade.\n  The Roe decision has resulted in the deaths of more than 63 million \ninnocent babies--63 million. In fact, as I stand here and speak today, \n2,363\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\npreborn children are being killed in this country--2,363 are killed \nevery single day.\n  These precious lives were created by God and intended for this world \nbut were violently deprived of their lives because they were deemed \nunwanted, unfit, or simply inconvenient. And because they are so small, \nwithout voices of their own, far too many, for far too long, have \nignored their desperate cries. Because of Roe, States have virtually \nbeen powerless to stop this tidal wave of bloodshed.\n  What is more, Roe's extreme abortion regime has made the United \nStates a global outlier on abortion. We are just one of seven nations, \nincluding China and North Korea, that allow abortions on demand--just \none of seven nations--past the point babies feel pain, all the way up \nuntil the moment of birth. It is barbaric.\n  Because of science and technology today, it is impossible to ignore \nthe humanity of that little baby growing in the womb. Thanks to \nincredible 4D ultrasound technology, we can watch babies grow. We can \nhear their hearts beat. We can watch them yawn, even suck their thumbs.\n  We have come a long way since 1973. It is time our laws catch up with \nthe science. Overturning Roe will not--I repeat, will not--ban abortion \nnationwide. And I am sad to say that some of my colleagues are not \nbeing truthful on what it might mean if Roe v. Wade is overturned. It \nwill not ban abortions nationwide. It will return the power to pass \npro-life laws to State and Federal lawmakers.\n  In fact, according to a recent Marist poll, 80 percent of Americans \nare opposed to abortions after the first 3 months of pregnancy. That is \nan overwhelming majority of the American people. But because of Roe, \ntheir voices are being silenced. It is time for the Supreme Court to \nallow State and Federal lawmakers to rightfully represent their \nconstituents and protect the most vulnerable among us.\n  It is time that we as the United States of America--a nation who is \nsupposed to be the leaders in the world of human rights--recognize what \nhappens to be the theme of this year's March for Life, which is that \nequality begins in the womb.\n  The Dobbs case before the Supreme Court gives the Court a chance to \nfinally restore justice and equality of the most vulnerable among us, \nin the spirit of this Nation's long history of progress in civil \nrights.\n  In listening to oral arguments in the Dobbs case, I was struck by \nsomething Justice Kavanaugh said.\n\n       If you think about some of the most important cases, the \n     most consequential cases in this court's history, there's a \n     string of them where the cases overruled precedent.\n\n  Justice Kavanaugh cited most notably Brown v. Board of Education in \n1954, which outlawed a separate but equal, overturning Plessy v. \nFerguson decided in 1896. It took 58 years for the Court to recognize \nthe obvious truth that racial segregation was wrong and overturn its \ngrievous error in Plessy. Justice John Marshall Harlan showed \ntremendous courage as the lone dissenter from the Court decision in \nPlessy.\n\n  Now, it has taken 49 years for the Court to consider the obvious \ntruth that all life must be protected. It has taken 49 years since Roe \nv. Wade for the Court to reconsider this wrongly decided case.\n  In the spirit of Justice Harlan, who dissented in Plessy, I would \nlike to share a quote from another great dissenter proved right in the \ncourse of history, and that is Justice Byron White. Justice White, with \nhis 1973 dissent, joined by Justice Rehnquist, in Doe v. Bolton, the \ncompanion case to Roe v. Wade wrote as follows:\n\n       With all due respect, I dissent. I find nothing in the \n     language or history of the Constitution to support the \n     Court's judgment.\n       The Court simply fashions and announces a new \n     constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely \n     any reason or authority for its action, invests that right in \n     sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion \n     statutes.\n       The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the \n     50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the \n     relative importance of the continued existence and \n     development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum \n     of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand.\n       As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has \n     authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its \n     judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the \n     power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to \n     this Court.\n       The Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant \n     mother more than the continued existence and development of \n     the life or potential life that she carries. Whether or not I \n     might agree with that marshaling of values, I can in no event \n     join the Court's judgment because I find no constitutional \n     warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the \n     people and legislatures of the States. In a sensitive area \n     such as this, involving as it does issues over which \n     reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot \n     accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by \n     interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to \n     protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with \n     the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This \n     issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and \n     to the political processes the people have devised to govern \n     their affairs.\n\n  Justice White was correct. I share that belief. The Court's decision \nin Roe was a travesty of constitutional law and human rights, one that \nshould follow Plessy v. Ferguson to the ash heap of history.\n  In the Dobbs case, I pray that we see the Supreme Court do precisely \nthis: correct this historic injustice and uphold Mississippi's 15-week \nabortion law.\n  For the pro-life movement, overturning Roe is not the end; it is just \nthe beginning. States across the country stand ready to protect life \nand provide support for pregnant moms facing crisis pregnancies.\n  I pray this year's March for Life marks the final anniversary of Roe \nv. Wade and heralds the dawn of a new day, where every life is \nprotected.\n  I want to thank the thousands of Americans across the country who \nwill be joining this year's March for Life. I would also like to thank \nthe hundreds of Montanans who joined me just last week in Helena for \nlast week's March for Life. I stand with you, and we will continue to \nfight to protect all life.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. President, last year we saw Democrats like Stacey Abrams and \nPresident Biden mislead the American people about Georgia's new voting \nlaw. In fact, the Washington Post fact checker wrote:\n\n       Biden falsely claims the new Georgia law ends voting hours \n     early.\n\n  That was given four Pinocchios by the Washington Post.\n  However, today, in this Chamber, we have seen several Senate \nDemocrats challenge Montana's commonsense election integrity laws \nchampioned by the Montana Legislature; the secretary of state of \nMontana, Christi Jacobsen; and the Montana Governor, Greg Gianforte.\n  I want to set the record straight. Montana put in place some \ncommonsense reforms that enjoy the strong support of Montanans, like \nstrengthening voter ID laws and preventing paid ballot harvesting.\n  There have been some things said here on the floor that are, frankly, \nnot true. Ballot harvesting is still OK in Montana; you just can't pay \npeople to do it.\n  In fact, there were statements made that somehow student IDs are not \nallowed anymore to vote, that somehow that is going to be the end of \ndemocracy. Well, listen, under current law--first of all, most students \nhave a valid driver's license in Montana, but if you didn't, the \nrequirement is this--and I take this chapter and verse off of the \nsecretary of state's site--you can still use a student ID to vote in \nMontana; you just have to have a secondary identification. That can be \na ski pass, a gym membership, so long as both identification types are \npresented.\n  First of all, most students have valid driver's licenses. If you \ndon't, you can still use a student ID. You just have to have a \nsecondary identification type presented, like a ski pass, gym \nmembership, or even a transcript. That does not seem unreasonable, and \nthe vast majority of Montanans believe that just makes sense.\n  Furthermore, we have seen questions--in fact, Senator Schumer made \nsome accusation about Montana shortening the hours for elections. I \nfound that a bit hilarious, frankly, because here is what we did in \nMontana. All voter registration activities are allowed now up until the \nnight before the election. Up until the day of the election, you are \nallowed to register to vote, unlike New York, which ends voter \nregistration 25 days before the\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nelection. I don't think that is going to be the end of democracy when \nMontana has far easier, far better laws here to make it easier to vote \nin Montana than they do in New York.\n  In fact, regarding New York, the voters last November rejected same-\nday voter registration and rejected universal absentee voting. States \nacross this country have been working hard to ensure that we are making \nit easier to vote but making it more difficult to cheat.\n  I am grateful for what has been happening in the State of Montana. It \nis a no-brainer to most Montanans that you need a valid ID, a driver's \nlicense, to get a hunting or fishing license, to rent a car, to get \nonto an airplane, not to mention the fact that in many liberal-run \ncities now across our country, the Democrats are now enforcing ID \nchecks to get into a coffee shop or sit down for dinner.\n  So it is no wonder we are left a little confused here by how \nPresident Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats want to override \nthe will of Montanans and undermine our State voter ID laws when it \ncomes to maintaining something as foundational as our democracy and \nmaintaining integrity in our elections.\n  If there is one thing Montanans are about, it is common sense. The \nfearmongering, the falsehoods, and the misleading statements from the \nDemocrats don't make a whole lot of sense, and Montanans know it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ossoff). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I wasn't going to speak, but I have to speak because I \nwanted to clear up the record on one thing.\n  The people in the State of Montana voted for same-day registration. \nThe people of the State of Montana went to the ballot box and voted for \nsame-day registration. The State legislature repealed that. We should \nask what the people of Montana really want. They want same-day \nregistration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LUJAN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking all the \nSenators who have come to the floor to make the case for democracy and \nfor voting rights. The right to vote is the heartbeat of our democracy. \nIt is a symbol of the progress that we have made in this Chamber and \nthe promise that we have made to the next generation of Americans.\n  This legislation will protect the right to vote for all, safeguard \nagainst election sabotage, end partisan gerrymandering, and limit the \ninfluence of dark money in politics so that billionaires and \ncorporations cannot buy elections. Protecting our democracy should not \nbe partisan; it should be a moral and civic imperative for every one of \nus.\n  As a former U.S. Senator from New Mexico, the late Dennis Chavez, who \nserved in this Chamber for 27 years until his passing in 1962, said:\n\n       Either we are all free, or we fail; democracy belongs to \n     all of us.\n\n  Our democracy faces clear and present dangers posed by Republican-led \nState legislatures across the country. Some lawmakers want to curtail \nthe right to vote--not for all Americans but for the most vulnerable \nand historically disenfranchised. And if we think it is bad now with \nwhat has happened in these State legislatures over these last few \nmonths, it is about to get a lot worse.\n  History will not look kindly on inaction at this critical moment, and \nwe must show the American people that we will not flinch when faced \nwith a choice to protect our democracy and let it crumble before our \neyes.\n  There is a pattern of rampant discrimination that is disenfranchising \ncountless Black and Brown voters across this country.\n  In 2005, Jesus Gonzalez became a naturalized citizen. On the same day \nhe swore an oath to the United States, he sought to register to vote in \nArizona. He was rejected, so he tried again after he obtained a \nlicense, but again he was rejected. It was then that Mr. Gonzalez, a \nschool janitor, sued the State. His case made its way to the Supreme \nCourt, which in 2013 ruled in his favor and struck down Arizona's law. \nMr. Gonzalez was 1 of 31,000 voters in Arizona affected by such a \ndiscriminatory law.\n\n  Just this past September, the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund \njoined other civil rights organizations in suing Texas over its \ndiscriminatory voting legislation known as S.B. 1. We have heard a lot \nabout it today. Among other things, S.B. 1 seeks to curb the assistance \navailable to limited English-proficient voters.\n  In 2006, MALDEF successfully sued Texas after the State legislature \nsought to dilute the Latino vote. In that case, LULAC v. Perry, the \nSupreme Court found that Texas violated the Voting Rights Act by \ndenying Latinos the ability to elect a candidate of their choosing.\n  In 2017, MALDEF again sued Texas after the city of Pasadena sought to \nweaken the Latino vote by changing the way the city elected city \ncouncil members.\n  These are just some of the chapters of a long history of voter \nsuppression.\n  We also know that voter suppression of Native Americans is real, and \nit is intentional.\n  Until 2020, North Dakota voter ID laws required a residential street \naddress. Now, that may sound like common sense to some folks, but for \nthose of us who live in rural communities and for my brothers and \nsisters who live in Native American communities, we all grew up with \nrural route boxes. My address growing up was Route 1, Box 102, not \nbecause I didn't want a street address named after my grandparents like \nit is today; that was the address.\n  Because of that law in North Dakota, many Native Americans, like \nRichard Brakebill, who is a Navy veteran, have been denied the right to \nvote because of an expired driver's license and a Tribal ID that--get \nthis--did not have a current residential address. It had the post \noffice box that was his address.\n  In 2020, the candidacy of Joseph Dedman for county sheriff--a member \nof the Navajo Nation--was challenged in Arizona because he included \npost office boxes, which are often the only form of address for rural \nNative American households--it is the only one they can obtain--on his \npetition for office.\n  In 2020, Arizona's Pima County closed the early voting center on \nPascua Yaqui lands and spent nearly $200,000 in legal fees rather than \nreinstate the voting center.\n  South Dakota provided a fully funded polling place and early voting \nand registration opportunities to the 12 non-Native American residents \nin Gann Valley, but--get this--they refused to provide the same \nservices to the 1,200-plus residents in Fort Thompson on Crow Creek \nTribal lands.\n  In 2021, Kimberly Dillon, a citizen of Rosebud Sioux Tribe, joined \nthe Oglala and Rosebud Sioux Tribes in suing South Dakota for requiring \nvoters to register at State agencies and DMVs, which were hours away \nfrom Tribal lands. They were making it harder for people to register to \nvote by saying: Drive 3 or 4 hours away. Those are tough roads to drive \non.\n  Many Native Americans like Kimberly went to great lengths to submit \ntheir voter registration applications to those State agencies, but the \nagencies never sent them to the local election offices even after they \ntraversed and got the job done in making that journey. They just want \nto submit them to let them get registered to vote. As a result, her \nright to vote in the 2020 Presidential election was taken away.\n  Kimberly asked:\n\n       How many other people faced this violation of our basic \n     freedom to vote? We cannot allow voter suppression to \n     continue in South Dakota or anywhere in Native America.\n\n  These are American citizens whose rights were taken away from them \nfor partisan advantage. Jesus and Kimberly's voices were taken away \nfrom them just like countless other Americans who face the same \ndiscrimination.\n  Nineteen States have passed 34 laws making it easier to sabotage \nelection laws and target voters of color, and not all of them had a \nsupermajority of two-thirds vote.\n  In 2016, Representative David Lewis, a Republican State lawmaker in \nNorth Carolina and member of the general assembly's redistricting \ncommittee, said:\n\n       I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan \n     advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats \n     [representatives] . . . because I do not believe it's \n     possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\n\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\n\n  This is not new. This has been going on decade after decade. The only \nthing that is different now is that in 2013, when the Supreme Court \ngutted the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Republican-\nled legislatures don't have to hide behind it any longer. Now they just \nsay they are going to draw for partisan advantage. They are going to \nchange the rules to keep certain communities from voting, making it \nharder for people to get to that ballot box.\n  This is nothing new, and shame on all of us for not acting when the \nSupreme Court told us this in 2013. That is on all of us. But we are \nhere today.\n  We are also seeing an uptick in violence as a result of the lies \nacross the country--the Big Lie. The Department of Homeland Security \nhas seen an increase in calls for violence as a result of these \nbaseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. We are losing honest \nelection officials and poll workers because of threats against their \nlives due to conspiracy theories and lies pushed by the former \nPresident.\n  The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act will protect the vote of \nworking families across the country. Only one archaic parliamentary \nmeasure prohibits all this progress.\n  The filibuster does not increase deliberation in this Chamber. It \ndoes not incentivize compromise. So while some claim that amending the \nfilibuster will further the country's division, I disagree. Right now, \nit is only aiding and abetting obstructionists and opponents of \nprogress when it comes to voting on civil rights legislation.\n  While the filibuster is not mentioned a single time in the \nConstitution--\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague stop for a brief interruption?\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \nmotion to concur be at 8 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague. We had no choice but to do \nit at 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LUJAN. So the importance of us being here today goes right in the \nface of having this conversation as a debate. I appreciate my \nRepublican colleagues who have come to the floor to engage in some \ndebate, in some colloquy.\n  I, like Senator Kaine, came to the Senate a bit naive. I thought \ndebate happened here all the time. I came here thinking that I could \noffer an amendment at any time, that I could offer a unanimous consent \nat any time. That is not the case. This is not the Senate that our \nFounders envisioned.\n  Now, if you feel moved to oppose a piece of legislation, if you are \npassionate about an issue, you should have the courage to come to the \nSenate floor in front of your colleagues and the American people.\n  You should not be allowed to vote it in from behind closed doors. \nThis Chamber has changed, just as the times have changed. So it is the \nresponsibility of every one of us to make sure that the Senate works \nbetter, not for us but for the American people.\n  Now, in closing, in 1805, Vice President Aaron Burr suggested that \nthe Senate remove from its rules the ``previous question motion,'' \nwhich allowed the Chamber's simple majority to end debate on a bill. He \nviewed the rule as completely unnecessary and urged the Senate to clean \nup its rule book because after everyone had spoken and debated, they \nwould vote.\n  A year later, the Senate removed the previous question motion, \nleaving a loophole that allowed the minority to take advantage and use \nwhat we now know as the filibuster. Unfortunately, Burr could not \nforesee the obstructionism of decades to come.\n  In the following decades, pro-slavery Senators co-opted the \nfilibuster to protect the interests of White southern enslavers. Men \nsuch as John Calhoun abused the filibuster to obstruct civil right \nefforts.\n  And according to historians, between 1917 and 1994, 30 measures \nfavored by the sitting President and simple majorities in the House and \nSenate--half of which addressed civil rights--they all died, thanks to \nthe filibuster.\n  The same procedural tool proved to be even more useful to southern \nSenators who sought to block civil rights legislation, including \nantilynching bills. Not until 1964 did the Senate successfully overcome \na filibuster to pass important civil rights legislation and subsequent \nvoting rights legislation.\n  Now, history should act as a teacher to all of us, and history will \nremind us who voted today on the side of the people. I am proud that \nthis effort includes my Native American Voting Rights Act, which will \nensure Tribes and Native Americans and Alaskan Natives and voters on \nTribal lands will have equal access to the electoral process. Access to \nthe ballot box is the cornerstone of our democratic system, and without \nequitable access to it, we cannot stand on the world stage and claim \nthat we are all leaders in the fight for liberty and justice for all.\n  Now, my Republican colleagues have proven time and again that they \nare not interested in acting on this issue. Washington Republicans have \nmade the political calculation that they have a partisan advantage \nhere. They are too comfortable shrugging their shoulders and sitting on \nthe sidelines while States chip away at the right to vote.\n  I know where I stand. All we are asking for today is the opportunity \nto vote on this critical piece of legislation after everyone here has \nsaid their piece.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing today, to do right by our \ndemocracy, and to send the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Ms. ROSEN. Our democracy is extraordinary because it is built on the \nbedrock idea that, through free and fair elections, the citizens who \nmake up this great country, well, they have a voice, that each person's \nvote truly matters, and in America the people have the power.\n  But at this moment, our democracy is threatened. Republican State \nlegislatures and Governors all over the country are writing laws \ndesigned to restrict the right to vote, to make it harder for tens of \nmillions of eligible citizens to cast their ballots, and silence the \nAmerican people's voice in the process.\n  Make no mistake, this is an unprecedented, coordinated attack to make \nvoting harder for eligible citizens and make it easier for bad actors \nto sabotage our future elections.\n  In my State of Nevada, we have bucked that trend when it comes to \nvoting rights. We have strengthened the right to vote, providing easier \naccess to the ballot box for eligible voters while ensuring fair \nelections.\n  These measures that Governor Steve Sisolak signed into law include \nestablishing a permanent vote-by-mail system, expanding the early \nvoting period, and making it more convenient to register and to vote. \nBut while Nevada has moved forward to protect and strengthen voting \nrights, we are not immune from the attempts to sabotage it.\n  In Nevada, the leading Republican candidate for our secretary of \nstate stated that he would have refused--I repeat, would have refused--\nto certify President Biden's victory in our State, even though the \nresults were certified by a Republican secretary of state and \nunanimously upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court. That same candidate \nopened the door to certifying alternate--alternate--electors in future \nPresidential elections in Nevada, contrary to the actual election \nresults.\n  And in Nevada, the leading Republican candidates for Governor are \npromising to undo our progress and make it harder for Nevadans to vote \nbecause they refused to accept the results of the 2020 election.\n\n  They are pushing the former President's false conspiracy theories \nthat fueled the January 6 insurrection. Attacks like these are a \ngrowing threat to democracy and exactly--exactly--the reason we need to \nact urgently. If we fail to do so--if we fail to do so here and now--\nnew State laws will result in hours-long lines at the polls, overturned \nelection results, and masses of disenfranchised voters.\n  So let's talk about solutions--smart solutions, solutions that give \nevery eligible voter equal access to the ballot box.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act combined with the John Lewis Voting Right \nAdvancement Act meets this moment. It meets the moment we are in with \nour\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\ndemocracy in crisis. It delivers real, meaningful action.\n  First, this bill makes it easy for people to register to vote. It \ndoes this by requiring States to allow eligible Americans to register \nonline and on election day, as well as update our automatic voter \nregistration system.\n  This bill would also require States to accurately maintain their \nvoter registration list and protect voters against unwarranted purges \nfrom the voter rolls. This way, those who should be eligible to vote \ncan do so without hassle or harassment.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act gives Americans more choices on when and how \nthey can legally vote through national standards for early in-person \nvoting, expanded mail-in voting, and finally, making election day a \nnational holiday, because even if you are a hard-working American who \nis busy working long hours or looking after your children or caring for \na sick relative, you should still have access to the ballot box.\n  This bill would ensure election security and prevent partisan \nsabotage by requiring postelection audits and enhancing--enhancing--\nprotections for election records.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act would also take long-needed steps to end \npolitical corruption in our elections. It would accomplish this by \nprotecting U.S. elections from foreign interference, by prohibiting \nfalse information designed to dissuade eligible voters, by promoting \nonline ad transparency, and by putting an end--an end--to that dark \nmoney in our elections.\n  To borrow a few words from the late Congressman John Lewis, my former \ncolleague from the House, a legendary civil rights leader and American \nhero for whom this bill is named, an inspiration to us all and to \npeople all around the world, John Lewis said: ``The right to vote is \nthe most powerful . . . tool . . . in a democracy.''\n  I'm going to repeat those words from John Lewis. Listen closely: \n``The right to vote is the most powerful . . . tool . . . in a \ndemocracy.''\n  Each person's vote is their voice. It is every citizen's opportunity \nto weigh in on what matters most to them, for their family, for their \ncommunity, for the country, for the world. It matters. It is \nfundamental to our democracy, to the very definition of what it means \nto be an American citizen for each and every one of us to stand up, to \nstand tall, to get to the ballot box, to be able to vote the way we \nchoose and have the assurance that our vote is counted. It matters. \nEach person matters.\n  And so if the Senate cannot move forward on this critically important \nlegislation under the status quo, then it is time to reform the rules, \nto restore the Senate, to pass this legislation--because only then can \nwe protect our democracy's future and secure the freedom to vote for \nevery eligible American, for this generation and for the generations to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the \nDemocrats' Federal election takeover. The President just gave one of \nhis rare press conferences. It was only the second one he actually gave \non American soil.\n  The White House seems to think that the cure for Joe Biden's poll \nnumbers is more communications from Joe Biden. And the press conference \nwent on for 1 hour and 54 minutes.\n  The White House doesn't have a communications problem. It has an \nagenda problem. The American people understand exactly what President \nBiden and Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi are trying to sell. The \nAmerican people aren't buying it.\n  Democrats don't need a message reset. They need a better agenda for \nthe Nation. What we are about to vote on tonight has nothing to do with \nthe priorities of the American people. It has nothing to do with \ncoronavirus. It has nothing to do with 40-year high inflation numbers \nwhich are biting into the paychecks of the American people. It has \nnothing to do with the crisis at the southern border, where 2 million \nillegal immigrants have crossed the border this year--criminals among \nthem, drug smugglers among them, gang members among them. It has \nnothing to do with what has driven the President's approval numbers to \nan all-time low of 40 percent, which it is today in the Gallup poll.\n  The Democrats' No. 1 goal, which they stated at the beginning of the \nCongress, is to pass a Federal takeover of elections. An election \ntakeover bill was the first bill they introduced.\n  Democrats are ignoring what the American people are demanding so that \nthey can do what their radical fringe is demanding. Democrats want \nelections to be run by Washington, DC, instead of the 50 States.\n  The Constitution is very clear. It says the States run our elections. \nWell, why do they want to take over our elections?\n  Well, Democrats want to do things like banning voter ID laws. Now 80 \npercent of Americans believe people should have to show a photo ID in \norder to vote.\n  Senator Schumer has already twice tried to cram an election takeover \nbill down the throats of the American public. This is the third time. \nAnd, so far, he has failed.\n  So why? Why has this continued to fail? Not simply because \nRepublicans oppose it. It has failed because the American people oppose \nit.\n  The American people aren't looking for a Federal Government takeover \nof elections. A recent Gallup poll asked people what they think is the \nmost important issue facing our country. Voting laws didn't crack the \ntop 20. In fact, voting laws received less than 1 percent of the vote. \nIt was an asterisk in the results.\n\n  Democrats' scare tactics on voting laws have utterly failed. Now \nDemocrats are so desperate to change our voting laws to their advantage \nthat they are going to try to break the Senate. That is what they are \ndoing now. The Senate is supposed to be ``the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.'' Some Democrats want deliberations to end forever.\n  Democrats claim they will change our election laws and then they will \nstop; one time only; claim they will only rig the game just once. Well, \nwe all know that is not true. If they can't resist the temptation to \nrig the U.S. Senate once, they won't resist the temptation to rig the \nrest of the government either.\n  Once Democrats change the rules, there will be no stopping them from \ndoing everything they have ever dreamed: pack the Supreme Court, add \nnew States to the Union, amnesty for illegal immigrants, try to take \naway rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment--you name it. If they \ncan do it, sooner or later, they will.\n  There is a bill in the Senate right now to add four new Justices to \nthe Supreme Court. Forty-six Democrats in the Senate have signed on to \na bill for statehood for the District of Columbia. It is almost the \nentire Democrat caucus. Democrats have also introduced a bill to give \nstatehood to Puerto Rico. If these bills become law, Democrats know \nthey will get four more Democrat Senators permanently.\n  One change to the Senate rules, and America would have a permanent \none-party rule. Don't take my word for it on amnesty either. Just \nmonths ago, Democrats tried to pass amnesty for 6.5 million illegal \nimmigrants. That is greater than the population of 32 of our 50 States. \nAmnesty of this magnitude would permanently remake our electorate. New \nYork City has already granted the right to vote to illegal immigrants. \nIf Democrats break the rules of the Senate in order to change the \nrules, they will pass amnesty as fast as they can.\n  Over the past year, they have gone on record. They have sponsored the \nbills. Yet they know they have failed to persuade the American public \nto support this agenda. They know they will never have bipartisan \nsupport to pass the radical amnesty for illegal immigrants; never have \nbipartisan support to ban voter identification; never have bipartisan \nsupport for taxes and punishing regulations that continue to drive up \nthe cost of energy; never persuade the American people to support their \nradical, extreme, dangerous, and scary agenda. Yet, rather than change \nthe agenda to comply with what the American people want, the Democrats \nwant to change the rules. So, desperate for this radical agenda, they \nare willing to destroy the Senate.\n  Democrats have a long list of partisan bills they would like to pass. \nAll\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nof these bills have two things in common: They have nothing to do with \nimproving the lives of the American people, as the American people see \nit today, and they give more power to the Democrat politicians in \nWashington, DC.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that there is an election in November. In \nthe last election cycle, seven Democrats ran for President saying they \nwould change the rules of the Senate. They all lost. Democrats who said \nthey would change the rules lost key Senate races in swing States, \nincluding Montana, Maine, and Kentucky.\n  The American people have spoken loud and clear. They don't want to \nsee this Democrat power grab. American people want us to focus on their \npriorities. It is up to them to tell us what is important to them, and \nwhat we are hearing loud and clear from the American public, it is \ncoronavirus, it is inflation, it is national security, it is crime, and \nit is securing the border--not a bigger power grab for politicians.\n  The Democrats in this body seem to have forgotten the people they \nwere elected to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President and colleagues, as today's debate begins to \nwind down, I want to rise to join those who have called for the passage \nof the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement \nAct.\n  Years ago, when the United States was in the early stages of conflict \nin Vietnam, I was fortunate to win a Navy ROTC scholarship to attend \nOhio State.\n  During my freshman year there, as spring break approached, our \ncommanding officer urged a bunch of us freshman midshipmen to--he said: \nI got a deal for you. How would you like an all-expenses-paid trip to \nQuantico, VA, over spring break?\n  That is where the marine officers trained after going to college.\n  We all raised our hands and said: Count us in.\n  On our way--1 day off--we had 5 days in Quantico and 1 day off. We \ntook a train to Union Station in Washington, DC, just three or four \nblocks from here, and from there, most of my fellow midshipmen found \ntheir way to watering holes in Georgetown. I chose to visit Capitol \nHill. It is a place I had never been.\n  That day, I walked up Delaware Avenue and passed this building, \nsomehow finding my way into the Rayburn House Office Building just a \nshort distance from where we are gathered today. I walked up to a \nsecurity officer there and asked if there were any hearings underway \nthat I might try to sit in on. He said yep, and he directed me to a \nlong line leading to the House Judiciary Committee room.\n  After a long wait, I finally had the chance to find a seat and watch \nin person the debate over what would later become the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965. I was glued to that seat for hours, mesmerized by what I saw \nand what I heard.\n  Later, back on the train to Quantico that evening, my friends asked \nme what I had found on Capitol Hill on that day, and I told them I \nthought I may have found my future. As it turned out, I did.\n  That day and in the days to come, those hearings inspired by the \ncivil rights movement forced a spotlight on the discriminatory State \nlaws that had made it nearly impossible for many Black Americans to \nvote 100 years after the end of the Civil War.\n  Years earlier, my sister and I had grown up in Danville, VA, the last \ncapital of the Confederacy. There, we saw racial discrimination up \nclose and personal. Even as children, we knew it was wrong, and we knew \nit had to change.\n  Sitting in Rayburn years later, I found the place where I thought \njust maybe--just maybe--I might be able to help do something to right \nthat wrong.\n  Nearly 18 years later, since sitting in that hearing room, after I \nhad finished my studies and completed my third deployment to Southeast \nAsia as a naval flight officer during the Vietnam war, I found myself \nback on Capitol Hill in these halls, this time serving alongside John \nLewis in the House of Representatives.\n  After years of blatant discrimination and voter suppression \nspecifically targeted at Black Americans, we began to witness change. \nIt came slowly at first and then more quickly.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of people like our friend John Lewis, \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 gained increasingly popular bipartisan \nsupport over the years. In fact, as we heard earlier, by 2006, the vote \nto extend the Voting Rights Act was unanimous. Imagine that--98 to 0. \nThink about it--98 to 0. Today, 16 of the Republican colleagues who \nvoted for it among those 98 are still here--are still here.\n  Given that history, however, it is almost unbelievable to think that \nthe right to vote is under attack once again in many parts of our \ncountry. Today, in States across America, State legislators and some \nGovernors are seeking to enact a wave of voter restrictions, many of \nthem with the sole purpose of making it harder to vote, often \nspecifically targeting Black Americans.\n  In 2021 alone, 19 States passed some 34 laws restricting the right to \nvote. How? Well, by allowing partisan observers to intimidate \nindependent poll workers in Texas and by pulling drop boxes and ballot \napplications out of the hands of voters and imposing penalties for poll \nworkers in Florida who were just trying to do their jobs. In Georgia, \nit is OK to make the poll lines longer and longer, but you can't bring \nfood or water to the voters who wait in them, sometimes for hours, to \nvote--hours.\n  We know that in many parts of America, Black voters have to wait in \nline for twice as long as White voters to cast their ballots--twice as \nlong--and in some places, for up to 6 hours. That is not just morally \nwrong, it is an assault on who we are as a people. How can we look at \nwhat is happening and not ask, for God's sake, can't we do better than \nthis? Indeed, we must.\n  Let me leave you with one idea that worked in 1965 and just might \nwork again in 2022. You know, every day across our country, Americans \ngather in places of worship. Every major religion in the world relies \non one common principle that bolsters our connection to each other: the \nGolden Rule; the idea that we should love our neighbor as ourselves; \nthe idea that we ought to treat people the way we want to be treated.\n  Most Americans would be surprised to learn that that admonition is \nrepeated almost weekly in multiple Bible studies and prayer breakfasts \nthat are regularly held here on Capitol Hill throughout the year. It is \na shared belief across religious, ethnic, and party lines that the \nperson across from us is just as valuable as us, just as deserving of \nlove and dedication as we are and our loved ones are.\n  In 1965, the Golden Rule was a foundational principle for equality in \nthe Voting Rights Act. Congress was guided by it. In fact, every major \nreligion on this planet embraces it. I don't care if you are a \nProtestant, Catholic, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and it goes on, the \nGolden Rule is in your teachings, in your beliefs.\n  You hear it here in this body, in this building, week in and week \nout. Maybe, just maybe, it is about time for us to rely on it once \nagain in this land of the free as we seek to connect our values and our \nfaith to our actions.\n  Most of us will recall that both Dr. King and the preamble of our \nConstitution called on us to work to make this a more perfect Union and \nfulfill the promise of our Founders that all men and women are created \nequal.\n  While across our country today, we are seeing a growing wave of voter \nrestrictions, I am reminded of what Martin Luther King said many years \nago. He said this:\n\n       Only when it is dark enough can we see the stars.\n\n  Think about it. Only when it is dark enough can we see the stars. And \nsometimes it is only when we are tested as a nation that our true \nspirit shows itself. I pray--I pray--that this is just one such time.\n  So while none of us hoped we would ever face these challenges in our \ndemocracy to our democracy in the year 2022, perhaps we can take some \ncomfort in knowing that someone else has walked this path before us.\n  All these years later, we feel that ``fierce urgency of now,'' that \n``fierce urgency of now'' that Dr. King spoke of five decades before, \nproviding us with both a moral blueprint and the encouragement to do \nsomething with it.\n  As I close, let me just say, having said all that, let me reiterate \nthat this\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nis not a time to wait and dawdle. Congress needs to regroup when we \nleave this building this day, this week, and then act with the same \nsense of urgency as an earlier Congress did in 1965 and pass the \nFreedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in \norder to better protect the sacred right to vote and uphold the \nsanctity of our electoral processes. The legislation before us today \nseeks to make clear what we as a nation aspire to be. It makes clear \nthat no one who is eligible should be denied the sacred right to vote.\n  Let me close, colleagues, by observing that in the end, we can quote \nDr. King and praise my friend John Lewis until the cows come home, but \nwhen Americans' sacred right to vote is on the line, it is our \nresponsibility to uphold our oath to the Constitution and get on with \nit.\n  I never knew Dr. King. I knew John Lewis, knew him well, and loved \nhim. But I don't know if Dr. King or John Lewis were fans of Mark \nTwain. I am. I want to close by paraphrasing the words of Mark Twain, \nand this is that paraphrase: When in doubt, do what is right. You will \namaze your friends and confound your enemies.\n  Well, friends, time has come to do just that, to do both of those \nthings, and that is why no barrier should stand in the way of our \nsacred obligation to protect this democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (The PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the current voting rights proposals or so-\ncalled voting rights proposals that the Democrats are proposing are not \nabout increasing access to the ballot box. According to the Washington \nPost, the 2020 election saw the highest voter turnout in 120 years, and \n94 percent of the voters said that voting was easy. These bills are \nreally a power grab that would circumvent and federalize our entire \nelections process, stripping States of their constitutional \nauthorities.\n  These power grabs would force taxpayers to pay for political \ncampaigns, expand the practice of ballot harvesting, prohibit important \nvoter ID laws, keep deceased people and those who have moved out of the \narea on voter registration rolls, and federalize election laws, which \nwould violate the U.S. Constitution's clear directive that States \nadminister the elections, to name just a few.\n  Article I, section 4 of the U.S. Constitution delegates the election \nprocesses to the States. This is a Union of 50 States. States are the \nbest equipped to implement and enforce election policies that protect \nthe integrity of all future elections.\n  Although many who have spoken today would have you believe that \nStates across this Nation are seeking to violate the rights of American \ncitizens and restrict their access to voting, the laws that are being \nproposed and adopted by the States are doing just the opposite. They \nare helping to expand voter access and improve security at the polls.\n  There are a lot of myths and untruths running rampant because the \nDemocrats seem to want the public to think there is this widespread \nvoter suppression in Republican-led States, which there is not.\n  A couple of myths and the facts:\n  Myth: Republican State legislatures are enacting laws that will roll \nback early voting.\n  The fact is that the States are expanding early voting. Georgia's \nbill, for example, which has been attacked, allows for and provides \nfor--mandates 17 days of early voting with two additional optional \nSundays of early voting. The list goes on. Arizona allows 26 days. Iowa \nallows 20 days. Texas, another State that has been attacked, allows 17 \ndays. The fact is the States are expanding early voting.\n  Myth: States are implementing voter ID for vote-by-mail in order to \ndisenfranchise voters.\n  The fact: As vote-by-mail is increasing in the States, the States are \nimplementing some of the same safeguards--the same safeguards--that are \nused for in-person voting to ensure a secure election, such as voter \nID, which the legislation before us seems to want to prohibit. Recent \npolls show that 80 percent of the people support being required to show \nID in order to vote, including 62 percent of Democrats.\n  Myth: Prohibiting ballot harvesting and requiring people to vote in \ntheir own correct precinct constitutes discrimination outlawed by the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Fact: In a recent Supreme Court case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 against \nthis claim. Arizona law mandates that voters must vote in their \nassigned precinct, and those who vote early by mail cannot have anyone \nother than a household member, a family member, a caregiver, a postal \nworker, or an elections official collect their ballot; in other words, \nsupervised ballot collection. This law effectively bans the practice of \nballot harvesting.\n  The Democrats seem to want to expand, even mandate, ballot harvesting \nin the legislation we are being asked to support tonight.\n  Myth: States are improperly purging eligible voters from their voter \nrolls.\n  Fact: States are taking reasonable measures to ensure their voter \nrolls are accurate, which makes elections more efficient and fair. \nStates are simply implementing a time-honored practice of cleaning up \nvoter lists, removing voters who have died or who have moved or who \nhave been declared incompetent by a court or convicted of a felony, a \ntime-honored practice in many of the States across this Nation.\n  Myth: Recent changes in Georgia to prevent people from giving bottles \nof water is inhumane and targets minority communities.\n  Fact: The law allows poll workers to set up self-serve water stations \nfor voters to use. The statute prevents political organizations--\npolitical organizations--from giving people in line things like meals, \nwater, or gifts. Once again, this is a longtime honored practice in \nStates. This law of anti-electioneering or anti-vote-buying is standard \npractice in many States, including many of my colleagues' blue States \nlike New York, New Jersey, and President Biden's home State of \nDelaware.\n  So let's get on to the filibuster. The argument is, since the \nRepublicans won't accept these long, directed, so-called reforms of our \nelection laws, that we should eliminate the filibuster in the Senate. \nThat is the last thing that should be done in the Senate. President \nBiden himself has argued against eliminating the filibuster, and \naccording to a recent report, Democrats used that filibuster over 300 \ntimes in 2020.\n  In 2005, then-Senator Joe Biden gave a passionate floor speech \ndefending the Senate filibuster, saying that this is a key procedural \ntool and ending it would ``eviscerate the Senate'' and do a \n``disservice to the country'' and would ``upset the constitutional \ndesign.''\n\n  In another floor speech, then-Senator Biden further argued the reason \nRepublicans in Congress were attempting to end the filibuster was \nbecause they controlled ``every level of government.'' He went on to \npoint out that the reason to have the filibuster rule was so that \n``when one party controls all levers of government, one man or [one] \nwoman can stand on the floor of the Senate and resist the passions of \nthe moment.''\n  Again, in 2005, Senator Chuck Schumer also said that eliminating the \nfilibuster would be a ``doomsday for democracy'' that would turn our \ncountry into, in his words, a ``banana republic.''\n  Former Senator Robert Byrd wrote about preserving the filibuster. We \nheard it many times today. He said:\n\n       We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary \n     fence--this nation has against the excesses of the Executive \n     Branch and the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The Senate has been the last fortress of minority rights \n     and freedom of speech in this Republic for more than two \n     centuries. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before \n     ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the political \n     priority of the moment.\n\n  As Leader McConnell quoted on the floor yesterday, ``[T]he smallest \nmajority we have ever seen in our politics is trying to change the \nrules for how people get elected in every State.''\n  You may recall, Republicans were asked to do this exact thing when we \ncontrolled every lever of government, and we refused to make that \nchange because of the importance of the filibuster to this institution. \nEliminating or weakening the legislative filibuster would destroy the \nintentional design of the Senate to be the world's most deliberative \nbody. It would allow any\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\nsmall majority in the Senate to strip the voice of millions of \nAmericans considered in the minority.\n  Removing the ability to filibuster legislation would reduce the \nincentive for the Senate to forge broad agreements and force further \ndebate and would likely increase divisiveness rather than efficiency.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this Federal takeover of our \nState's constitutional right to manage their own elections, and I urge \nmy colleagues to reject this unfounded assault on the Senate \nfilibuster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has been an interesting day of debate. \nIt actually feels good to hear people really speak on an issue. As \nPresident pro tempore, I sat in that chair where my distinguished \nfriend from Maine is sitting now as Presiding Officer. I sat there for \nhours today and listened to the debate and heard many I found extremely \ngood and then I heard some others. But I appreciate the fact that I had \nthe opportunity, as President pro tempore, to hear so many of the \nSenators of both parties speak.\n  You know, I spoke yesterday about protecting everyone's vote on the \nballot and how important that is. I know that because in my own State \nof Vermont, when I first ran, it was a very Republican State. I have \nbeen on the ballot, between my time as State's attorney and Senator, \nbetween primaries and general elections--I have been on the ballot in \nVermont 24 times. I never questioned that the ballots would be counted \naccurately and honestly, even though, in several of the elections, 80 \nto 90 percent of the people counting the ballots were the town clerks, \nand they were Republicans.\n  So after those 24 times, I think I have some idea of how the Senate \nworks, and I can also say that with seniority comes a bit of \nexperience. This is my 48th year here in the U.S. Senate, having been \nelected by those same Vermonters whom I praise for the way they \nprotected the sanctity of the ballot 48 times. I am still the only \nDemocrat sent to the U.S. Senate by the voters of Vermont.\n  I have become the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nformer chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary and Agriculture \nCommittees, and then honored three times to be elected as President pro \ntempore. So let me just take a couple minutes of your indulgence to \ntalk about what the Senate was, what it has become, and what it can be \nagain.\n  I think my experience qualifies me to say that. My conscience compels \nme to say that. We, each of us, stand on the shoulders of giants. The \nSenators from across the political spectrum and from around this Nation \nwho forged a path for America, they met the moment of the time not with \ntimidity or fear but with action and with decisiveness. Now, was the \nroad taken an easy one? No. Was the struggle short? No. But was it \nworth the sacrifice, the dedication, the commitment, and, yes, the \ncompromise, to meet it? Of course.\n  But before the Senate today is the issue that is at the heart of our \nvery government, the right to vote--the one thing we can hold sacred, \nno matter what party we belong to, the right to vote.\n  Time and time again, the Constitution has been amended to expand the \nright to vote, not to restrict it but to expand it. Look at the 15th \nAmendment, the 19th, the 24th, the 26th. These each gave greater access \nto the ballot box for Americans; it furthered the shared goals that \nours be the most inclusive and most democratic Nation on Earth.\n  But today, we do have a scourge of laws--no matter what we say on the \nfloor, the facts are we have a scourge of laws making their way through \npartisan legislatures across the country. They roll back the tides of \ntime, ruining the most fundamental right, all at a time when technology \nand pure common sense should tell us that voting should be a lot more \naccessible than it is and coupled with a challenge from the Supreme \nCourt that the Congress affirmatively act. Remember, the Supreme Court \nsaid why doesn't Congress step in and act to restore the long \nbipartisan Voting Rights Act. There is no more important time than now \nfor us to meaningfully address this constitutional right, this \nfoundational right.\n  Now, there are some honest questions to ask here of ourselves and \neach other. Do we really want to make it more difficult for Americans \nto vote legally and safely?\n  Is that what democracy means to you, to me? Do we really want to \nallow States to make it more difficult for blue-collar workers or the \npoor or the disadvantaged to vote, when the great advances of time and \ntechnology are there where you can easily make it easier--easier--to \nvote, not more difficult.\n  Are we really going to turn back the clock to an era where State and \nlocal jurisdictions can blatantly discriminate against certain voters--\nyes, people of color and minority populations--by simply rigging the \nsystems of voting or counting or changing the map, to erase the \nprogress of generations and make meaningless the fight of lions like \nJohn Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and so many others? Is that \nreally what we stand for in this century? Were we elected by our \nconstituents to flatly obstruct any action in this body simply because \nour party is not in the majority or were we elected to tacitly agree \nwith a prescribed agenda? The Senate and those who stand in it owe more \nto our constituents and to this Nation than blind party loyalty. We owe \nit to the Nation to do what is right. We owe it to our conscience to do \nwhat is right. Partisan disagreements, divisions, and stalemates dot \nthe pages of our young Nation's history when you go back and read it, \nbut it is the moments of bipartisanship that punctuate it.\n\n  So I would ask a question of our two leaders.\n  Mr. Majority Leader, should we not have a debate, a real debate, on \nthese issues, with amendments, unbound by deadlines or time limits?\n  In answer to that, I also ask of the minority leader: Do we not have \nan obligation to Americans, to your constituents and mine, to at least \ntalk about these issues, offer honest and meaningful proposals, and \nthen vote them up or vote them down?\n  Are we not intended to be the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld? It probably was when I came here, but these days, we surely are \nnot.\n  History will remember this moment--a moment when we stood for the \nfoundational right of our democracy--the right to vote--or we stood \nagainst it. Long have I said on this floor that the conscience of the \nNation rests in the U.S. Senate--or it should. Today, we--each of us \nwho has sworn to uphold the Constitution as a Member of this great \nbody--must examine our own conscience. We must decide whether it will \nbe the politics of exclusion or the justice of inclusion that will be \nthe indelible mark of the 117th Congress, and we must decide if the \nSenate envisioned by our Founders can be restored.\n  The giants, the lions of the Senate, are the Members who rise above \nto meet these moments and who have the courage to do what is right. If \nour jobs were easy, anyone could do them, but throughout history, fewer \nthan 2,000 Americans have had the honor, the privilege, and the \nresponsibility to hold the title of ``U.S. Senator.''\n  I have been proud to serve with one out of every five of those \nSenators--some I agreed with, some I disagreed with. But I can say \nthis: We, the 100 here today, are caretakers of a legacy far greater \nthan our own. We shoulder the responsibility of a nation--a nation \nfounded under the principle that governments are instituted among their \npeople, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n  I fear that, if we let this moment--this pivotal moment--pass us by \nwith no debate, no action, and no advancement, we will not only be \nderelict in our duty, but we will betray the very oath we swore when we \nstood in front of the desk at which the Presiding Officer is sitting \nand pledged to defend the Constitution and to continue the endless goal \nof forming a more perfect Union.\n  We should pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, but we should \nat the very least have the courage to debate it.\n  I feel such privilege in serving Vermont. I feel such privilege to \nhave been on the ballot 24 times in our State because I can always \ntrust that everybody who wanted to vote could.\n  Today, we have the technology and the ability to have far more people\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nvote. Don't we owe it to this country and don't we owe it to our oath \nof office to do that?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Another Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are running out of Senators from \nVermont. I think that is it.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Let me begin by thanking a number of my Senate colleagues who have \nworked so hard on this issue. Let me thank, among others, Senators \nMerkley, Klobuchar, Booker, Warner, King, Leahy, Durbin, Kaine, and \nothers for their efforts on this important issue.\n  I will be brief because there is not a whole lot that I can add to \nthe excellent statements that so many other Senators have made. Let me \njust say this: For some, the issue we are debating today may seem \ncomplicated, to be understood only by lawyers, constitutional scholars, \nand those handfuls of people who actually understand the opaque rules \nof the U.S. Senate. I just want to say that, if this is what you think, \nyou are wrong. What we are debating today is not complicated; it is \nreally quite simple. Here is what it is about.\n  Joe Biden won the 2020 Presidential election, period. You may have \nliked that result or you may not have liked it, but he won. He won in \nan election that Donald Trump's own Department of Homeland Security \ndetermined to be the most secure election in American history.\n  After the election, Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 \nlawsuits in State and Federal courts, repeating their false claims and \ntrying to reverse the election results. These lawsuits were rejected \ntime and time again, including with judges whom Trump himself \nappointed. Nonetheless, the former President continued to claim--and to \nthis day continues to claim despite all of the evidence--that the \nelection was stolen and that he actually won in a landslide.\n  Not only are his statements and actions delusional, they are worse. \nIn repeating this Big Lie over and over again, he not only cast doubts \nabout the 2020 election, but, in fact, in a disgraceful and \nunprecedented way for a President, he is undermining the very \nfoundations of American democracy.\n\n  Shamefully, Republican leaders all across this country, including \nRepublican Members of the U.S. Senate, either repeated Trump's lies or \ntried to walk a very, very thin line around them. Trump's one-man \ndominance over the Republican Party is now so strong that few \nRepublican officials are prepared to state openly what they know in \ntheir hearts to be true, and that is that Trump is a pathological liar \nand a threat to democracy and this country and our very way of life.\n  In any case, the predictable result of all of this was that \nRepublican Governors and legislatures all over this country saw Trump's \nBig Lie and fearmongering as an opportunity--a golden opportunity--to \nsolidify their political positions.\n  Acting under the guise of voter integrity, despite the fact that our \nNation has very little voter fraud--thank God--they proceeded to pass \nelection laws in 19 States that make it harder for people to vote, with \na special focus on people of color, young people, poor people, and \npeople with disabilities--people who might be inclined to vote against \nthem. In many cases, they also created election districts through \nextreme gerrymandering that have no rationale other than to make \ncertain that Republicans retain control over State legislatures. In \nother cases, they are cutting back on the authority of independent \nelection officials and giving that power to partisan legislatures.\n  Today, in order to address this crisis in American democracy, Members \nof the Senate will be casting two very important votes.\n  The first will be on the Freedom to Vote Act. This bill goes a long \nway to ending voter suppression and, in fact, making it easier, not \nharder, for American citizens to vote. It establishes automatic voter \nregistration and online voter registration. It celebrates democracy by \nmaking election day a national holiday so that people can vote at a \ntime other than after work. It establishes uniform early voting and \nsame-day registration.\n  This bill also ends partisan gerrymandering and roots out the undue \ninfluence of special interest money in buying elections. Imagine that. \nImagine that. We would actually know the names of billionaires who put \nhuge amounts of money into super PACs that buy elections. What a \nterrible thing. We would actually know who these people are.\n  This bill would also provide increased protection in the voting \nprocess to voters with disabilities, the military, overseas voters, and \nunderserved communities, and much, much more.\n  This is a very significant piece of legislation. Now, why would \nanybody be opposed to it? Why, in a nation that has a history of \ndenying the vote to African Americans, denying the vote to Native \nAmericans, denying the vote to women, denying the vote to low-income \nWhites, would any fairminded person be in opposition to making it \neasier for all citizens to vote?\n  That is what I understood when I went to elementary school. You know, \nyou play by the rules. You do your best. Sometimes you win, and \nsometimes you lose. That is the process. But no one ever told me that \nwhat politics is about is working overtime to try to prevent people \nfrom voting just because they might vote against you.\n  Our job should be to increase voter turnout and make it easier for \npeople to participate, which is what this legislation does. I want this \ncountry to have the highest voter turnout of any nation's on Earth, not \none of the lowest.\n  But let's be clear. This enormously important bill--a bill to protect \nthe foundations of American democracy--will fail. It will fail because, \naccording to Senate rules, it will require 60 votes to pass, and in a \n50-50 Senate, not one Republican will vote for it. It will likely get \n50 votes, which, with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote, \nwould be enough to pass this legislation under majority rule. It will \nnot get 60 votes--all of which brings us to the second vote, which is \nreally the most important vote of the day.\n  That vote will determine whether anything we discuss today--whether \nany of the speeches that we give, any of the points that we actually \nmake--will, in fact, become law. That is the vote to change Senate \nrules and establish a talking filibuster--a process which gives the \nminority an enormous amount of time to object to legislation and voice \ntheir concerns. The minority, whether it is a Democratic minority or a \nRepublican minority, would have days and days and days to slow the \nprocess down and to rally the American people around their ideas, but \nthey would not have forever. At the end of the time allotted, a \nmajority vote would prevail, which, in my view, is what a democratic \nsociety is all about.\n  Is changing the Senate rules a radical idea? Oh, my God. For the \nfirst time in history, we are about to do it. It has never been done \nbefore--well, really, not quite. No. As every Member of the Senate \nknows, the rules get changed on a fairly regular basis. There is \nnothing radical about it. Just a few months ago, in order to raise the \ndebt ceiling and prevent our government from defaulting on its loans, \nthe rules were changed so that a 50-vote majority would prevail. We \nchanged the rules appropriately, and we prevented a default in a \nmassive worldwide depression.\n\n  Just a few years ago, my Republican colleagues, who are so adamantly \nagainst changing rules, well, my goodness, they changed the Senate \nrules to allow 50 votes to confirm the President's nominees for the \nSupreme Court--oh, my goodness, how shocking--and they got three \nconservative Supreme Court Justices as a result.\n  Rules get changed around here all of the time. And, maybe, just \nmaybe, we might want to change the rules in order to save American \ndemocracy.\n  Now, let me conclude by saying this. And I don't know if any of my \nother colleagues have made this point, but I will. I regard it as a \nvery sad day for our country--and I mean this very sincerely--that not \none Republican in this body is prepared to vote for this bill.\n  Now, I understand why that is the case. I am in politics. I got it. I \nknow who the leader of their party is. But this, I do not understand. I \ncan understand Republicans, but this, I do not understand. I do not \nunderstand why two Democrats, who presumably understand the importance \nof the Freedom\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nto Vote Act--and, as I understand it, will vote for the Freedom to Vote \nAct--are not prepared to change the rules so that that bill could \nactually become law. That, I do not understand.\n  If you think this bill makes sense and if you are worried about the \nfuture of American democracy and if you are prepared to vote for the \nbill, then why are you wasting everybody's time and not voting for the \nrule change that allows us to pass the bill? It is like inviting \nsomebody to lunch, putting out a great spread, and saying you can't \neat. If you are going to vote for the bill, vote to change the rules.\n  If we can change the rules to prevent a default on our national debt, \nif we can change the rules to confirm Supreme Court Justices, we can \ncertainly change the rules to save American democracy.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln must be turning in his \ngrave to hear the Senators from the Grand Old Party--the party of \nabolition and emancipation and reconstruction--echoing the State's \nrights rhetoric of Dixiecrat segregationists to oppose Federal voting \nrights legislation, to oppose even the reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  In 2021, just one Republican Senator had the courage and principle to \nvote to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965--the Senator from Alaska, \nMs. Murkowski--just one.\n  For decades, the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was \nbipartisan. Today, only one Republican Senator will stand up for this \nlandmark achievement of the civil rights movement--not Senator Cornyn \nof Texas, who previously said, ``the Voting Rights Act is simply the \nmost important and most effective civil rights legislation ever passed, \nbar none''--no longer his position--not my friend the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, who previously said, ``This bill will ensure that \nthe voting rights afforded to all Americans are protected''; not \nSenator Burr of North Carolina, who previously said, ``Voting rights \nfor all American citizens regardless of race [are] granted by the 15th \nAmendment and enforced by the Voting Rights Act''; and not the minority \nleader, who previously said, ``This is a good piece of legislation \nwhich has served an important purpose over many years. . . . And this \nlandmark piece of legislation will continue to make a difference not \nonly in the South but for all [Americans] and for all of us, whether we \nare African-Americans or not''; not the minority leader, the same \nminority leader, who said, ``This bill eliminated the barriers to \nvoting so that all Americans could participate in the basic opportunity \neach of us have,'' who celebrated, ``We have . . . renewed the Voting \nRights Act periodically since that time, overwhelmingly, and on a \nbipartisan basis, year after year . . . because members of Congress \nrealize [that] this is a piece of legislation [that] has worked''--no \nmore, not in 2022. Only one Republican Senator stood up to support the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  When Congressman John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Amelia Boynton and \nhundreds of others marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody \nSunday, when John Lewis had his skull fractured on that bridge for \ndaring to demand the right to vote for Black Americans in the American \nSouth, it was the example of their courage and their sacrifice that \npaved the way for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  As my colleague, my brother, Senator Reverend Warnock has often \nobserved, when Congressman Lewis passed, there were many in this \nChamber on both sides who rightly celebrated his towering achievements \nand his legacy. But I speak for the State of Georgia when I say: Do not \ninvoke Congressman Lewis' name to signal your virtue while you work to \nerode his legacy and defy his will.\n  I have heard a lot from our Republican colleagues about the recently \npassed election law in the State of Georgia. Let's be very clear. There \nis no one in Georgia on either side of the aisle who doubts or does not \nunderstand precisely what its purpose is.\n\n  Mr. WARNOCK. That is right. That is right.\n  Mr. OSSOFF. Forbidding voter registration for run-off elections, \ndriving down the early vote period during divisive runoffs to drive up \nlines at majority Black precincts.\n  As he used to say, John Lewis didn't give a little blood on that \nbridge that day so that Black Georgians would have to wait eight times \nlonger to vote than White Georgians. John Lewis didn't give a little \nbit of blood on that bridge that day so that State legislatures across \nthis country could pass legislation surgically targeted to make it \nharder for some people to vote, all for partisan power.\n  In the State of Georgia, where now partisan election officials can \nstep in and throw out locally elected election boards to change who can \nvote and where they can vote--this, in the aftermath of a well-known \nincident when the former President of the United States threatened \nGeorgia's secretary of state with criminal prosecution if he didn't \n``find 11,000 votes'' that were never cast for Donald Trump.\n  The facts of the former President's efforts to seize reelection, \ndespite his defeat, are well-known. He and his lieutenants mounted an \nunprecedented campaign to retain power based on a torrent of lies that \nhave grievously wounded public confidence in our elections. And it was \nonly thanks to the integrity of our laws and our courts and principled \nelection officials and the will of Congress, the will of this Senate, \nto ensure the peaceful transition of power in the face of a violent \nassault on the U.S. Capitol that this conspiracy was defeated.\n  So now, this faction seeks to dismantle precisely those bulwarks \nwhich prevented their onslaught from succeeding. The choice is ours \nwhether we will allow them to do so.\n  We in the U.S. Congress, Madam Vice President, have the \nconstitutional authority to make the laws with respect to the \nadministration of Federal elections.\n  We in the U.S. Senate have an obligation to defend the legacy of \nCongressman John Lewis, to stand up for the sacred franchise, to secure \nequal access to the ballot for every single American voter so that this \ncountry can continue its journey toward full realization of our \nfounding ideals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. WARNOCK. Madam Vice President, we have been summoned here by \nhistory. This is not just another routine day in the Senate. This is a \nmoral moment in America.\n  I recall the words of that great American patriot and prophet, Martin \nLuther King, Jr., whose birthday all of us just observed. As he \nagonized over the difficulty and complexity of that moral moment, Dr. \nKing said: ``History has thrust something upon me from which I cannot \nturn away.'' We have been summoned here, all of us. We cannot turn \naway.\n  This is no time for politics as usual. The times cry out for moral \nleadership, for integrity, for empathy, and for care for one another, \nfor deep investment in the covenant that we have with one another as an \nAmerican people. ``E pluribus unum,'' out of many, one--what a grand \ndoctrine, what a noble idea, which our country has been striving to \nreach with fits and starts with setbacks and comebacks since the day of \nits founding.\n  This is one of those moments. We cannot turn away. We cannot hide \nfrom history. And I am truly honored to stand here with all of you, \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents, in this moment. And on this, \nmy 365th day as a Member of the U.S. Senate, the most consequential \ndeliberative body on the planet, striving, again, for greatness.\n  I was elected from Georgia on January 5--what an honor to represent \nthe people of the State of Georgia and what a great Nation, a kid from \nthe Kayton Homes Housing Projects, the first college graduate in my \nfamily of 12. My folks are both preachers. They read the Scriptures: \n``Be fruitful and multiply.'' But this kid who grew up in poverty is \nnow serving in the U.S. Senate, only the 11th Black Senator in the \nwhole history of our Nation. Also during that same time, Georgia also \nelected its first Jewish Senator, my brother Jon Ossoff.\n\n  I believe that somewhere, in glory, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nRabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel are smiling because they marched together. \nRabbi\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\nHeschel said that when he marched with Dr. King, he felt like his legs \nwere praying.\n  So what a moment. I won after a hard-fought election, and the next \nmorning, I was feeling pretty good. My mother, who grew up in Waycross, \nGA, picking cotton as a teenager, had joined with other Georgians in \nrecord voter turnout, and the 82-year-old hands that used to pick \nsomebody else's cotton helped to pick her youngest son to be a U.S. \nSenator. Only in America is my story even possible.\n  I was on several of the morning shows talking about what the people \nof Georgia had achieved, and I was feeling pretty good that morning. \nMan, I was on ``The View'' talking to Whoopi Goldberg. But by \nlunchtime, the news alerts on my phone began to buzz. Something was \nhappening in the Capitol. And we all know the rest of that sad and \ntragic story: a violent assault on our Nation's Capitol driven by the \nBig Lie, ugly words, signs and symbols of racism and anti-Semitism, an \neffort to stop the legal certification of an election.\n  In spite of those who want to hide, sadly, January 6 really did \nhappen, and we must face up to it. We cannot hide from history. January \n6 happened. But here is the thing: January 5 also happened. Georgia, a \nState in the old Confederacy, sent a Black man and a Jewish man to the \nSenate in one fell swoop.\n  Our Nation has always had a complicated history, and I submit to you \nthat here is where we are. We are swinging from a moral dilemma. We are \ncaught somewhere between January 5 and January 6, between our hopes and \nour fears, between bigotry and beloved community. In each moment, we \nthe people have to decide which way are we going to go and what we are \nwilling to sacrifice in order to get there.\n  The question today is, Are we going to give in to a violent attack \nwhose aim is now being pursued through partisan voter suppression laws \nin State legislatures?\n  Sadly, Georgia, the same Georgia that sent me and my brother, Ossoff, \nto the Senate--not the people of Georgia; partisan State politicians \nhave decided to punish their own citizens for having the audacity to \nshow up.\n  It isn't just about the restrictions around water and food \ndistribution. The more fundamental question is, Why are the lines so \nlong in the first place, and why is that the case in certain \ncommunities?\n  I know that some Americans listening to me right now don't know what \nwe mean because that is not your experience, but it is the experience \nof so many of your fellow Americans. We need empathy, compassion, care \nfor one another.\n  Why are local election officials working in Lincoln County, GA, to \nclose all but one polling location for a county that is bigger than 250 \nsquare miles? Why is the second most powerful legislator in the Georgia \nState Senate working right now to pass legislation to eliminate all \nballot drop boxes in Georgia in the middle of a pandemic? Why are State \nleaders in Georgia right now working to take over the local elections \nboard in Fulton County, where Ebenezer Baptist Church sits?\n  There is a woman in Cobb County named Irish. She says she has tried \nrepeatedly over the past 10 years to vote but could not because of long \nlines and changing polling locations--people playing games. She said \nthat she has often had to decide if she will work or vote.\n  Another woman, Varana, from Cobb County says that she waited in line \nfor 8 hours in the rain at her local library--8 hours--to vote.\n  I run into constituents all the time who tell me that they waited for \nhours to vote for me. I am honored that they voted for me, but I am sad \nthat they should have to wait for 8 hours.\n  A student in Atlanta named Isabella says that she and many of her \nfriends could not vote in the November 2020 election because they did \nnot want to skip class to stand in line.\n  Why are State leaders in Georgia behaving as if giving voters these \nawful choices is normal or that voters like these Georgians don't \nexist?\n  Those are the facts of the laws that are being passed in Georgia and \nacross our Nation.\n  So here is the question tonight: America, are we January 5 or are we \nJanuary 6? Are we going to give in to the forces that seek to divide us \nby gerrymandering us, suppressing us, and subverting the voices of some \nof us in pursuit of power at any cost, or are we going to live up to \nthat grand American covenant ``e pluribus unum''--``out of many, one''? \nI choose what Dr. King called ``beloved community.'' I choose America. \nI choose a nation that embraces all of us.\n  We have been summoned here. We cannot turn away. In just a few \nmoments, all 100 of us, blessed with a sacred trust, will let the \nAmerican people know where we stand on the question of whether the \nSenate will protect their voices, the voices of the very people who \nsent us here, or if we will simply surrender to the anti-democratic \nfervor and polarizing disunity spreading across our Nation.\n\n  In the meantime, let me say that I am glad that we are finally \nactually having a debate on the Senate floor. Imagine that. The \nSenate--what is that?--the most important deliberative body--is \nactually having a debate. It took us nearly a year to get to this \npoint, and I want to thank my colleagues who worked with me and others \nover the last many months to keep this critical issue on the Senate's \nfront burner.\n  Voting rights are preservative of all other rights. The democracy is \nthe framework in which all other debates take place. We can strengthen \nour infrastructure and the infrastructure of our democracy at the same \ntime. If we can change the rules to raise the debt ceiling, we can \nchange the rules to raise and repair the ceiling of our democracy. This \nis our work.\n  So we have crafted a strong piece of compromise legislation that will \naddress the rampant voter suppression and election subversion laws we \nare seeing passed in State after State after State--19 so far and \ncounting. The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act will restore bedrock \nvoting protections established by the Voting Rights Act of 1965--\nprotections that have been eroded by the Supreme Court and are born \nfrom an era where Members of this body used to work together to solve \nthe tough issues of our time. It will also set a Federal baseline for \nvoting standards to ensure every eligible voter has access to the \nballot, no matter where they live, and to protect elections from \nsubversion by craven politicians.\n  Voting rights should be bipartisan; used to be bipartisan; passed \nthis body the last time 98 to 0 and signed into law by George W. Bush, \na Republican President.\n  I know that my colleagues and I have worked in good faith this past \nyear, this entire year. We have worked hard to try to find some common \nground with our Republican friends on this issue.\n  I have said to my colleagues: Let us bring these measures to the \nfloor to debate. Let's reason. Let's deliberate.\n  I had hoped our friends on the other side would have allowed us to \nhave a debate on voting rights legislation, but until today, that is \nwhat they have blocked three times in the Senate. They didn't block the \nbills; they blocked our ability to even have debate on the bills.\n  As a pastor, I understand the power and the possibility of coming \ntogether with those with whom we disagree to have a robust debate on \nthe issues that are important to families and to our country. I share \nwith many of you, I am sure, a vision of the Senate that collaborates \nand negotiates on the most important issues of our time.\n  I believe in bipartisanship, but when it comes to something as \nfundamental as voting rights, I just have to ask: Bipartisanship at \nwhat cost? Who is being asked to foot the bill for this bipartisanship? \nAnd is liberty itself the cost? I submit that that is a cost too high \nand a bridge too far.\n  I am deeply saddened that our Republican colleagues chose not to join \nus in this effort. Democrats would prefer not to act alone, but, by all \nmeans, we have to act. Even if we don't get it done tonight, we have to \nkeep working at it until we get it done.\n  Dr. King's words are as true now as they were back then: ``History \nhas thrust something upon me from which I cannot turn away.'' He said: \n``Justice delayed is justice denied.''\n  Now, I know that I have been speaking a lot over the course of the \nlast\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\nyear about voting rights, and it is one of my--one of my--primary \npassions. But I am thrilled to work for Georgians to close the Medicaid \ncoverage gap in our State; to create new, good-paying jobs in growing \nand emerging industries; to strengthen broadband across our State; and \nmore. I am thrilled to fight for these priorities for Georgia because \nthat is what Georgians sent me here to do, but they sent me with their \nvotes.\n  How can we have productive conversations about the many issues \naffecting the American people--about lowering healthcare costs, about \ncreating good-paying jobs, about fighting climate change, protecting \nreproductive healthcare--if politicians in States get to cherry-pick \ntheir voters and the people's voices are squeezed out of their \ndemocracy? How can we achieve real consensus on the issues that matter \nmost if only some voters can be heard?\n  Taking action to pass voting rights legislation is not a policy \nargument; it is about the democracy itself. Voting rights is how we \naddress the deepening divides in our country, by ensuring every \neligible voter's voice is heard. We, as elected representatives, have \nan obligation to protect their voice.\n  So when it comes to the question of procedure and the filibuster, let \nme be clear: I believe that voting rights are more important than a \nprocedural rule, and if taking action requires a change in the rules, \nthen it is time to change the rules.\n  When the times changed, we have always changed the rules--160 times.\n  And as we consider the filibuster, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert Byrd, inevitably comes up. His is an important \nperspective, but we shouldn't quote him as if he is Scripture. In fact, \nhe didn't always get it right. He said his greatest regret was \nfilibustering the 1964 civil rights bill. Robert Byrd learned from \nhistory. Will we?\n  As I continue on what may feel like a filibuster, some point to \nSenate procedure, while others recycle excuses we heard before. But as \nthe pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, I also know that all of these \narguments against taking the moral action we are called to take are \ndistractions.\n  Consider this. There are some things you can do in this Chamber with \njust 51 votes: confirm a Supreme Court nominee, 51; pass trillions of \ndollars in investments for our communities, 51; pass massive tax cuts, \nmainly for the richest of the rich, 51; confirm Cabinet nominees, 51; \nraise the debt ceiling--we found a way to do it the other week--51. But \nit takes 60 votes to repair the ceiling of our democracy by passing \nvoting rights legislation.\n  I am left to conclude that if the issue is important enough, the \nSenate feels compelled to act. Well, let me say that I believe that the \ndemocracy is at least as important as the economy. Recently, many of \nour colleagues have argued that legislation to protect voting rights \nsomehow offends our Federal system of government and amounts, they say, \nto a Federal takeover of elections.\n  Some of the same voices, ironically, who have extolled Dr. King's \nlife this week have, at the same time, been working vigorously against \nthe legislation we are debating today to protect the right to vote, and \nmany of them have been channeling old States' rights arguments.\n  Let the message go out. You cannot remember Martin Luther King, Jr., \nand dismember his legacy at the same time. You can argue whatever side \nyou want, but you do not get to argue both sides. I will not sit \nquietly while some make Dr. King a victim of identity theft. You do not \nget to offer praises and plaudits in memory of Dr. King and then \nmarshal the same kind of States' rights arguments that were used \nagainst Dr. King and against the civil rights movement.\n  Please know that as the pastor of Dr. King's church, this argument \nevokes, I say really respectfully--it evokes--some of the darkest \nmoments in our country's long struggle for equality.\n  When the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was \nunconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, after a century of Jim \nCrow laws, Arkansas Governor Orval Fabus did not argue that he \nsupported segregation at all costs. He, instead, claimed that obeying \nthe Brown decision amounted to a ``surrender'' of ``all our rights,'' \nhe said, ``as citizens to an all powerful Federal autocracy.''\n  When Senator Strom Thurmond launched the longest filibuster in the \nUnited States, against a bill to protect voting rights, he didn't argue \nexplicitly that Black people didn't deserve to vote. He, instead, \nclaimed that it was ``unlawful and unconstitutional'' for Congress to \nregulate the elections of the States.\n  And during the Senate's 60-day debate on the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, the closing argument of the bill's opponents--led and articulated \nby Georgia Senator Richard B. Russell--was that it would ``strike down \nand destroy many rights and powers which, since the foundation of our \ngovernment have properly belonged to several States.''\n  Let's be very clear about this legislation. The States will continue \nto administer their elections. And, of course, States have certain \nrights. Do we genuinely believe that States have a right to \ndiscriminate, to suppress, or to block access to ballot boxes for so \nmany Americans?\n  Although we are 50 unique States, we are also united as one Republic, \nand what happens in one State can affect us all. When we elect our U.S. \nSenators and our U.S. Representatives, and when we elect the President, \nwe must represent all Americans; we need every vote to count to \nmaintain the integrity of our democracy. And so we must do this work.\n  I support reforming the Electoral Count Act. That said, reforming the \nElectoral Count Act will do virtually nothing to address the sweeping \nvoter suppression and election subversion efforts taking place in \nGeorgia and in States and localities nationwide. It doesn't matter if \nyour votes are properly counted if you cannot cast your vote in the \nfirst place.\n  And so, as I close, I want to appeal to all of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, not just as a colleague but as a pastor and as a \nman of faith. The American people have sent us here, and history has \nsummoned us to this moment. We cannot hide. Whatever the outcome \ntonight, I still believe in us. I believe in the U.S. I believe in us. \nI believe that democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual \nidea, that we are all children of God and therefore we all ought to \nhave a voice in the direction of our country and our destiny within it. \nI believe that a vote is a kind of prayer for the world we desire for \nourselves and for our children and that our prayers are stronger when \nwe pray together.\n  A young Martin Luther King, Jr., struggled all those years ago, and \nhe said: ``History has thrust something upon me from which I cannot \nturn away.'' Those of us who are students of Dr. King--I know I have--\noften wonder: What would I have done if I were alive during the civil \nrights movement? I know we would all like to think that we, too, would \nhave had just a small fraction--just a fraction--of the courage that it \ntook for John Lewis to cross that Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n  Well, for those of us who are fortunate enough to have served in the \nU.S. Senate in this moment--in this moral moment--we do not have to \nwonder. My God, he faced troopers on the other side, crossing that \nbridge. We are talking about a procedural bridge. We don't have to \nwonder what we would have done. I submit that what we would have done \nback then we are doing right now. History is watching us. Our children \nare counting on us. And I hope that we will have the courage to do what \nis right for our communities and for our country, the courage to cross \nthis bridge, to do the hard work in this defining moral moment in \nAmerica for the sake of the communities that sent us here in the first \nplace--for the sake of the planet, for the sake of healthcare, for the \nsake of jobs, for the sake of being able to argue for the things that \nwe care about--the courage to fight for one another.\n  I am still praying that we will cross that bridge, but, if not \ntonight, we will come back again and again and again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam Vice President, I rise today in support of two \nimportant voting rights bills the Senate is now considering, the \nFreedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act would protect access to the ballot by \npermitting\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nall voters to vote by mail, providing a minimum of 15 days of early in-\nperson voting for Federal elections, and allowing same-day voter \nregistration at polling places. The bill would also protect nonpartisan \nelection officials from interference and intimidation and end partisan \ngerrymandering of congressional districts.\n  The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 by allowing the Justice Department to prevent \ndiscriminatory State voting laws from taking effect.\n  The need for Federal legislation to protect the sacred and \nfundamental right to vote is clear. Over the last year, we have \nwitnessed a disturbing increase in efforts by State legislatures across \nthe country to make it harder for eligible voters to access and cast \ntheir ballots.\n  Last year, legislators in 49 States introduced more than 440 bills \nthat would make it harder to vote and easier for improper, partisan \ninterference in our election processes. At least 34 of these \nrestrictive bills have become law in 19 States.\n  For example, one new law in Georgia gives the partisan State election \nboard--composed of members appointed by the majority party of the State \nlegislature--the authority to take over election administration from \nthe existing nonpartisan county boards of elections that have \nhistorically been responsible for conducting elections.\n  Another example is a new law in Iowa that makes it harder for \nAmericans with disabilities to vote by restricting access to absentee \nballots and restricting who is allowed to help voters with disabilities \nreturn their ballots.\n  And across the country in red and blue States alike, State \nlegislators are engaging in partisan gerrymandering, strategically \nredrawing congressional and State legislative maps to prevent some \nvoters from fully participating in the political process by diluting \nthe power of their votes.\n  This partisan gerrymandering, in effect, allows elected officials to \nchoose their voters rather than allowing voters to choose their elected \nofficials. This allows one party to design maps that give it a \ndisproportionate edge in State legislatures and delegations in the \nHouse of Representatives. It also has an outsized impact on minority \ncommunities, who all too often see their votes diluted when maps are \ndrawn to minimize their voting clout.\n  The right to vote is a cornerstone of our democracy, enshrined in our \nConstitution. And the Constitution also makes clear that it is the duty \nof Congress to ensure that the fundamental right to vote is protected.\n  Sadly, this legislation has become a partisan issue, even though \nvoting rights has traditionally passed the Senate by a strong \nbipartisan majority and been signed into law by Presidents of both \nparties. In today's Senate, it has become all too easy for either party \nto block action on important legislation. Blocking debate or preventing \nvotes is as easy as denying requests for unanimous consent; Senators \ndon't even have to enter into debate or explain their opposition to a \nmeasure.\n  Having been in the Senate since 1992 and seen important legislation \npass this body, I have resisted calls to change the Senate rules and to \nlimit the rights of the minority. But the Senate filibuster, which was \nintended to be a tool to promote bipartisanship, has become a tool to \nstop almost any major legislation.\n  When Americans thinks about the filibuster, many recall the image of \nJimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' speaking on the \nSenate floor, actively debating a piece of legislation and explaining \ntheir support or opposition. It is time that we return to that \ntradition of debate and not use the filibuster to prevent us from even \ntalking about a bill.\n  If my Republican colleagues want to block this voting rights \nlegislation, I believe they should have to stand on the Senate floor \nand explain to the American people why that is the case, even as the \nright to vote is under attack in statehouses across the country.\n  As representatives of the American people, we should be fighting to \nprotect the fundamental right to vote, not standing in the way of it. \nIt should never be a legislator's goal to make it harder for eligible \nvoters to cast their ballots.\n  We cannot wait any longer. It is time for Congress to do the job the \nConstitution gave us: To ensure that the right to vote is protected.\n  Mr. REED. Madam Vice President, the right to vote is sacred, the \nheart of any democracy. And in a proud, though painful tradition, \nsuccessive generations of Americans have fought to expand and protect \nthat right and ensure that we as a country live up to our democratic \nideals. Many risked their safety and even gave their lives in the fight \nfor the right to vote. From Frederick Douglass to Lucy Burns, from Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., to John Lewis, and countless other unnamed and \nunknown patriots, Americans have long taken it upon themselves to make \ntheir Union more perfect.\n  It is because of the sacrifice and unyielding activism of those brave \nAmericans that the 14th, 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th Amendments \nwere ratified; the Indian Citizenship Act was passed; the Chinese \nExclusion Act was repealed; and in 1965, the landmark legislation of \nthe Voting Rights Act was enacted. That transformative law, along with \nits bipartisan renewals over the following decades, helped set us on a \npath to representation across the Nation that better reflected the \ndiversity of the American people and better ensured the right to vote.\n  We cannot allow these hard-earned advances to be reversed.\n  Yet, as we speak, instead of preserving the right to vote, \nRepublicans are finding new and insidious ways to make it harder to \ncast ballots. Why else would they oppose secure, effective, verifiable \nmail-in ballots? What other reason is there for curtailing early voting \nand weekend voting? These regressive new laws sprouting up across the \ncountry are clearly meant to discourage voters, particularly people of \ncolor, young people, people with disabilities, and the working class. \nThat is not just malicious; it is an assault on America's ideals.\n  In this moment of crisis, only Congress can step in to repair the \nbreach by passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. We cannot \nwait for others to act. Chief Justice Roberts ruled that Congress needs \nto change the Voting Rights Act to preserve its protections for \nmillions of Americans.\n  At the State level, at least 19 States passed laws restricting access \nto voting in 2021, and a number of States have begun to allow partisan \nactors to interfere with election processes or even reject election \nresults entirely. Blatant gerrymandering is diluting the voice of \nminorities and election procedures are being tampered with as \nnonpartisan safeguards fall to the wayside.\n  In the face of this dire onslaught against our democracy, the \nConstitution is clear that Congress has both the power and the \nresponsibility to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act and \nto ensure greater election integrity in our country.\n  And this isn't a case of so-called red States and blue States. Every \nState needs to do more to preserve access to the ballot box, and the \nbill before us ensures that Federal elections in every State will be \nmore secure and more accessible to voters. It sets standards that every \nState can meet and provides the resources for them to do so.\n  Considering the magnitude and urgency of the need for election \nreforms, I am dismayed by Republicans who have spent months blockading \na discussion of these bills on the Senate floor while also refusing to \nnegotiate over any specifics.\n  Sadly, we have been here before. In 1890, then-Representative Henry \nCabot Lodge introduced a Federal elections bill that would reinforce \nthe 15th Amendment and combat the wave of laws disenfranchising Black \nvoters in the South. Though it passed the House, a weeklong Senate \nfilibuster by Southern Democrats and some Western Republicans led to \nthe defeat of the legislation in 1891. Imagine--where would we be if \nvoting rights legislation had existed in the 1890s instead of having to \nwait until 1965? How many thousands of lynchings that took place in \nthose 75 years may have been avoided if Black voters could have had a \nvoice in who was their sheriff, their judge, their mayor, their \nRepresentative, their Senator, their President? How many generations of \nBlack children would have had running water, proper books, and \nqualified teachers in their schoolhouses?\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n  I hope and believe that history will not repeat itself in such a \ngruesome fashion. But I do believe that the impact of the current \ndisenfranchisement will be felt acutely in minority communities, by \nseniors and those with disabilities, and among young people. Without a \nvoice, their legitimate claims for opportunity and equality will be \nmuted, and huge discrepancies in income, education, and opportunity \nwill be perpetuated.\n  We have tried negotiating with the other side. We have offered an \nopen debate to the other side. We have held hearings and taken to the \nfloor to outline the dangers of these State voting changes to our \ndemocracy, but the other side continues to say ``no'' to a debate and \n``no'' to a vote.\n  While many of my colleagues on the other side voted to certify the \n2020 election and some even voted to impeach the former President for \nhis role in the January 6 assault on the Capitol, by blocking this \nbill, they are abetting the former President and his unelected media \nallies in spreading the lie that an election that brought more \nRepublicans to the House of Representatives was somehow ``stolen.'' \nThat claim was false then, and it is false now.\n  In allowing falsehoods about the election results of 2020 to \nproliferate, in celebrating and minimizing the horrors of January 6, \nRepublicans have chosen a path of seeking short-term wins, not \nrealizing that when democracy loses, we all lose.\n  I have a deep respect for Senate rules and precedent, and I have a \nstrong skepticism when I hear suggestions of changing those rules. I \nknow that what goes around can come around, so what may seem beneficial \nin the moment can become deeply detrimental in the future.\n  The filibuster has its place, but at a certain point, the right of \nevery eligible American to exercise their right to vote takes \nprecedence because you cannot have a democracy if your citizens cannot \nvote. It is that simple.\n  For that existential reason, I will vote to change the rules for the \npurposes of this bill and enforce rule XIX so that Senators must \nactually take to the floor and make their case to the American people \nrather than hide behind procedure when it comes to voting rights.\n  Our future as a democracy depends on the willingness of this body to \ndo the right thing and protect voting rights by passing the Freedom to \nVote: John R. Lewis Act. I implore my colleagues: Let's do the right \nthing, and let's do it now.\n  Ms. SMITH. Madam Vice President, I rise today with my Democratic \ncolleagues in support of one fundamental idea, the cornerstone of our \ndemocracy: that every eligible citizen of this country has the right to \nvote and have their vote counted.\n  Cut to the chase, and that is what this about.\n  Passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act would mean saying yes to basic, commonsense standards \nfor free and fair elections; safeguarding our constitutional right to \nchoose our own representatives; and going after dark money in our \npolitics.\n  Failing to pass these bills means we will continue to allow \nRepublican State legislatures to undermine our democracy by suppressing \nsome people's access to their constitutional right to vote, based on \nwho they are, where they live, and whether they are likely to vote \nRepublican.\n  Today on the Senate floor, not a single Republican Senator is willing \nto join us Democrats in support of the Freedom to Vote Act and these \ncommonsense standards for free and fair elections. This is a tragedy.\n  I have been listening to their arguments, and to be honest, they just \ndon't hold water. Republicans argue that the Freedom to Vote Act is a \n``Federal takeover of elections,'' or a power grab. This is ridiculous.\n  The Freedom to Vote Act preserves States' constitutional right to \nprescribe the ``times, places, and manner of holding elections,'' while \nensuring that elections must meet basic standards that allow Americans \nto exercise their right to vote and to have their votes counted, free \nfrom discrimination.\n  Congress shares the constitutional responsibility for preserving our \nfree and fair elections; article I, section 4, says that, ``Congress \nmay at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.'' Furthermore, \nthe 15th, 19th, and 26th Amendments require that we ensure that the \nright of our citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged on \naccount of race, color, sex, or age.\n  These State laws that Republican legislatures are passing are clearly \ndiscriminatory to young voters, Black and Latino voters, and Native \nvoters. Countless studies have shown that these folks are more likely \nthan White voters to be affected by voter purges, polling place \nclosures, the restriction of early voting, and strict photo ID \nrequirements. This isn't an accident or a coincidence. It is the point.\n  Our job, our constitutional responsibility, is to protect against \ndiscrimination just like this. Passing this bill isn't Federal \noverreach; it is our job.\n  Now, Republicans also argue that their voter suppression techniques \naren't actually oppressive or discriminatory; they are designed to root \nout voter fraud. This is not only factually inaccurate--there is no \nevidence of widespread voter fraud--it is offensive.\n  In Ohio, voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods were purged from \nthe voter rolls at twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods. In \nGeorgia, a 2018 voter roll purge removed over 50,000 voters. Over 80 \npercent of them were people of color. Other States, like Texas, have \ninstituted draconian voter ID laws that disproportionately burden Black \nand Latino voters. This is a real problem, not a fake problem.\n  Colleagues, our voting laws reflect what we believe about who should \nhave a voice in this country. They tell us who we are.\n  When Republican State legislatures limit voting hours, close polling \nplaces in Black neighborhoods, and restrict early and absentee voting, \nthey seek to silence some voices: young people, voters of color, and \nvoters in poor neighborhoods. When Republicans narrow the window when \npeople can vote, they make it harder for some folks to exercise their \nright to vote--people with multiple jobs or irregular schedules, people \nwith childcare or transportation challenges, seniors, people with \ndisabilities, and anyone who can't afford to wait in an hours-long line \nat their polling place.\n  We cannot ignore--or pretend not to see--the line connecting these \ndiscriminatory State laws and the dark history of Jim Crow, our \ncountry's legacy of denying some people, as my colleague Reverend \nWarnock says, their constitutional rights.\n  If we want to make more voices heard, we know what to do. My home \nState of Minnesota consistently has the highest voter turnout in the \nNation. This happens because we have strong voting laws that empower \npeople to make their voices heard while keeping our elections safe and \nsecure. We have online and same-day voter registration, vote-by-mail \nand early voting, and voters have the right to take time off of work to \nvote in all State and Federal elections. We have paper ballots to \nensure election integrity. These policies work to expand ballot access \nand improve voter turnout. The Freedom to Vote Act would implement many \nof them as minimum national standards.\n  So why are Republicans united in their opposition to this bill? The \nsimplest answer is they believe they can't win if more people's voices \nare heard and counted.\n  In Georgia in 2020, when Senate Democrats saw voters waiting up to 10 \nhours to cast their votes and Black voters waiting much longer than \nWhite voters, we wrote a bill that would expand access to early voting, \nvote-by-mail, and make election day a Federal holiday. Republican State \nlegislators in Georgia saw the same thing and passed a law to make it a \ncrime to give food or water to voters waiting in line, remove drop \nboxes, and restrict voting by mail. For the past several years, \nRepublicans have engaged in a coordinated strategy of voter \nsuppression. According to the Brennan Center, in 2021 alone, 19 States \npassed over 30 laws restricting voting rights.\n  Today in the Senate, every single Democrat is united in our effort to \nprotect people's right to vote. And today, all 50 Republicans will \nblock passage of this voting rights legislation.\n  We may lose this battle today, which is heartbreaking. It is \nmaddening that a majority of U.S. Senators, representing 41 million \nmore people than\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\nour Republican colleagues, cannot pass a bill to make critical election \nreforms that are supported by strong majorities of Americans, all \nbecause of an arcane Senate rule. That is just not right, and it is \nlong past time to fix it. In a democracy, after the debate is done, a \nmajority of the people decide. That is how it works in township \nmeetings, in city halls and county board meetings, in State \nlegislatures, and that is how it should work in the U.S. Senate.\n  But this fight won't be over today. I have faith that, eventually, we \nwill win. I have faith, not because I believe in the inevitability of \nprogress, but because I have faith in the righteousness of this fight, \nand I have faith in our democracy.\n  Dr. King taught us that progress is not a straight line. The story of \nchange in this country, more often than not, is a story of people \npracticing their civic faith through defeat, people doing the work \ndespite not having the votes, people who keep putting one foot in front \nof the other because they believe they will reach their destination, \neven if they can't quite see the path to get there. I am honored to \nwalk that path with the thousands of organizers, activists, and voters \nwho share that civic faith.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Freedom to Vote Act and the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, just for a minute, I want to first \nsalute the amazing speeches by our two Senators from Georgia--Georgia, \nwhich has been the crucible in our fight for voting rights, where the \nattempts to curtail voting rights seem most pernicious. To both of you, \nyour erudition, your eloquence, your passion were amazing.\n  And I want to salute our Republican colleagues who listened to the \nspeeches, and hope that those who weren't here will get a chance to \nreview those speeches as well.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Madam President, now, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call with respect to the pending cloture motion be waived.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \npermitted to complete their remarks prior to the scheduled vote: \nSenator Blunt, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Schumer.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I have been on the floor most of the day \ntoday, and I think I heard virtually every speech given. I was reminded \nagain, as the day went on, of really the broad-based talent of people \nin the Senate.\n  I spent some time, a couple of years ago, over the course of about 6 \nmonths, kind of watching individual Senators and trying to figure out \nhow they got here. And with only a couple of exceptions, I could figure \nit out: that unique ability to communicate or to explain things in a \nway that people understood them or to appear to just know more than \nother people knew about things that people knew Senators need to know \nabout. And I was reminded again of the tragedy of how little we use \nthat collective talent.\n  There is absolutely no telling what we could do if we would decide, \nas 100 people who figured out how to get to the U.S. Senate, how we \nwould work together and solve big problems.\n  And I think we all know where we are today. But I do hope, as Senator \nSchumer mentioned, that we listen to each other as people express \ndifferent views. Certainly, the Senate would be a better place if we \nspent more time on the floor listening to each other and talking to \neach other.\n  Now, on this bill, I think we all know where we are headed. In my \nview, having watched election legislation for a long time, it seems to \nme this is just another version of an election bill introduced by \nDemocrats. There is not much new in this bill. Both the Rules \nCommittee, where I serve, and the Senate have already rejected this \nFederal takeover of elections several times this year.\n  Now, many of my friends on the other side said: Well, why wouldn't \nRepublicans just want to debate this bill?\n  I don't think anybody said: Why wouldn't the Republicans want to \namend this bill--because there was no opportunity to do that.\n  We have been on the bill now for several days. We got on the bill. It \nwas a fairly crafty way to get on the bill, with a 51-vote vote. It is \nfine with me to be on the bill. But our friends on the other side \ndecided there would be no amendments on this bill. And I think \nRepublicans, from the very start, sensed that this would be a bill \nwhere we would get a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on a bill that really would \ndramatically change how we pursue elections.\n  Now, while it has a new name--it is more than 700 pages--it is nearly \nidentical to the Freedom to Vote Act. It is substantially the same as \nthe two versions that couldn't get 50 on that side, S. 1; very similar \nto the Senate bill, H.R. 1; and very similar, frankly, to the election \nbills that I have been watching for 20 years. And there has always been \na different reason to do about the same Democrat-sponsored bill in the \nHouse and Senate. After 2020, the reason was, well, the equipment is \ntoo faulty, and we have got to have more Federal control of what \nhappens in the States. After 2016, the reason to have a massive \nelection bill was, well, there is just not enough security in State \nelections, and the Federal Government has to intervene in some major \nway. After 2020, even though the Federal Government didn't intervene in \na major way, suddenly the elections were the most secure in the history \nof the world. Both parties alleged that at one point.\n  Now, we need to have this bill because some States are passing \nlegislation that in most cases looks at the real outreach that they \nappropriately did for the pandemic, and thinking in 2021 that the \npandemic was over, thinking, what do we want to keep from what we did \nin that outreach, and what do we want to decide we should only do \nduring a pandemic?\n  I haven't found very many places, if any, that couldn't be easily \nexplained, like postal regulations and other things, where the States \nhave made changes and rolled back their pandemic outreach, where they \ndon't have more opportunities to vote now than they had in 2018, the \nlast election before they should have done extraordinary things.\n  Actually, one lesson we probably taught State legislators here is, \ndon't do anything to try to amend an immediate moment because if you \ntry to undo it when that moment has passed, you will get on what \nSenator Lankford described as the ``bad list.'' He also did a pretty \ngood job explaining that a lot of States that weren't on the bad list \ndon't have nearly the opportunities to vote as the States that are on \nthe bad list.\n  I was an election official for about 20 years, including the \nsecretary of state for a good part of that time, and I always thought \nthat the diversity of the system was one of the strengths of the \nsystem. I thought, as President Obama did in 2016, that the diversity \nof the system made it really hard for outsiders or insiders to figure \nout how they could rig a national election. I still think that.\n  This bill undermines, really, a lot of State voter laws that are \npretty popular with voters, and we have seen that expressed even in \nrecent elections in like New York City. Prohibiting voter \nidentification for mail-in ballots would be one of the things that you \nwouldn't want to do. If you wanted to have mail-in ballots, you would \nwant to be sure where those came from. Frankly, you would want to have \nan objective standard, like your voter ID number or some other number \nthat was uniquely yours, rather than a subjective standard, like how \nyou signed your name when you were 18 as opposed to how you are signing \nyour name when you are 68. That was one of the changes, by the way, in \nthe Georgia law, which should have helped more people than not.\n  This bill retains S. 1's mandate on ballot drop boxes and federalizes \nrules for redistricting. I think it chills free speech and requires \nfelon voting. Now, why would anybody want to be against any of those \nthings? There are reasons, frankly, to be against all of those things, \nbut States make that decision for themselves, and in some States, it \nmay work very well, and in others, it might not.\n  Of the top sweeping election administration changes in this bill, the \nS. 1\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\npolicies in this bill disrupt State efforts to maintain accurate voter \nrolls. Now, accurate voter rolls were seen as one of the great \nprogressive moves forward so you would have some sense that the people \nwho voted on election day were actually people who were supposed to \nvote, and it is also important to vote in that district. If you just \nvote anywhere, and your legislative district where you should have \nvoted was decided by four or five votes and you were one of those four \nor five, suddenly, that is a bit of a disservice to everybody else.\n  The bill would send Federal money to campaign coffers at the rate of \n6 Federal dollars for every dollar raised. It even goes so far as to \nadd a second public financing program that would give people $25 in \nFederal funds to contribute to House candidates. Now, this 6-to-1 match \nis only for House candidates. That may not be what the final bill would \nsay if we passed this bill, but it is only for House candidates now. \nAnd, of course, this Federal money would be eligible to be matched by 6 \nto 1 other Federal dollars. That is a pretty good deal. You give \nsomebody 25 Federal dollars, and it could be matched with 6 to 1 other \nFederal dollars.\n  This bill sets up a framework that would result in, I think, every \ncongressional district map likely to be drawn by Federal courts. How \nmany maps have we seen this time that were drawn by new improvements \nthat the States made that didn't turn out to be, one, any better than \nthe old maps and, two, wound up being drawn by judges?\n  The John Lewis Voting Rights Act--he was a friend of mine. I served \nwith him. I traveled with him. I laughed with him. I liked him a lot. I \nadmired him a lot. The Voting Rights Act was 12 pages when it was \nintroduced in 1965. The John Lewis Voting Rights provisions here have a \ngreat name, but they are 120 pages. I voted to extend the Voting Rights \nAct, and I would do it again, and I would be proud to do it if it was \nnamed for John Lewis. But 735 pages, and saying that if we don't vote \nfor that 735 pages, somehow we are opposed to the Voting Rights Act or \nopposed to the heroism of John Lewis? I don't think so.\n  Since it doesn't have the support to pass under the current Senate \nrules, the next thing we will do is attempt to really gut the \nlegislative filibuster to force it through.\n  My Republican colleagues have spoken at length about the consequences \nof doing that, as have Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema just the \nother day. The justification rests on really a narrow basis that \nsomehow the protection of the minority no longer matters.\n  The danger of overturning 200 years of election administration by the \nStates--I am going to resist doing any of the quotes this late in the \nday that you have heard over and over again of our Democratic friends \nwho just a couple of years ago were saying--or less than a handful of \nyears ago--how critically important it was that those rules never be \nchanged.\n  You know, if Democrats eliminate the 60-vote rule for election \nlegislation, there will soon be no filibuster left.\n  Today, it would be a carve-out for the election administration. Three \nor four weeks ago, it was a carve-out for raising the debt limit. The \nnext carve-out would be for whatever seems to be important that day.\n  The carve-out won't work. I don't think anybody here believes that \nany longer. This would be the first step in just eliminating an \nimportant distinction that makes the Senate a place where we have to \nthink about what we do. It eliminates some of the chaos that occurs \nwhen you have a party change.\n  In the past two decades, a single party has controlled both Chambers \nof the Congress and the Presidency four times, alternating between \nDemocrats and Republicans. The Senate is what has kept the country from \nwildly going from one direction back to the other. We don't want to \nlose that. It would be a disaster for our citizens, a disaster for our \neconomy. Having that sense of having to think about this just a little \nbit before you head in another direction is what the Senate is all \nabout.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues today will not pass this Federal \ntakeover of election laws and will also resist the temptation to change \nthe rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam Vice President, I rise today after hearing from \nmy friend Senator Blunt. I remember on January 6, as all of you do that \nday, when he and I and Vice President Pence and two young women with \nthe mahogany box filled with the last of the ballots--up to Wyoming--\ntook that long walk through the shattered glass, the spray-painted \nstatues, and we did our jobs. I will be forever grateful for what he \ndid that night and what so many people in this Chamber did.\n  But, for me, it didn't end that night because, sadly, what wasn't \naccomplished by the people who rifled through these desks and got up on \nthat dais, Madam Vice President; what wasn't accomplished with bear \nspray; what wasn't accomplished with the bayonets--and I still remember \nthe blood on the officers' faces--sadly has continued on.\n  The votes that we took that night were important, but the votes that \nthe people of this country take in every election are just as \nimportant. That is why, when you look at the Freedom to Vote: John R. \nLewis Act, you have to understand what it is grounded in, and that is \nour belief in our democracy.\n  I want to thank every single Member of the Democratic caucus who has \nworked so hard to agree on this bill. I will say the voting rights \ngroups, the Rules Committee--and I do differ from Senator Blunt on \nthis. We spent a lot of time making changes to that bill over the year. \nWe have made many changes in response to concerns from secretaries of \nstate and local election officials all across this country.\n  I also thank the Vice President and the President for your \nleadership.\n  Since this country's founding when brave patriots rose up and \nultimately established a country in the name of ``we the people,'' \nAmerica has been a shining beacon for the world, a touchstone for \ndemocracy.\n  We travel the world as Senators, as Senators Shaheen and Portman and \nI and several of our Democratic and Republican colleagues did just this \nweekend. When we went to decry dictators and bullies who attempt to \nundermine democracies, as Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine, we were \nproud on that trip to wear lapel pins with the Ukrainian flag on one \nside and the U.S. flag on the other. We are proud of our democracy, and \nthat democracy is fundamentally based on the freedom to vote.\n  Over the years, we made improvements to address wrongs that kept too \nmany Americans from joining in the rights on which our Nation was \nfounded. But for generation after generation, Americans have believed \ntruly in our country's founding promise. They fought for it, and they \ndied for it.\n  We are here today against that backdrop of history, at a time when \nour democracy is facing a new wave of threat, a flood that has surged \nup since the 2020 elections, when more Americans cast a ballot than \never before as a pandemic raged. It is up to us to turn back that tide \nand to preserve the right that lies at the bedrock of our system of \ngovernment.\n  Again, I disagree with Senator Blunt about what has been going on. I \nlook at the law that was passed in Montana that Senator Tester \ndescribed. That was set in place for 15 years for same-day registration \nin the State of Montana--15 years. In the last election, 8,000 people \ntook advantage of it on election day, either newly registering to vote \nor changing their address because they moved. It was just taken away \nfrom them with what one court described for another law years ago in \nNorth Carolina as ``surgical precision.''\n  You look at what our friends Senator Ossoff and Senator Warnock have \ndescribed has happened in Georgia, where 70,000 people registered \nduring that last week of the election in the runoff period--70,000 \npeople in the last election. That has been stripped away, passed into \nlaw that that cannot happen again.\n  The Founding Fathers knew that our democracy would face obstacles. A \nlot of people have been quoting them. I will quote this one from Samuel \nAdams. He said this:\n\n       The liberties of our country . . . are worth defending [at] \n     all hazards. And it is our duty to defend them against all \n     attacks.\n\n  When you have had over 9,000 threats against Members of Congress in \njust\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nthe last year--double, triple what we have seen before--I don't see \nthat walk we took, that really important walk--that it all ended that \nday. When you have local election officials across this country being \nthreatened and the names of their kids and their homes put out on the \ninternet, like the Republican local election official in Senator \nCasey's home State of Pennsylvania--his house, his kids, with a threat \nthat said: ``Tell the Truth Or Your Three Kids Will Be Fatally Shot''--\nit is on all of us to uphold and protect this democracy.\n  The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act meets the challenges before us \nby establishing basic Federal standards for our election, restoring and \nstrengthening the Voting Rights Act, countering the power of secret \nmoney in our politics, and taking on new threats to our elections to \nensure that every vote is properly counted.\n  And, again, let me read from the Constitution from article I, section \n4. That clause empowers Congress to ``make or alter'' rules for Federal \nelections ``at any time''--at any time.\n  As Senator Kaine noted, that is the only time that ``any time'' is \nused in the Constitution, ``at any time.''\n  The word ``filibuster'' isn't in this document. The word ``cloture'' \nisn't in this document. But it was anticipated that Congress could and \nshould be involved in Federal elections when necessary.\n  What brought us to the point today? We are here in the midst of a \nconcerted effort to stop people from exercising the most fundamental \nright in our democracy. Because, as Reverend Warnock has put so well, \n``some people don't want some people to vote.''\n  We are here because the people of this country know what is going on. \nI am talking about a veteran in Georgia who didn't have to stand in \nline to serve his country, but he had to--I met him myself. He had to \nstand in line hours and hours and hours in the hot Sun just to cast a \nballot.\n  We are here because of those voters in Wisconsin who stood in the \nrain, in homemade masks and garbage bags in the beginning of a \npandemic, just to exercise their right to vote. We are here because of \na voter in a wheelchair in Texas who traveled 3 hours on four buses \njust to vote; a woman in Montana who had open-heart surgery, uncertain \nabout how to return her mail ballot; a former election official from a \nrural county was ousted by Republicans in the Georgia Legislature after \na decade of service; and a 92-year-old woman who was purged from the \nrolls after voting in every election for decades, since 1968.\n  We are here because after a record number of voters voted to make \ntheir voices heard, there are people, sadly, who are working in every \nState capitol to make sure it never happens again.\n  And I note that for every one of these laws that have passed in 19 \ndifferent States, it has been with a simple majority, State by State by \nState--a simple majority.\n  And then, as was noted by several of my colleagues, after this \nChamber has established over 160 carve-outs, 160 processes in law to \nallow for a final vote without a 60-vote threshold--whether it is for \nthe debt ceiling, whether it is for the Bush tax cuts, whether it is \nfor the Trump tax cuts, whether it is for Justice Amy Coney Barrett--51 \nvotes--now we hear, at this very moment, that we must embrace this \narchaic rule that is not in the Constitution and did not exist when the \nSenate was founded.\n  And we are not even talking about getting rid of this rule. We are \nsimply talking about restoring the Senate to what it once was so we can \nhave debates, and we can actually vote on bills when those debates have \nconcluded and when the speeches are exhausted.\n  We are here because we took an oath to defend the Constitution as we \ndid that night on January 6. We are here because we know that the eyes \nof the world are on us, watching to see if America will stand up and \ntake on the challenges of our time.\n  To paraphrase Dr. King, whose legacy has been honored many, many \ntimes today, while there may be finite disappointment in this country \nfor so many people every day, we must never lose infinite hope.\n  We are not losing it. That, my friends, is why we on the Democratic \nside of the aisle are supporting this bill. With history's eyes on us \nand with so much at stake, we must and we will fight on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam Vice President, what kind of democracy shall \nendure here in the United States long after our times in this Chamber \ncome to an end? Shall American democracy in the 21st century be called \na true heir to our Framers' vision--a nation where the people choose \ntheir own leaders, forge their own destiny, and add to the great \nlegacies of those who expanded the franchise before us or shall we see \nAmerican democracy backslide in our time, grow feeble in the jaws of \nits adversaries, and ultimately succumb to the cancer of voter \nsuppression?\n  The answer, in a large sense, could depend on how we move forward \nthis evening. As we have clearly laid out in over the past 2 days, the \nlaws passed in legislatures throughout the country do nothing less than \nto discourage and prevent certain kinds of Americans--Black and Brown \nAmericans, young Americans, elderly Americans, low-income Americans--\nfrom participating in the democratic process.\n  My colleagues, my colleagues, we can begin to put a stop to these \nattacks tonight by voting to proceed to the final passage of the \nFreedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. \nThese are good bills; these are effective bills; and they should be \npassed by this Chamber as soon as possible.\n  And if cloture is not invoked, we must change the rules of the Senate \nso we can pass these bills into law. As we cast our votes, I urge every \none of us, Democrat and Republican, not to discount our place in \nhistory. The story of American democracy is full of contradictions and \nhalting progress.\n  At the time of our Constitution's ratification, you had to be in many \nStates a White, male, Protestant landowner to vote. But ever since the \nearly days of this grand Republic, Americans launched mighty movements, \nfought a bloody civil war, and, yes, passed Federal election laws to \nexpand the franchise until there were no more boundaries.\n  Today's vote is the next step in that long march. Are we going to let \nour democracy backslide in the 21st century? Are we going to be dragged \nback into the abyss of voter suppression?\n  I urge every one of my colleagues, left, right, and middle, for the \nsake of our democracy, unite, take a stand today.\n  To every Member of this body who treasures our precious experiment in \nself-rule, to every Member horrified by the muck of voter suppression, \nand to everyone who believes this Chamber is still capable of defending \ndemocracy in its hour of great need, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     5746, a bill to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend \n     the authority of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration to enter into leases of non-excess property of \n     the Administration.\n         Charles E.

Madam Vice President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nfailed cloture vote.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as we head toward the final hour of \ndebate, I want to just bring us back about 20 feet to talk about the \nstakes that we are laboring under tonight.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the big picture of why this \nmatters.\n  I know we have changed the rules 160 times in the history of the \nSenate, but I will submit that it is still an extraordinary endeavor to \nask our colleagues to change the rules and traditions of this body.\n  And so here is what I want to say: It is really important to remember \nthat democracy, this idea that every member of our country, every \nmember of the community gets an equal say in the rules that govern us, \nit is unnatural.\n  Why do I know this? Because I want you to think of every organization \nin your life that matters. Your workplace; it doesn't give equal votes \nto every employee as to the direction of the company. Think about your \nfavorite sports team. There is not a vote from all the players about \nthe lineups or the strategy of the team. The Sunday sermon at your \nchurch isn't chosen by an online poll of the congregation.\n  I love my kids, but they don't get an equal say with me and my wife \nabout the rules of our house.\n  When you look out over the long stretch of human history, it is no \nwonder that 99.9 percent of humans have lived under governments that \nwere monarchies or sultanates or autocracies.\n  Since the beginning of time, human beings have preferred, have been \nnaturally drawn to or maybe have been trapped in hierarchal systems \nwhere the strong and the powerful make the decisions for everyone else.\n  The idea that humans, both the weak and the powerful, the rich and \nthe poor, should decide together, each person having equal weight, the \ncourse of their Nation--this idea is revolutionary.\n  There have been experiments over the course of world history, but no \nnation has sustained this idea longer than this one. In historical \ncontext, our democracy should be perceived as a tiny, fragile port in \nthe middle of a raging storm, and none of us should be surprised that \nonce in a while some Americans, drawn to the old system of control by \nthe strong and powerful, decide that it is time to give up and submit \nto the battering winds.\n  That is the moment we are in today. Just in the last few days, former \nPresident Donald Trump, the leader of the Republican Party and their \nlikely candidate for President in 2024, once again, made clear his \nintent.\n  He said last week:\n\n       We have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to \n     counting the votes. . . . Sometimes the vote counter is more \n     important than the candidate.\n\n  The leader of the Republican Party isn't even trying to hide his \nagenda any longer. State after State is changing the rules of who \ncounts the votes so that only the allies of Donald Trump can decide \nwhich votes count and which votes don't.\n  Now, much of the focus today, understandably, has been on the \nunconscionable rules that limit the ability of poor people or people of \ncolor to vote, and it is heinous that Black voters have to wait in \nlines that are two times or ten times longer than a White voter. But \ndemocracy may actually collapse when Trump's plan to rig the next count \nsucceeds in plain view for everybody to see. He broadcasts that in the \nnext election the vote counting will be more important than the quality \nof the candidates.\n  Why? Because the plan is to install Donald Trump as President, \nwhether or not he actually wins the election, just like he tried to do \nafter the 2020 election.\n  Can anybody really deny that this is the agenda?\n  Of course, that is what he is doing, because it is what he tried to \ndo transparently, unapologetically in 2020, and that is what he is \ntelling us he is going to do in 2024. At some point, we just have to \nbelieve what we see and what we hear.\n  And I appreciate Senator Thune coming to the floor earlier today and \ntelling us that he believed Joe Biden won the election and that when he \nfaced a close election, he submitted to the will of the voters. But \nSenator Thune is not the mainstream of the Republican Party today. In \nfact, those that believe Joe Biden won the election in the Republican \nParty are the dead limbs of an otherwise perfectly healthy tree. The \ntrunk of that tree is Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene and all \nthose who believe that Joe Biden is an illegitimate President. That is \nwhat 70 percent of Republicans believe today.\n  If mainstream Republicans in this body came to Connecticut and held a \nrally, a dozen people would show up. Marjorie Taylor Greene came to my \nState and 3,000 Republicans came--more than I have ever seen show up \nfor a Republican, because that is the mainstream of the Republican \nParty.\n  Today, we are voting on a proposal to change our rules so that we can \nprotect our democracy and the rules that have stood for generations to \nassure that both parties continue to have a role in counting the votes. \nAnd while it feels astonishing that not a single Republican is going to \njoin us today--not the Trump cheerleaders nor the sometimes critics of \nthe former President--maybe it shouldn't be that shocking, because of \nthat natural state that billions of humans have defaulted to over the \nmillennium, the unelected rich and powerful being in charge of \neverything and setting the rules for everyone else.\n  It might square perfectly with Republicans' agenda. For the last \ndecade, the entire legislative agenda here, when Republicans have been \nin charge, has been about giving more power, more money, more influence \nto the rich and powerful. They oppose President Biden's agenda to give \ntax breaks to the poor and the middle class or to cut profits for the \ndrug companies, because it empowers that agenda, often the weak and the \npowerless.\n  Maybe Republicans aren't fighting to protect democracy like Democrats \nare because a reversion to a world where just the rich and powerful run \nthe country just isn't as scary to that side of this body as it is to \nthis side.\n  I wish it weren't up to us. I wish it didn't have to come to this. I \nwish it was not only Democrats that see the miracle of our fragile \ndemocracy, because the idea that a worker making $12 an hour has just \nas much say in the future of their country as the CEO making $12 \nmillion a year, it is revolutionary. It is unnatural. And it matters \nmore than anything, even the traditions and the rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I came here 9 years ago opposed to modifying \nthe rules of the filibuster. Indeed, I signed a letter a couple of \nyears ago saying the same thing. I understand that it can and probably \nwill boomerang, that an elimination of the filibuster--what is today's \nannoying obstruction could be tomorrow's priceless shield. I get that.\n  I understand that it can also be a spur to bipartisanship. We all saw \nthat several years ago in the CARES Act. The Republican leader \nsubmitted a bill. It was voted down on a filibuster initially, and then \nthere ensued a series of negotiations that improved the bill and made \nit a bipartisan bill that passed this body unanimously.\n  The problem is, if it is being used as a spur to bipartisan \ndiscussions, that works. We saw it work with the CARES Act. But if it \nis used simply to stop something, in other words, if one side or the \nother just doesn't even want to talk about the subject, what you are \ntalking about is stone cold obstruction, and that is where we are \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, part of this body just doesn't want to talk about the \nissue of voting rights. How do I know that? Because we brought up a \nmotion to proceed three times, and it was voted down three times--a \nmotion to proceed to have a discussion about this issue. The only \nreason we are having this debate today is that the majority leader \nfound a rule that, frankly, I never heard of that enabled us to bring \nthis to the floor. It wasn't because the other side said: Oh, let's \ndiscuss voting rights.\n  What we have now is not a filibuster. It is a second cousin once \nremoved of a filibuster. It doesn't require any effort. It doesn't \nrequire any speeches. It doesn't require to hold the floor. All it is \nis a dial-in, no-work filibuster. Strom Thurmond would have loved this \nfilibuster. He wouldn't have had to stand here for 24 hours. And I \nventure to say that if we had the rules that we have today, we wouldn't \nhave the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, because it was too \neasy to stop anything.\n  That is the problem. We don't really have a filibuster. The real \nradical change in the filibuster rule was in 1975, when they wanted to \ngo from two-thirds of those present voting to 60 votes, but, \ninadvertently, we created the no-effort filibuster, and that is what we \nhave now.\n  I would submit that a talking filibuster, which is what we are going \nto be proposing in a few minutes, would be the real spur to \nbipartisanship because everybody would want to get it over with. The \nminority would want to get it over with, and the majority would want to \nget it over with, and get to a point where there would be discussion. \nAnd I believe, listening to the debate today, based upon the discussion \ntoday, that I think there may be some areas where we can find \nagreement.\n  The real spur to bipartisanship would be to return to the old \nfilibuster. This is what we are going to be voting on today.\n  And, by the way, on bipartisanship, I came here to seek \nbipartisanship. I am all about bipartisanship. But it strikes me as one \nof the deep ironies of this discussion that we are elevating \nbipartisanship in this body to this exalted position while these laws \nare being passed entirely on a partisan basis in all these States \nacross the country. I guess bipartisanship is an important principle in \nWashington, but in Atlanta and Austin, not so much. I don't get that. I \nthink that is one of the real ironies of this situation.\n  So, Angus, if you came here opposed 9 years ago, why are you changing \nnow? Because what we are talking about today isn't policy; it is \nstructure. It is our democracy itself.\n  Policy can change. If they don't like the policy we pass, they can \nkick us out and vote other people in. If we change the structure that \ndiminishes the right of people to vote, it is not self-\ncorrecting anymore. The system itself is being compromised. That is \nwhat we have to talk about.\n\n  And we are not only talking. All of the discussion or most of the \ndiscussion today has been about voter suppression. There is also what I \ncall voter subversion--purging the officials in charge of elections.\n  This democracy, I would argue, was damn near saved by a guy named \nBrad Raffensperger in Georgia. They purged him--or they are going to. \nThey have already purged him out of the system, and they are going to \ntry to purge him out of his job. That is happening. And we talk about \ngiving people in the legislature--a partisan legislature--the ability \nto dismiss voting boards because they don't like what they did? We are \ngoing to see more and more voting boards, voting commissioners, \ncertification officials being purged because they don't want to get the \nresults that they don't agree with.\n  The other problem here that really worries me about our democracy is \nthat the former President's efforts to undermine confidence in our \nelections have already convinced two-thirds of one of our great \npolitical parties that the elections were illegitimate and were rigged. \nTwo-thirds of one of our great political parties now believes that.\n  If these laws that are happening across the country--and they are \ngoing to continue happening. By the way, if we give them a pass today, \nit is Katy, bar the door, over the next 6 months. Then you are going to \ndisillusion and anger and loss of trust among two-thirds of the \nDemocratic Party and Independents, and you are going to have widespread \ndistrust of elections as the way we solve our problems in this country. \nAnd if you can't trust elections, what do you do?\n  I would submit that we saw it on January 6. Those people had been \ntold that something was stolen from them, and they couldn't trust \nelections. They couldn't trust the courts. They couldn't trust the \nmedia. So they took the law into their own hands. And, sadly, if this \ncontinues, we will have a broad widespread loss of trust in our \nelectoral process, and that is when democracy starts to fall apart.\n  Finally--my wife says I say ``finally'' too much and it gets people's \nhopes up.\n  Finally, there are some deeper constitutional issues here. The \nFramers knew fractions. They said it takes two-thirds to pass a treaty. \nIt takes two-thirds to impeach a President. It takes two-thirds to pass \na constitutional amendment. It takes three-quarters of the States to \npass a constitutional amendment. They knew fractions. They didn't apply \nany fractions when they talked about the passage of legislation. Why \nnot? Because they knew it would be a disaster to have a supermajority \nrequirement in one of the Houses of the national legislature.\n  How do I know that? Because Madison and Hamilton said it explicitly \nin Federalist 22 by Hamilton, Federalist 58 by Madison. Madison said:\n\n       The fundamental principle of free government [if you have a \n     supermajority requirement] would be reversed. It would be no \n     longer the majority that would rule: the power would be \n     transferred to the minority.\n\n  You can't have it both ways. It is either majority rule or its \nminority rule, and the filibuster was not part of the Constitution. In \nfact, they expressly and explicitly rejected that idea of a \nsupermajority requirement. It flips democracy on its head.\n  I think we are at a hinge of history, Mr. President. I think we are \nat a hinge of history where our fragile experiment--and Senator Murphy \nis right, we are an anomaly in world history. The norm is pharaohs and \nKings and dictators, and now we call them Presidents for life.\n  And once people seize power, look at what--and this isn't an academic \ndiscussion. This has happened in Hungary, in Turkey, and Venezuela--in \nRussia. It has happened right in our personal experiences. It can \nhappen here, and it starts with undermining free and fair elections.\n  In the winter of 1891, the House passed a protection act for Black \nvoters in the South. The bill was to deal with the egregious voter \nsuppression that was then sweeping the South in the wake of the Civil \nWar. The bill came here and died due to a filibuster. That filibuster \nechoed in this country for 75 years. It took 75 years to correct the \nmistake that this body made with that filibuster in the winter of 1891.\n\n  We are not talking about abolishing the filibuster. We are not \ntalking about a carve-out. We are talking about allowing this body--\nrequiring this body--to debate, to argue, to make their arguments as \nlong as it takes, and then, at the end, when the debate is exhausted, \nwhen all of us have had the opportunity to speak twice, then we have a \nvote, and we pass legislation on the same basis that it has always been\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\npassed--by a majority. Cloture has nothing to do with the passage of \nlegislation. It has always been by a majority.\n  I pray that we don't look back on this day and realize the level of \nthe mistake that they made in 1891.\n  Abraham Lincoln's words ring today as they did when he came to this \nbody in December of 1862.\n  He said:\n\n       Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this \n     Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite \n     of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, \n     can spare one another of us. The fiery trial through which we \n     pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest \n     generation.\n\n  ``The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor \nor dishonor, to the latest generation.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am glad that a number of my Republican \ncolleagues are in the Chamber because I am going to speak very briefly \njust to reassure you that I am not so immodest that I believe I am \ngoing to persuade you, but I do want to try to reassure you.\n  We are going to take up a rules reform proposal that will not blow up \nthe Senate. We are going to take up a rules reform proposal that will \nnot abolish the filibuster, that will not weaken the filibuster. We are \ngoing to take up a proposal that will show you, even if you are not \npersuaded, that we have been listening to you, that we have been \nlistening to all of our colleagues, as we try to come up with a rules \nreform proposal to let us address the voting rights issue.\n  I am glad to see Senator Collins and Senator Coons here on the floor. \nThey helped put together the 2017 letter that many of us signed. It is \nvery carefully worded, and it is two paragraphs. What they got us to \njoin together as bipartisan Senators to express was our united \ndetermination to preserve the ability of Members to engage in extended \ndebate when bills are on the Senate floor--extended debate when bills \nare on the Senate floor--and that is what our rules reform proposal \nwill do.\n  The simplest way to understand it--and Senator Merkley is going to go \ninto more detail--is that it switches the current secret filibuster \ninto a public filibuster and makes both parties have to work on the \nfloor. The majority has to work and the minority has to work on the \nfloor to get the kind of extended public debate that we joined together \nto seek in the letter in 2017.\n  Let's face it. We don't really do this. The current rules are an \nobstacle to extended debate because you just vote down the motion to \nproceed, and you can't even get on a bill. Then, if you do get on a \nbill, the 60-vote cloture threshold is used, with confidence, by a \nfilibustering minority. You don't even have to show up to debate \nbecause there is an awareness that you can't get 60 votes to terminate \ndebate. So, instead of trying to change the rule about terminating \ndebate--which, as my colleague Senator Manchin pointed out, to \nterminate debate has always required more than a simple majority--we \nare going to restore actually having debate, and when debate is \nfinished, the rules of this Senate have always been, when debate is \nfinished, even after a long time, passage is by a simple majority.\n  Our proposal is to restore a talking filibuster, which has been the \nhistory of this Senate over the vast majority of our history, and to \nmake a simple change to make it public rather than secret so that our \ncolleagues and the American public can understand and then hold us \naccountable for our actions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me say that I appreciate the \nsincerity of the Senator from Virginia--my friend Senator Kaine--and \nhis comments about the filibuster. I am not going to repeat the speech \nthat I gave last week on the vital safeguards that the filibuster \nprovides to the minority party in the U.S. Senate and why it makes us \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  Instead, since I have already talked on that issue, I feel compelled \nto respond to comments that were made by Senator Ossoff, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, earlier this evening, in which he singled out four \nRepublican Senators--Senator McConnell, Senator Cornyn, Senator Burr, \nand myself--and our position on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a \nseminal law that was so important in the civil rights movement in \nguaranteeing the right to vote for all Americans.\n  Well, I was not in the Senate in 1965. I was 13. I am not sure that \nthe Senator from Georgia was even born in 1965, but that is not really \nmy point.\n  My point is that, of me, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Ossoff, said: \nSenator Collins previously said that this bill will ensure that voting \nrights afforded to all Americans are protected but not anymore.\n  I voted, enthusiastically, and did say that about the Voting Rights \nAct reauthorization in 2006. Surely, my colleague is not confusing that \nbill, which was 5 pages long--5 pages--with the bill that is before the \nSenate tonight, which is 735-pages long. Surely, he is not confusing \nthose two bills. If he is, I would like to sit down and talk with him \nabout the enormous differences between the two bills, but, frankly, the \nnumber of pages says it all.\n  I do support the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nand I did so, as did every other Senator, in 2006, but to equate that \nto the legislation that is before us now is simply not worthy. Had I \nbeen on the floor at that time, I might well have thought of reminding \nthe Senator that we have a rule in the Senate, rule XIX, which \nprohibits the impunity, the integrity, or the motives of other \nSenators--and not just one Senator in this case but four Senators.\n  So let there be no mistake about it, I do support the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965. I supported the Voting Rights Act of 2006, as did every \none of my colleagues who was mentioned by Senator Ossoff this evening, \nand I think it is sad that he implied otherwise about our support for \nsuch important civil rights legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, briefly, in responding to the comments \nfrom Senator Collins from Maine--a Senator for whom I have great \nrespect and whose reputation for bipartisanship, for substance, and for \na thoughtful statespersonlike and patriotic approach to legislation \nprecedes her--what I was referring to, Senator Collins, was the \nlegislation that the Senate took up earlier this year, which, in \nresponse to the Supreme Court's invitation to Congress after the Shelby \nCounty v. Holder decision, would have updated the preclearance formulas \nthat govern section 4 and section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \nsuch that the Department of Justice could continue to carry out its \nvital work of preclearing changes to voting procedures in States and \njurisdictions that exhibit a history or a pattern of voter suppression.\n  That is an obligation that I believe this Congress has. The Supreme \nCourt, in fact, invited us to carry out that obligation, and the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, under Senator Durbin's leadership, \ncarefully crafted legislation that we believed responded to the Supreme \nCourt's invitation to do just that.\n  Respectfully, Senator Collins, in representing the State of Georgia, \nwhere, as I mentioned earlier, we faced a wave of bills and now law, \nwhich everybody in my State knows are intended deliberately and to \ndisproportionately impact certain communities--laws that prior to the \nShelby County decision would have been subjected to Department of \nJustice preclearance--I believe more strongly than ever that \npreclearance is necessary.\n  What I was respectfully noting, Senator Collins, without any \nimplications with respect to your motives or integrity, was what I \nbelieved to be an inconsistency, an inconsistency between voting \nconsistently to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and lauding \nit as a signature civil rights achievement, but then voting not even to \nallow debate in this body on the legislation that was created to \nrespond to the Supreme Court's invitation to uphold its preclearance \nprovision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me just note that the Federal \nDepartment of Justice, under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, has \nchallenged the law of the State of Georgia and the State of Texas. So \nthe idea that somehow the Justice Department no longer has authority to \nchallenge laws with which it disagrees or regulations or practices is \nsimply not accurate. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides that \nauthority. It is in effect, and the Department of Justice, rightly or \nwrongly, has invoked it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, I know we have other business to attend to \nand an important debate on a procedure that is ongoing, but I want to \nnote, with respect to my colleague from Maine, that section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act is not the entirety of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Section 4 and section 5, which provide for the preclearance of \nchanges to voting laws in jurisdictions with a history or a pattern of \nvoter suppression, are vital precisely because the post-facto \nlitigation that the DOJ must embark upon to challenge State policies, \nonce they have already been enacted, can be far too time-consuming to \nallow for a remedy to emerge in the courts. This is precisely why \nsection 4 and section 5 were enacted at the time--to give the \nDepartment of Justice the power it needs to preclear these changes in \nplaces with a history of segregation and voter suppression. In my \nState, despite all of the protestations to the contrary, we are, right \nnow, witnessing a significant wave of voter suppression policies.\n  The Department of Justice should have the authority to preclear those \nchanges to law to ensure they don't disproportionately impact minority \ncommunities.\n  So section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is important, but if section 4 \nand section 5 were also vital when we voted to reauthorize them in \n2006, why aren't they vital today?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I promise my colleagues this will be my \nlast comment.\n  This is entirely different from the debate on a 735-page bill. I \nwould invite my colleague from Georgia to review exactly what he said \nearlier this evening.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues from Maine and \nGeorgia for engaging in perhaps the most substantive exchange I have \never witnessed in 13 years here in the Senate.\n  (Applause.)\n  Earlier this evening, one of my colleagues from across the aisle \nsaid: Why are we going down this road? And there have been similar \nquestions: Why is this so important? Why is this bill so important?\n  I will answer simply this: that dark money corrupts elections. If you \nand I donate more than $200 to a campaign, we record it, but if \nextraordinarily wealthy individuals donate hundreds of millions of \ndollars, they can do it with no attribution, corrupting the elections \nacross this country.\n  Gerrymandering corrupts the system of equal representation. From the \nearliest debates in this Chamber, it was recognized that each of us has \na stake in the integrity of the elections in other States so that the \npeople of the United States experience equal representation. We do not \nhave equal representation in the House today, and the gerrymandering \ngoing on now will increase that corruption.\n  Third and most importantly, the power to vote is the most significant \nright, guaranteeing each citizen a voice in the direction of our \ndemocracy. It is the soul of what it means to be a democratic republic. \nThat power to vote is also the most important check in our system of \nchecks and balances.\n  With rigged elections, leaders leaning toward autocracy can keep \nthemselves in power, but with fair elections, undergirded by a free \npress, the people can vote out those autocratic leaders who ignore laws \nand undermine our institutions. It is the most important check in \nmaintaining the integrity of our beloved Republic.\n  Let's go back in time. The rules of the Senate were forged in the \nConfederation Congress experience. Our Founders were engaged, during \nthe time they were writing our Constitution, in participating in the \nConfederation Congress that required a vote of 9 out of 13--two-thirds \nplus a bit--in order to pass any law. It prevented them from being able \nto pay the pensions of our veterans, and it prevented them from raising \nmoney for Shays' Rebellion.\n  Our Founders who participated in that process said: This \nsupermajority has paralyzed our ability to act. With that in mind, they \nwrote our Constitution so that legislation would be passed by a simple \nmajority; that at the end of the debate, when all perspectives were \nduly considered, the perspective favored by the larger number would be \naccepted rather than the perspective favored by the smaller number.\n  So our Founders, leaving nothing to chance, warned us in their \nwritings: Never adopt a supermajority.\n  They said--and I will quote James Madison--that when ``the general \ngood might require new laws . . . the principle of free government \nwould be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule: \n[It would be] the power transferred to the minority.'' He went on to \nsay the result would be ``particular emergencies, to extort \nunreasonable indulgences.''\n\n  Hamilton said many similar things. ``If a pertinacious minority can \ncontrol the opinion of the majority,'' the result will be ``tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible . . . \ncompromises.'' He noted that the ``[supermajority's] real operation is \nto embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the \ngovernment.'' Anyone who has seen the energy drained out of this \nChamber by nothing happening day after day after day when we have \nimportant issues to face can understand just how right the Founders \nwere.\n  So in writing up the guidelines and the vision for the initial \nSenate, our leaders came up with a Senate code, and that Senate code \nwas, hear all perspectives--in fact, guaranteeing in rule IV of the \noriginal rules that every Senator would have the right to speak twice \nto a question.\n  In addition, they put into the rules a previous question just in case \nthey couldn't get the debate to wrap up so they could get to that all-\nimportant vote to determine where the greater number stood.\n  Thomas Jefferson put into the rule book, the manual for the rules in \n1801: ``No one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, \nsuperfluously or tediously.''\n  Hear the debate, consider all perspectives, and take the option the \ngreater number favored.\n  That Senate code endured in a powerful fashion for a very long time. \nIn 1806, Aaron Burr was rewriting the rules, and he said: You know, we \nhave never needed to use the previous question rule in the book because \nwe hear every one, we hear those perspectives, we take a vote, and we \ngo forward. So we don't need the previous question. And it was dropped \nfrom the rule book.\n  When I hear the folks say the Senate never had a simple majority to \nclose debate--they had the Senate code, and they had a rule, and then \nthey said: We don't need the rule because we have the Senate code.\n  That code continued to endure, and the full understanding of the \nMembers of this Chamber was they had no right to prevent the Senate \nfrom getting to a final vote.\n  That code was so powerful that in the mid-1800s, when Senators \nstarted to speak at length in order to make it very difficult to get to \na final vote, the press called it piracy.\n  You may wonder, where did the term ``filibuster'' come from? That \nterm is a corruption of the term ``freebooter,'' the term for \n``piracy.'' The piracy was Senators breaking the Senate code. That was \nthe piracy. But, still, it happened on rare occasion, and the code was \nstretched but not really broken through the 1800s, except on civil \nrights.\n  What happened in our history on civil rights? Well, you had John C. \nCalhoun leading the nullification movement that said: Hey, States don't \nhave to accept any given Federal law. They can choose and pick which \nones they want.\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\n  Initially, that nullification movement was in order to block laws \nthat put tariffs on imported products that strengthened the North and \ncost more funds to the South, increased the prices of goods, but then \nit turned to the question of protecting slavery. Nullification \ncontinued and even went so far as to say States should have the right \nto secede if they don't like those Federal laws. Then we had a civil \nwar over that question, and that was the end of nullification, but it \nwas not the end of attacks on civil rights.\n  So what did we see after the Civil War? We saw a group of States make \nit harder for individuals to register to vote. We saw a group of States \nmake it hard for Black Americans to get public accommodations. We saw a \ngroup of States make it easier to reenslave Black Americans under the \nBlack code, utilizing the slavery clause of the 13th Amendment.\n  Congress responded, the House responded, this Senate responded and \nsaid: No. We are here to defend the Constitution, that every person is \ncreated equal, and every person's rights must be protected.\n  That is what this Chamber, the Senate, did in 1875.\n  The House passed the Civil Rights Act on public accommodations, \nguaranteeing access to all public accommodations for all Americans. The \nHouse voted 152 to 99. It came to the Senate, and the Senate voted 38 \nto 26, a simple majority.\n  Although there were Senators here who desperately hated public \naccommodation bills because it would end discrimination in the South, \nthey did not filibuster because the Senate code said that after all \nviews are heard, you can hold a simple majority vote.\n  The Senate code held, but it didn't hold in 1891. In 1890, Henry \nCabot Lodge, down the hall in the House, introduced what became known \nas the Lodge bill. It said: In order to protect the foundation of our \nNation, there can be Federal supervision upon request to make sure \nregistration is fair, to make sure the voting process is fair, and to \nmake sure the counting process is fair.\n  The bill came here to the Senate, and a bipartisan group filibustered \nthat bill, southern Democrats and western Senators known as the Silver \nSenators. They were anxious to get onto a bill about silver coinage to \nsupport the silver mining in the West. That bill was eventually tabled.\n  In 1891, the Senate code was broken on civil rights and continued to \nbe broken through 1965. In 1922, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Act was \nfilibustered. In 1934, the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching act was \nfilibustered. In 1942, the anti-poll tax bill that put a price on being \nable to access the ballot box--it was filibustered. And on and on.\n  With the exception of a 1-week delay in a bill for arming commercial \nships in 1917, virtually every filibuster denied Black Americans the \nright to vote because in lieu of nullification, there had to be a \nstrategy for certain Senators to make sure that Black Americans didn't \nget their civil rights. That is the sorry chapter of that part of our \nAmerican history. Three generations through it, 1965 paid the price of \ndenying opportunities.\n  The Senate code on every other issue essentially survived until 1971, \nwithin our lifetimes. In 1971, we started to see the filibuster go to \nnot just 1 or 2 filibusters a year but to 12, a dozen--imagine that--\nand in 1974 to 32. That was just so outrageous because each one takes \nup a week, and so this Senate said: That is unacceptable, so we must \nreform the rules. It led to the March 1975 rule reform where they went \nfrom two-thirds of those voting to 60 Members voting.\n  Well, the result is, that law backfired. To quickly look at it, \ncloture on amendments--each one taking up a week--expanded from some 6 \ntimes in the entire decade of the 1960s to 143 times in the 2010s.\n  For a motion to proceed, which is the ability to prevent debate from \never happening--the filibuster to promote debate was used to kill \ndebate on the motion to proceed. It was used 10 times in the 1960s and \n175 times in the 2010s. And, on nominations, it went from once in the \n1960s to 545 times in the 2010s.\n\n  How did it happen that it expanded in the 2010s? Well, it happened \nbecause a Republican minority decided that they were going to obstruct \nas many of President Obama's nominations as possible. And the Democrats \ndid the same thing to President Trump.\n  Each one of these takes up a week, an intervening day, 30 hours of \ndebate, another hour of debate for every other Senator who wants to \nspeak who didn't get to--every single one. So when you have over 100 of \nthese a year, it is impossible to have a Senate that works. The Senate \nhas been broken.\n  And perhaps the top champion of breaking the Senate is the minority \nleader, who has engaged in the tactic of delay and obstruction, arguing \nhe wanted to make sure--his top priority was making sure President \nObama was never reelected, and stopping him from having an agenda and \nstopping him from putting people into office was the strategy. And \nDemocrats took much the same approach to President Trump. So we have \nboth done it, but the Senate is blown up now.\n  In that original Congress, the Senate, the first term, it said there \nwere about four Cabinet members to confirm, plus Ambassadors and some \njudges--four. We have over a thousand positions now. It is completely \nout of sync. The gears don't match.\n  And every time there is a filibuster on a nomination, it is another \nweek lost. So the Senate is now paralyzed because here is the \ninteresting prospect and the unfortunate reality of 60 votes. The \ninteresting prospect is that a majority of less than 60 has to reach \nout to the minority to get something done. And that sounds like it is \ngoing to increase cooperation and negotiation, but the unfortunate \nreality, in our tribal, partisan politics, is the minority looks at \nthat and says: If we can hold 41 Senators from agreeing to close \ndebate, we can paralyze the majority. The overwhelming impact is \nparalysis and accentuation of partisanship of our current filibuster.\n  Today's debate, it is not about filibuster versus no filibuster; it \nis about fixing a broken Senate. It is about the difference, as my \ncolleague from Virginia has said, from the secret, no-show filibuster \nto the public, talking filibuster.\n  Before 1975, people who wanted to extend debate had to actually \ndebate. What a notion. They had to show up. And that is painful and \ndifficult to maintain continuous debate, and so there is an incentive \nto negotiate. But when there is a no-show, no-effort filibuster, where \nthose who say they want to debate are off on vacation because 60 votes \nis required with or without them, there is no incentive to negotiate.\n  So if you believe the Senate should be a place that encourages \nnegotiation, we need a public filibuster, not a secret, silent \nfilibuster. If you believe that the public should be able to \nparticipate in our process, we need not a secret, silent filibuster but \na public, talking filibuster. We are here, day after day, week after \nweek. We are debating the issue. We are raising amendments. We are \nconsidering amendments. And what is the result? The citizens weigh in. \nThey say: Finally, they are considering it. Finally, they are debating \nit. Finally, they are going to take a vote. Now we can weigh in \neffectively in this moment.\n  So this is about restoring, reinvigorating debate, restoring the \npublic role, creating an incentive to negotiate, creating an incentive \nfor both sides to work to reach an accommodation.\n  Now, my Republican friends have made much today of Democrats signing \na letter saying that they are determined to ``preserve the ability of \nMembers to engage in extended debate''--interesting--``preserve the \nability of Members to engage in extended debate.'' To preserve the \nability to engage in extended debate means we need the talking, public \nfilibuster, not the secret, silent filibuster which requires no debate \nat all. So, to my Republican colleagues who signed this letter, this is \nyour opportunity to do what you said. Vote for the principle that the \nmajority leader is going to be laying out forthwith.\n  So, colleagues, if you believe in the Founders' vision of this \nSenate, of hearing everyone and hearing everyone well but eventually \ngetting to a final bill; if you believe in the Senate code, which stood \nup for so long, not even needing a rule to enforce it, except for civil \nrights it held up through 1971; if you want more debate and you want \npeople who want a debate to have to show up to debate, support the \ntalking filibuster.\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\n  If you believe there should be an incentive for both the majority and \nminority to negotiate, support the talking filibuster. If you believe \nthe public should have the ability to see us debating issues, then \nsupport the talking filibuster.\n  My colleagues have said: We must defend the minority leverage. Amen \nto that. That is why, in 2011, I put forward in this Chamber the \ntalking filibuster and said we need to defend the minority's right to \nparticipate.\n  Today, we have another opportunity to defend the minority's \nparticipation, to speak at length for at least twice on any given \nquestion, on through a complex bill. But that, colleagues, depends upon \nending the era of the secret, silent source of partisanship and \nparalysis that we currently have and replacing it with the talking, \npublic filibuster.\n  I encourage you all to stand today for the Senate to work and for the \nSenate, most importantly, to defend the fundamental rights of every \nAmerican to access the ballot box.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for one \nsecond, sir.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Is it possible we can enter into a talking filibuster \nnow without a rules change? Could we start a talking filibuster right \nnow without a rules change?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague from West Virginia, the challenge that \nwe have today is that, in the course of Senate debate, it is never \npossible to get to a debate on the final question. And the proposal \nthat the majority leader is putting forward is saying it is time to get \nto that final debate, and on that final debate every Senator can speak \ntwice.\n  I can tell you, leadership on both sides probably is nervous about \nthe idea of 100 Senators speaking twice, at length, but the single \ninnovation of the talking filibuster is to say that there will be a \nperiod of debate in which we will consider final passage with all four \nof the mechanisms that currently exist, three that were created at the \nfoundation--and that is the break in debate and that is the two-speech \nrule and that is unanimous consent and the 60 votes that was created in \n1975.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I understand. The way this rule reads right now, sir: \nduring which all amendments, motions, and points of order are not in \norder, and any appeal shall be determined without debate. That doesn't \nallow any amendments whatsoever.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The vision, the vision of this----\n  Mr. MANCHIN. That is the way this reads, what we are voting on right \nnow.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Excuse me. Go ahead.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I am saying, that is what we are voting on right now.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. What we are voting on now is to go to final passage with \ncontinuous debate, and the majority leader's team has crafted this to \nensure continuous debate.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. No amendments. No amendments.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. That would be--had we gotten to the bill and been able \nto engage in----\n  Mr. MANCHIN. We didn't have amendments on the bill. No amendments, no \nmotions, no points of order.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague from West Virginia, your question is, \nWhat are the characteristics that define continuous debate on final \npassage? And it is defined as without interruptions that take us in \nother directions than the question of final passage of the bill.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, well, I think we can all agree on one \nthing: It has been a long day. Almost everybody has had something to \nsay, and the reason for that is this is an important day in the history \nof the Senate. It could be argued it is the most important day in the \nhistory of the Senate as an institution. This very day that we are just \nwrapping up is, in all likelihood, the most important day in the \nhistory of the Senate as an institution.\n  This evening, fewer than 60 Senators voted to advance a piece of \nlegislation so it didn't move forward. It is pretty common around here. \nIt happens frequently. In fact, it happened less than a week ago, as we \nknow, when our Democratic colleagues used the 60-vote threshold to \nblock sanctions against Putin's pipeline.\n  In 2020, the Democrats used the filibuster multiple times to delay \nthe CARES Act, kill Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill, block \nbipartisan protections for unborn children.\n  Senate minorities can apply the brakes to small majorities. Senate \nminorities can apply the brakes to small majorities. This institution \nmakes major changes earn major buy-in. This institution requires that \nmajor changes receive major buy-in. For decades, Americans on all sides \nacknowledged this.\n  Believe it or not, 15 years ago--several of us were here 15 years \nago--there were 180 civil rights organizations--180 civil rights \norganizations--that weighed in in support of the filibuster because, at \nthat particular point, the filibuster was being used to stop judges \nappointed by Bush 43. So over 100 civil rights organizations wrote us a \nletter saying the filibuster is indispensable. It served their purpose \nat that particular time.\n  For decades--literally, decades--Senators on both sides agreed. We \nhave quoted each other back and forth here, eloquent filibuster \ndefenses from colleagues across the aisle when it benefited them to \nmake those speeches.\n  But, colleagues, a leader's true colors are not revealed when long-\nterm principles and short-term power line up together. That is easy, \nwhen what you are trying to achieve lines up with the tactics. The \nmeasure of a leader is not what he or she chooses; it is what they \nchoose when those two paths diverge, go in a different direction.\n  Now, half of us, on this side of the aisle, just spent 4 years--4 \nyears--when we were in the majority and we had a President of our party \nasking us to do what they are trying to do tonight, and we had a one-\nword answer: No. No. We are not going to fracture the institution to \nachieve some short-term advantage.\n  And actually, astonishingly enough--Grassley was here then--in 1994, \nthe best Republican off-year election, arguably, in American history \ntook the House for the first time in 40 years, got the majority back in \nthe Senate.\n  Tom Harkin--Chuck Grassley's colleague from Iowa, the Democrat--on \nday one of that session, through the regular order, offered a rule \nchange to lower the threshold to 51. So who would have benefited from \nthat? This brand-new, enthusiastic majority just having swept the \ncountry would have been the principal beneficiary of lowering the \nthreshold to 51. Not one single Republican in the new majority voted to \ngive themselves an advantage that would break the Senate--not one. So \nwe have been consistent on this side of the aisle in support of this \ninstitution as long as I have been here.\n  They face the same decision now. They have a choice. They could break \nthe institution to achieve what they want or defend the institution. \nAnd so they pivoted. And that is why so many of them look so foolish \nbecause they have been on the opposite side of this, not a long time \nago but quite recently. And so they tried to carve out a special \ncategory here that somehow this issue is different from all the other \nissues and should be treated differently.\n  Well, on the merits, as we have discussed ad nauseam here, this is \nsomething they have been trying to do for a long time. The rationale \nfor it has changed periodically, depending upon what seemed to make \nsense. But dial it up any way you choose to, this is a plot to break \nthe Senate--a plot to break the Senate. Over the issue they have \nchosen, one-half of 1 percent of the American people say election law \nis their most pressing concern--one-half of 1 percent of the American \npeople.\n  Actually, Americans, as a number of you have said during the course \nof this long day, believe voting laws are actually too loose, rather \nthan too strict, and as you have said over and over and over again, \nGeorgia's new law is arguably more progressive than New York or \nDelaware. All of you have said that all day long.\n  And this? This is the basis upon which the President of the United \nStates calls people like us racists, traitors? Over this? Over how many \ndays of early voting you are going to have? Really? This is the basis \non which 40-plus Senate Democrats want to not\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\nonly break their word but break the Senate.\n  Now, the so-called talking filibuster proposal is smoke and mirrors, \njust smoke and mirrors. There is really only one question we are \ndealing with here, just one. It is not complicated. Will it take 60 \nvotes to pass massive changes or a simple majority to ram them through? \nThat is what is at stake here, nothing else. Will slender majorities \nneed to build coalitions across the aisle or not? Will huge chunks of \nFederal law reverse themselves whenever gavels change hands? We have \ntalked about this all day long. That is what this is about.\n  But, colleagues, something even more fundamental is at stake tonight. \nEveryone in this Chamber knows that factional fires are burning hot all \nacross our country. As I look around, I don't know if this many of us \nhave actually gathered in this Chamber since January 6 of last year. We \nwere all in here then. I stood up that day, and I said self-government \nrequires shared respect for basic ground rules. I said we couldn't keep \ndrifting into two tribes and delegitimizing the few institutions we \nstill share.\n  Yes, the divisions run deep. Compromise is certainly challenging. But \nit would not serve a divided country if two factions take turns ruling \nover one another with an iron fist.\n  Here is a solution for a divided country: Thoughtful compromise \neverywhere we can agree, and, when we can't agree, it just doesn't \nhappen.\n  The American people are closely divided. We are reflected here with a \n50-50 Senate, for the longest time in American history.\n  There is not a mandate to fundamentally transform America into \nsomething it has never been. It is not what the voters voted for. We \nhave a narrow majority trying to jam through, one after another, \nproposals to fundamentally turn us into something we have never been.\n  Well, here is the good news: The Framers custom built--custom built--\nthe Senate to stop this kind of thing. That is why this institution was \nconstructed in the first place. We are sitting in the place designed to \nstop this kind of thing, and we have an opportunity to do it here \ntonight.\n  This is the first time in history that a Senate majority leader, who \nis supposed to safeguard this institution, has convinced--convinced--\nnearly all of his party to attack the institution. That hasn't happened \nbefore.\n  Tonight, for the first time in history, almost an entire political \nparty will write in permanent ink that they would shatter the soul of \nSenate for short-term power--shatter the soul of the Senate for short-\nterm power. But the brave bipartisan majority of this party is about to \nstop them--about to stop them. We will stop the Democratic leader from \nsilencing the voices of millions upon millions of Americans who have a \nright to be heard in this Chamber, many of them represented by us who \ncome from small States. They derisively look down on us as a flyover \nterritory, a place nobody wants to stop.\n\n  The Senate was designed to represent those people. Every State gets \ntwo Senators. Some States have only one House Member but two Senators. \nWe are here to protect middle America, and the supermajority threshold \nin the Senate makes that even more possible. So they can't run \nroughshod over us. They can't run roughshod over us and the people we \nrepresent.\n  When our country needs leaders to fight the fires of factualism, \nalmost half the Senate over here wants to literally dump more gasoline \nright on top of it.\n  When our institutions needed defending, a sitting President and a \nmajority leader have made smashing the Senate an unofficial part of \ntheir party's platform. The President of the United States and the \nmajority leader of the Senate have made breaking the Senate a central \npart of their plan for America.\n  Thanks to the courageous position of at least a few of their Members, \nthey will not succeed. This country will be shielded from their \nradicalism tonight. And make no mistake about it, this is radicalism \ndesigned to fundamentally change America in every conceivable way, to \nthe disadvantage of virtually all of the constituents represented by \npeople on this side of the aisle--and theirs as well, if they were \nwilling to admit it.\n  So the Senate will be safe tonight. The Senate will be safe tonight. \nAmerica can breathe a sigh of relief. This radicalism will have been \nstopped, and it is a good day for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ``a denial of this sacred right [to vote] \nis a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic \ntradition''--``a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our \ndemocratic tradition.''\n  Those were the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his speech \nwhere he implored the Federal Government--and especially Congress--to \ntake action on a simple request: ``Give us the ballot.''\n  Today, the American people are saying the same thing: Give us the \nballot. Let us not sink into the abyss of voter suppression. Give us \nthe ballot.\n  A few hours ago, this Chamber, with the eyes of the Nation upon it \nand with the evidence of voter suppression laid bare before it, with \nvery little refutation from the other side--they don't discuss the \nissues going on in the States--took a vote to move to final passage on \nthe Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement \nAct. It received 50 votes, and with the Vice President, we would have \nhad the majority. Unfortunately, under the current rules of the Senate, \nthe door is closed to moving forward on these laws--so much part of the \ncore values of our country.\n  But make no mistake, on voting rights, inaction is not an option. \nInaction is not an option. And now, the Senate must rise to the \noccasion. The only way to achieve our goal of passing voting rights, \nending dark money, and ending partisan gerrymandering is by changing \nthe rules because our colleagues from the other side of the aisle don't \nwant to join us in these noble endeavors. This evening, we have \nproposed a modest, one-time change of Senate rules to establish a \ntalking filibuster for this voting rights legislation. It fundamentally \nsays: If you want to block something as sacred as voting rights, you \nmust do it out in the open. You must debate it and show the American \npeople where you stand. You can't sit in your office and block \neverything.\n\n  In short, every Senator will be allowed to speak twice on final \npassage of voting rights legislation. They can speak as long as they \nwant--days, if they can muster it--but all other dilatory tactics, any \ndilatory amendments, motions, and points of order, shall be deemed out \nof order, and any appeal shall be determined without debate. After each \nMember has had their say, it will be time to vote, and only 50 votes \nwill be required for passage.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple, limited proposal, and it only \napplies to the voting rights bill before us today.\n  Now, look, there is no denying that Members of this body have \ndivergent views about whether the filibuster in the 21st century is a \ngood thing or a bad thing. Some have argued that it actually helps \nbring us together--something I don't agree with and which I have not \nseen evidence of, as the eloquent statement by the Senator of Oregon \nhas--we have just seen. But even for those who feel that the filibuster \nis a good thing and helps bring us together, I would ask this question: \nIsn't protecting voting rights, the most fundamental wellspring of this \ndemocracy, more important than a rule in this Chamber?\n  Let me say that again. Even if you think the filibuster is a good \nthing, isn't protecting voting rights and preventing their diminution \nmore important, particularly when this rule was not always in existence \nand was not envisioned by the Founders? That is the key question we \nshould each ask ourselves.\n  To be clear, minority rights are a vital feature of this Chamber, but \nthe Senate was never envisioned to allow an absolute minority party \nveto--never. In fact, the Founders expressly rejected the inclusion of \na supermajority requirement for the Senate. Hamilton called the idea \n``poison.''\n  If there is anything undermining the spirit of the Senate today, it \nis, frankly, the way things work right now. It is time for the Senate \nto adapt, to meet the challenge of the modern age. Robert Byrd himself \nrecognized this truth,\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\nthat Senate rules must sometimes change. And our proposal today is a \nlimited, carefully tailored step we can take to make the rules of the \nSenate achieve this body's original purpose.\n  Finally, there are some who fear the consequences of passing this \nbill with no support from the other party. I would certainly prefer \nthat Republicans work with us on this issue, and voting rights has \nalways been a bipartisan issue in the past. But we must be honest. We \nhave made many earnest efforts to draft and debate bipartisan \nlegislation that deals with voter suppression, dark money, and partisan \ngerrymandering, but those efforts by many Members of our caucus have \ncome up with no takers.\n  The old GOP worked with Democrats on voting rights for decades, but, \nunfortunately, that is not the case today. In the words of the late \nSenator Wagner, whose seat I hold, delivered on this floor nearly 80 \nyears ago:\n\n       Unity in a democracy is not achieved by side-stepping and \n     ignoring issues. That is false unity. That is only the \n     illusion of unity.\n       Unity in a democracy is the unity which is achieved by \n     facing issues, by threshing out our differences, and by \n     standing upon the decision of the majority.\n\n  Again:\n\n       Unity in a democracy is not achieved by side-stepping . . . \n     issues.\n\n  Fittingly, he spoke those words in the face of a filibuster on the \nanti-poll tax legislation.\n  Tonight, let us sidestep voting rights no more.\n  The question before the Senate is, How will we find a path forward on \nprotecting our freedoms in this turbulent 21st century? The only choice \nto move forward on these vital issues is to change the rules in the \nmodest way we have proposed.\n  My colleagues--my colleagues--history is watching us. Let us choose \nin favor of our democracy. Let us stand up and defend the precious \nright to vote.\n\n\n               Motion to Proceed to Motion to Reconsider\n\n  Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked on the motion to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: \nJohn R. Lewis Act.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion \nto proceed to the motion to reconsider.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I make a point of order that for this \nmessage from the House, with respect to H.R. 5746, the only debate in \norder during consideration of the message be on the question of \nadoption of the motion to concur in the amendment of the House; \nfurther, that no further amendments, motions, or points of order be in \norder and that any appeals be determined without debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Following the rules of the Senate, the \npoint of order is not sustained as it is a compound motion that would \nrequire consent.\n\n\n                   Appealing the Ruling of the Chair\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Shall the ruling of the \nChair stand as the decision of the Senate?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 10 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Barrasso\n     Blackburn\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Braun\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Cassidy\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Cramer\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagerty\n     Hawley\n     Hoeven\n     Hyde-Smith\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     Lummis\n     Manchin\n     Marshall\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Romney\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott (FL)\n     Scott (SC)\n     Shelby\n     Sinema\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Tuberville\n     Wicker\n     Young\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Cortez Masto\n     Duckworth\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hassan\n     Heinrich\n     Hickenlooper\n     Hirono\n     Kaine\n     Kelly\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Lujan\n     Markey\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Ossoff\n     Padilla\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Rosen\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Van Hollen\n     Warner\n     Warnock\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays \nare 48.\n  The decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of the Senate.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                            Motion Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed to the \nmotion to reconsider the failed cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, for the information of the Senate, there will be no \nfurther rollcall votes tonight. Senators should expect a rollcall vote \nat noon tomorrow on the confirmation of Holly Thomas to be the U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I close the Senate and do that \nkind of paperwork, I want to just make a few remarks about tonight's \nvote.\n  So while tonight's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate \nDemocrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark \nmoney, and partisan gerrymandering.\n  With no support from Senate Republicans, many of whom deny the very \nexistence of voter suppression, we faced an uphill battle, but because \nof this fight, and the fact that each Senator had to show where they \nstand, we are closer to achieving our goal of passing vital voter \nprotection legislation.\n  We take inspiration from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He kept fighting \nfor voting rights through every obstacle, and we will do the same. We \nwill not quit.\n  Now that every Senator has gone on record, the American people have \nseen who is on the side of protecting voting rights, and it will only \nstrengthen our resolve as we work to ensure that our democracy does not \nbackslide.\n  This vote is another step forward in the long march for universal \nvoting rights. The Democratic caucus pledges to keep working until \nvoting rights are protected for every American.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 5746\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the House \nmessage to accompany H.R. 5746 no longer be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, I rise today to honor a true \nhero from Labette County, KS, Deputy Gabe Vitt. His quick thinking and \nexpertise helped save the life of a woman in a situation only seen in \nmovies.\n  Deputy Vitt was on patrol in Parsons, when he heard over his radio \nthat a woman had been hit by a train. EMS was preparing to respond to \nthe situation like they normally would, but the person calling about \nthe accident disconnected before they could say where the woman was \nhit. By great luck and coincidence, Deputy Vitt was only a few blocks \nfrom the tracks.\n  Realizing that emergency medical services wouldn't be there in time, \nhe rushed to the scene to find a woman with a severed leg. Making use \nof his EMT training from school at Labette Community College, Vitt was \nable to apply a tourniquet which stabilized the woman's leg steady, \nultimately saving her life. After the incident, Deputy Vitt credited \nthat training heavily, describing his heroics as a natural reaction to \nthe situation. Had he not been nearby or received his EMT training, \nthat woman may very well not be here today.\n  I want to thank this brave officer for being so courageous to dive \nheadfirst into peril. As the son of a police chief, I know the risks \nour men and women in blue take on each day. I admire these unique \ncitizens for continually working to ensure our safety. Deputy Vitt has \nshown what true valor looks like, and Labette County is safer because \nof him. I ask now that my colleagues show this same admiration and \nrecognition for Deputy Vitt and that he may stay safe protecting his \ncommunity.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

NORMAN\n\n<bullet> Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate Mr. Stephen J. Norman on his retirement following 45 years \nof work in the community development and affordable housing industry. \nStephen retires from Washington's King County Housing Authority, where \nhe has served as executive director and been an extraordinary asset to \nour State and the greater Seattle-King County region for the last 25 \nyears.\n  Under Stephen's leadership, KCHA has doubled the number of households \nserved during his tenure and charted a path forward with an expansive \nvision of what a public housing authority can be in the 21st century. \nThe authority's housing stock and tenant-based programming now house \nmore than 55,000 individuals, including over 20,000 children. Stephen \noversaw KCHA's designation as one of the first Moving to Work Housing \nAuthorities in the country, a recognition that enabled KCHA to pioneer \nefforts to partner with the education, health, and workforce \ndevelopment sectors to support residents throughout King County.\n  As the former assistant commissioner for Homeless Housing Development \nin New York City, Stephen has always understood the importance of \nservice-enriched supportive housing. I am particularly proud of the \nwork that Stephen has undertaken to expand the HUD-VASH program in King \nCounty, connecting housing and service systems to support our veterans \nwho are suffering the indignity of living outside.\n  Stephen has also been a staunch champion of broadening the geographic \navailability of affordable housing. KCHA has invested heavily in \nworkforce housing, reflecting an ambitious Nation-leading effort to \npreserve existing housing in gentrifying and high-opportunity areas, \nand has pioneered mobility initiatives for families with children \nparticipating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Creating Moves \nto Opportunity Program research has served as the foundation for \ncurrent efforts by the Federal Government to increase geographic choice \nand mobility for households with low incomes. Time and time again, \nunder Stephen's leadership, KCHA's programs have paved the way for \nbroader policy change at the State and Federal level.\n  The host of expansive housing and services programming at KCHA \nreflects Stephen's extraordinary skills in developing cross-sector \npartnerships, even in the most difficult of circumstances. With his \nwit, inquisitiveness, and relentless drive, Stephen has earned the \ncollaboration and respect of leaders across the State and Nation. He \nhas served as the president of the board of directors for the Council \nof Large Public Housing Authorities and was the\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nfounding vice president and current chair of the board for the \nCorporation for Supportive Housing. He has done all of this while \nkeeping a pulse on the national housing landscape as a tireless \nadvocate for expanded Federal support for affordable housing. I know \nfor certain that because of his effective advocacy and vision, today \nmore people in King County and across the Nation have a place to call \nhome.\n  It has been a great privilege to learn from and collaborate with \nStephen over the last two decades. And it is my honor to thank him for \nhis lifetime of dedicated service to people with low incomes in King \nCounty, the State of Washington, and across the entire country. I wish \nhim the very best during his well-earned retirement.<bullet>\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Res. 492\n\n       Whereas, each year in the United States, approximately 700 \n     individuals die as a result of complications related to \n     pregnancy and childbirth;\n       Whereas the pregnancy-related mortality ratio, defined as \n     the number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live \n     births, more than doubled in the United States between 1987 \n     and 2017;\n       Whereas the United States is one of the only Organisation \n     for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries in \n     which the maternal mortality rate has increased over the last \n     several decades;\n       Whereas, of all pregnancy-related deaths in the United \n     States between 2011 and 2016--\n       (1) nearly 32 percent occurred during pregnancy;\n       (2) approximately 35 percent occurred during childbirth or \n     the week after childbirth; and\n       (3) 33 percent occurred between 1 week and 1 year \n     postpartum;\n       Whereas more than 60 percent of maternal deaths in the \n     United States are preventable;\n       Whereas, each year, more than 50,000 individuals in the \n     United States suffer from a ``near miss'' or severe maternal \n     morbidity, which includes potentially life-threatening \n     complications that arise from labor and childbirth;\n       Whereas approximately 17 percent of individuals who give \n     birth in a hospital in the United States report experiencing \n     1 or more types of mistreatment, such as--\n       (1) loss of autonomy;\n       (2) being shouted at, scolded, or threatened; or\n       (3) being ignored or refused or receiving no response to \n     requests for help;\n       Whereas certain social determinants of health, including \n     bias and racism, have a negative impact on maternal health \n     outcomes;\n       Whereas significant disparities in maternal health outcomes \n     exist in the United States, including that--\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\n       (1) Black individuals are more than 3 times as likely to \n     die from a pregnancy-related cause as are white individuals;\n       (2) American Indian and Alaska Native individuals are more \n     than twice as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause as \n     are white individuals;\n       (3) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native individuals \n     with at least some college education are more likely to die \n     from a pregnancy-related cause than are individuals of all \n     other racial and ethnic backgrounds with less than a high \n     school diploma;\n       (4) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native individuals \n     are about twice as likely to suffer from severe maternal \n     morbidity as are white individuals;\n       (5) individuals who live in rural areas have a greater \n     likelihood of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, \n     compared to individuals who live in urban areas;\n       (6) less than \\1/2\\ of rural counties have a hospital with \n     obstetric services;\n       (7) counties with more Black and Hispanic residents and \n     lower median incomes are less likely to have access to \n     hospital obstetric services;\n       (8) more than 50 percent of individuals who live in a rural \n     area must travel more than 30 minutes to access hospital \n     obstetric services, compared to 7 percent of individuals who \n     live in urban areas; and\n       (9) American Indian and Alaska Native individuals living in \n     rural communities are twice as likely as their white \n     counterparts to report receiving late or no prenatal care;\n       Whereas pregnant individuals may be at increased risk for \n     severe outcomes associated with COVID-19, as--\n       (1) pregnant individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 are more \n     likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, receive \n     invasive ventilation, and receive extracorporeal membrane \n     oxygenation (commonly known as ``ECMO'') treatment, compared \n     to nonpregnant individuals with symptomatic COVID-19;\n       (2) pregnant individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 are at a \n     70-percent increased risk for death, compared to nonpregnant \n     individuals with symptomatic COVID-19; and\n       (3) pregnant individuals with COVID-19 are at risk for pre-\n     term delivery and stillbirth;\n       Whereas 49 States have designated committees to review \n     maternal deaths;\n       Whereas State and local maternal mortality review \n     committees are positioned to comprehensively assess maternal \n     deaths and identify opportunities for prevention;\n       Whereas 43 States are participating in the Alliance for \n     Innovation on Maternal Health, which promotes consistent and \n     safe maternity care to reduce maternal morbidity and \n     mortality;\n       Whereas community-based maternal health care models, \n     including midwifery childbirth services, doula support \n     services, community and perinatal health worker services, and \n     group prenatal care, in collaboration with culturally \n     competent physician care, show great promise in improving \n     maternal health outcomes and reducing disparities in maternal \n     health outcomes;\n       Whereas many organizations have implemented initiatives to \n     educate patients and providers about--\n       (1) all causes of, contributing factors to, and disparities \n     in maternal mortality;\n       (2) the prevention of pregnancy-related deaths; and\n       (3) the importance of listening to and empowering all \n     people to report pregnancy-related medical issues; and\n       Whereas several States, communities, and organizations \n     recognize January 23 as ``Maternal Health Awareness Day'' to \n     raise awareness about maternal health and promote maternal \n     safety: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates January 23, 2022, as ``Maternal Health \n     Awareness Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Maternal Health \n     Awareness Day, including--\n       (A) raising public awareness about maternal mortality, \n     maternal morbidity, and disparities in maternal health \n     outcomes; and\n       (B) encouraging the Federal Government, States, \n     territories, Tribes, local communities, public health \n     organizations, physicians, health care providers, and others \n     to take action to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes and \n     improve maternal safety;\n       (3) promotes initiatives--\n       (A) to address and eliminate disparities in maternal health \n     outcomes; and\n       (B) to ensure respectful and equitable maternity care \n     practices;\n       (4) honors those who have passed away as a result of \n     pregnancy-related causes; and\n       (5) supports and recognizes the need for further \n     investments in efforts to improve maternal health, eliminate \n     disparities in maternal health outcomes, and promote \n     respectful and equitable maternity care practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, just a few days before Christmas, on \nDecember 21, President Joe Biden issued a Presidential determination \nwith little fanfare under the Defense Production Act of 1950.\n  The Defense Production Act of 1950 is a Korean war-era law that \nallows the government to accelerate production of critical materials \nand technology. It is the same law that Presidents Trump and Biden used \nto stimulate production of COVID-related ventilators and PPE during the \npandemic.\n  In his memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, Biden noted that: \n``Ensuring a robust, resilient, and competitive domestic defense \nindustrial base that has the . . . workforce to meet the Virginia-class \nsubmarine undersea warfighting mission is essential to our national \nsecurity.''\n  To accomplish that mission, the President invoked DPA authorities to \nexpand the domestic production capability for ``large-scale \nfabrication, shipbuilding industrial base expansion for resilience and \nrobustness, and maritime workforce training pipelines.''\n  As chair of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, \nwhich oversees the Virginia-class program, I strongly support the \nPresident's decision because it is based on both strategic national \ndefense considerations and industrial base demand.\n  Indeed, just a few days after Christmas, the President signed into \nlaw the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which contained \nprovisions my subcommittee authored that are completely aligned with \nthe President's DPA order.\n  Specifically, the new 2022 NDAA added funding for new facility \nconstruction for submarine production, as well as a boost for workforce \ntraining and supply chain development. All of these provisions were \nplus-ups from the Navy's initial budget request last February and based \non our own analysis of strained shipyard capacity.\n  The more consequential issue contained in the DPA, I believe, is its \nfinding that the Virginia program ``is essential to our national \nsecurity.'' That finding is a blaring signal to the Congress and the \nentire country that we need to bolster our undersea deterrent \ncapability to counter aggressive, coercive actions in the maritime \ndomain--specifically, the behavior of both the Chinese and Russian \nnavies that has been overwhelmingly repudiated by the United Nations \nLaw of the Sea Convention, the former in the South China Sea in 2016 \nand the latter in the Black Sea in 2019.\n  In both cases, despite the International Court's scathing rejection \nof both countries' intrusions on protected waters, there is no sign \nthat lawlessness has abated. China's encroachment on territorial waters \nin the Philippines and Vietnam continues, as does its illegal island \nbuilding and militarization of artificial landmasses that the court \ncondemned. In the Black Sea and the North Atlantic, Russian claims to \nsea control and its seizure of Ukrainian naval ships are blatantly in \nviolation of the international rule of law.\n  Madam Speaker, today, China has the world's largest navy, and Putin \nis aggressively increasing the size of his submarine fleet.\n  For the U.S. Navy, what is particularly concerning is the development \nof sophisticated missile technology by both countries that increases \nthe vulnerability of our surface fleet that has been working in \nconjunction with allies like France, Japan, and Australia to reassert \npost-World War II principles of freedom of navigation visibly and \npeacefully. The joint sea patrols in the international waters of the \nIndo-Pacific and Black Sea are a reassertion of principles that, since \nthe end of World War II, have successfully reduced the risk of conflict \nwhile enhancing trade and prosperity.\n  To counter ongoing threats to rule of law, the Biden administration \nhas been diplomatically reconnecting, all throughout 2021, with U.S. \nallies in both regions, as well as reevaluating the highest and best \nuse of limited defense spending. The DPA issued on December 21 is a \nlogical extension of that process. Given the new challenge posed\n\n[[Page H200]]\n\nby missile technology to our surface ships, stepping up production of \nthe Virginia-class program makes perfect sense since those submarines \nare not at risk from even the most sophisticated airborne missiles, and \nthe Chinese and Russian navies know that.\n  Madam Speaker, in addition, last September, the new AUKUS security \nalliance between the U.S., Australia, and the U.K., whose centerpiece \nis the sharing of nuclear propulsion technology for a new class of \nAustralian submarines, is another powerful, tangible statement about \nthe importance of strengthening our joint allied undersea capability.\n  As David Ignatius, a longtime observer of U.S. foreign policy, \nrecently wrote in The Washington Post: ``The AUKUS alliance with \nAustralia and Britain to build nuclear submarines and share other \nmilitary technology might be the most important strategic move'' by the \nU.S. ``in decades.''\n\n  The Biden DPA order last month and the AUKUS agreement last September \nare a powerful, tangible signal by the U.S. to our allies and friends \nwho support a collaborative action to uphold international rule of law, \nwhich is critical to maintaining a peaceful coexistence among the \nworld's nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am an avid \noutdoorsman. In November and December, if I have time, I tend to spend \nit out in the woods, deer hunting. This is a popular passion among many \nPennsylvanians as well as Americans across our great country. Nothing \nbeats those early mornings heading out to the woods in hopes you will \nreturn successful.\n  But our deer are currently threatened by chronic wasting disease. \nThis is a contagious, neurological disease affecting deer, elk, and \nmoose that is always fatal. CWD has been detected in 25 States and was \nfirst discovered in Pennsylvania deer nearly 10 years ago.\n  Working across the aisle, my colleagues and I introduced H.R. 5608, \nthe Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act, which \nunanimously passed out of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  By working closely with stakeholders, we developed a bill to take us \none step closer to better understanding the genetic implications of the \ndisease and developing policies best suited to solve the problem.\n  Specifically, this legislation authorizes $70 million to split evenly \nbetween CWD management and research efforts through USDA cooperative \nagreements.\n  The research funds are authorized to be spent on testing and \ndetecting CWD in live cervids, noncervids, and the environment. \nAdditionally, these funds are authorized for research of genetic \nresistance to chronic wasting disease, sustainable cervid harvest \nmanagement practices, and any additional factors of local CWD \nemergence.\n  The management section authorizes funding for State or Tribal \nwildlife agencies and departments of agriculture based on various \nfunding priorities, including the highest incidences of CWD, areas \ndemonstrating greatest financial commitments to addressing CWD, efforts \nto develop CWD programs and policies, areas of greatest risk of being \nintroduced to CWD, and areas responding to new outbreaks.\n  This bill also includes key education provisions in which USDA, \nState, and Tribal agencies are authorized to develop materials to \ninform the public on chronic wasting disease.\n  Last but certainly not least, H.R. 5608 directs USDA reviewal of the \nherd certification program within 18 months.\n  Madam Speaker, we need all hands on deck to help combat this disease, \nmaintain a healthy deer population, and protect our beloved elk range--\ncertainly, our elk range in Pennsylvania, which is near and dear to me. \nIt is imperative we better understand the transmission of, resistance \nto, and diagnosis of CWD.\n  I am really pleased that, in December, this House passed H.R. 5608 \nwith strong bipartisan support, marking an important step in that \ndirection. Today, we wait for the Senate to take up this time-sensitive \nbill. It is my belief our colleagues in the Senate recognize the \nurgency and the potential negative economic impacts of CWD if it \ncontinues to spread at this rate and work toward its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Sarah \nTyree, a passionate advocate who spent her career fighting for farmers, \nadvocating for rural and urban agriculture, and working to end hunger.\n  Sarah dedicated herself to ending hunger and spent her life working \non issues like promoting nutrition and reforming our food system to \nmake eating locally grown foods more accessible to everyone.\n  After starting her career on Capitol Hill, Sarah worked for the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization and then the Missouri State \nDepartment of Agriculture, helping to establish the Missouri \nConservation Reserve Enhancement Program.\n  Sarah served as vice president of the agricultural consulting firm \nAgriLogic, and then spent the last 15 years of her career at the \nfinancial cooperative CoBank here in Washington, D.C., where she most \nrecently served as vice president for policy and public affairs.\n  Madam Speaker, the impact of Sarah's commitment to agriculture and \nlocal farming cannot be understated. She established a partnership \nbetween CoBank and the D.C. Central Kitchen, which allowed for the \nkitchen to significantly expand their local purchasing power. Her \nefforts helped many farmers keep land that they may have otherwise lost \ndue to the pandemic.\n\n  Sarah was a devoted member of the D.C. Central Kitchen board of \ndirectors for many years, and she served as chair of the board between \n2013 and 2018. In this capacity, Sarah continued her amazing work to \nend hunger and played a major role in securing funding to establish \nD.C. Central Kitchen's new location and expand its reach.\n  Sarah was unbelievably generous in her support of a cause that was \ndear to me, Monte Belmonte's annual march across Western Massachusetts \nto end hunger and to help support the Food Bank of Western \nMassachusetts. She poured her energy into supporting local and national \nefforts to end hunger while also empowering the next generation of \nleaders in combating hunger through her work as a board chairman of the \nCampus Kitchens Project.\n  Sarah never stopped imagining a bigger and brighter future. She \nbelieved in harnessing the power of community to make America the best \nthat we can be, promoting nutrition, supporting local farmers, and \nfighting to end hunger along the way. Sarah approached her work and \nthis life with an open heart and a genuine desire to do good. She cared \nabout improving the lives of others in a touching and rare way and has \nleft an immeasurable impact on this world.\n  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, and all those \nwhom Sarah's light touched, it is my great privilege and honor to \ncelebrate and recognize the wonderful life of the late Sarah Tyree.\n  I want to say that I think I speak for all of my colleagues in this \nChamber when I extend our condolences to her husband and her family. I \nhope that they all get comfort out of the fact that Sarah made such a \ndifference for so many in this country and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, last Friday was a big day for \ninfrastructure in the Philadelphia region.\n  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was in Philly to announce the \nfirst tranche of funding for bridges under the new law, including $1.6 \nbillion for Pennsylvania bridges.\n\n[[Page H201]]\n\n  That afternoon, I got to highlight how funding from the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will improve our regional public \ntransit system, known as SEPTA.\n  Over the next 5 years, SEPTA will receive more than $500 million more \nthan expected. That money will help SEPTA accelerate repair efforts, \nincluding rehabilitation projects, vehicle replacement, and improving \naccessibility of rail and trolley stations.\n  While all of these upgrades are needed, the forthcoming work on \naccessibility is especially important. In fact, it is essential. People \nacross our region rely on SEPTA every day to get to work, take their \nkids to school, buy groceries, go to the doctor, and more. Our \nneighbors should be able to complete these daily tasks without having \nto plan around which station has an elevator to accommodate a \nwheelchair or which stop is easier to get a baby stroller in and out \nof.\n  I am glad the infrastructure funding that Congress and President \nBiden delivered will help get this much-needed work done more quickly. \nOur Delaware Valley residents deserve it.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n\n                     Election Workers are Essential\n\n  Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I rise because we have seen a continuous \nassault on voting rights and election integrity in recent years, pushed \nby partisan operatives, foreign governments and, most disturbingly, \nsome of our own elected officials.\n  Over the weekend, the former President pressed members of his party \nin Pennsylvania to plant more Republican operatives in our election \nsystem in order to influence the counting of votes.\n  The former President said, ``We have to be a lot sharper the next \ntime when it comes to counting the vote. Sometimes the vote counter is \nmore important than the candidate.'' That is just wrong.\n  I will be the first to agree that our election workers are essential, \nbut not because they are supposed to change the results in our \nelections for one political party or another. That is not how American \nelections work. Here, the people decide.\n  This kind of mindset is exactly why it is so important to have people \nof good character trained and ready to execute the duties of poll \nworkers faithfully. Poll workers are the first line of defense for \nensuring the right to vote. They help voters overcome challenges, both \nbureaucratic and physical, at the polls. They also help educate the \npublic about how safe and effective our election system really is.\n  We need more engaged citizens who want to contribute to our democracy \nto get involved and sign up to be poll workers in our communities. I \nencourage my constituents to reach out to their county election \nofficials today to learn more about this unique opportunity to uphold \nour democratic system and help ensure that all eligible voters are able \nto exercise their most essential freedom, the right to vote.\n\n\n            Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Delivers Benefits\n\n  Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, one of the highlights of congressional \naction last year was the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we \nare already seeing the impact in my district, Pennsylvania's 5th, and \nthe greater Philadelphia region.\n  Just before the holidays, EPA Administrator Regan joined me at the \nLower Darby Creek Area Superfund Site to announce that the agency had \ncommitted millions in funding from that infrastructure bill to this \nproject, moving its anticipated completion date up to 2023.\n  At this former landfill, chemicals had leached into the soil and \ngroundwater for decades in the largely minority community of Eastwick. \nThanks to funding from the new infrastructure package, many sites like \nLower Darby Creek will see their cleanup accelerated, and nearly 50 \nadditional Superfund sites will get the green light to be cleaned up.\n  Less pollution, safer communities, and more jobs.\n  I am proud to deliver these benefits to PA-05 through the bipartisan \ninfrastructure law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

He has also furthered transportation policy as \nchairman of the Transportation Research Board's Committee on Pavement \nMaintenance and on the Executive Committee of Road and Paving \nMaterials.\n  Mr. Moulthrop has spent his career encouraging comprehensive pavement \npreservation practices as not only a cost-effective approach to \nmaintaining and preserving our roads, which stretches the Federal \nbudget, but also because they benefit drivers each and every day by \nimproving the quality and safety of our roads.\n  Madam Speaker, I will conclude by recognizing the impact Mr. \nMoulthrop's career has had in increasing the awareness of the value and \nimportance of pavement preservation in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nand States nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott) and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on S. 2959.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Members to support the Supplemental \nImpact Aid Flexibility Act introduced by Senator Smith from Minnesota \nand Senator Thune from South Dakota. The companion bill was introduced \nby the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and the gentleman from \nSouth Dakota (Mr. Johnson).\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of Impact Aid for our \nNation's children. For over 70 years, this program has been critical to \nensuring that schools that serve children connected to Federal lands \nhave the resources to help their students thrive.\n  Unlike most public schools in America, these schools do not receive \nfunding from property taxes from these Federal assets. This means that \nwithout Impact Aid support, because they still have to educate the \nchildren attached to those assets, this means that without Impact Aid \nschools serving the children connected to military bases, affordable \nhousing units, or Native Americans on reservations and many other \ninstitutions would be significantly shortchanged, and therefore, unable \nto offer high-quality education.\n  The need for this program is now greater than ever as our school \ncommunities grapple with a resurgence of COVID-19.\n  In response, Democrats and Republicans worked together in the last \nCongress led by, again, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) \nand the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) to enact the Impact \nAid Coronavirus Relief Act. That bill ensured that during the pandemic \nschools continued to have access to Impact Aid funding that accurately \nreflected their student populations, whether or not those students \ncould accurately be counted as physically in those schools because of \nthe complications created by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Today, we have the responsibility to, once again, join together in \nproviding schools the support and flexibility they need to serve their \nstudents.\n  The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act will go a long way toward \nensuring that all students in this country, no matter where they go to \nschool, will have access to high-quality education.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2959, the Supplemental \nImpact Aid Flexibility Act. This bill would allow school districts \nparticipating in the Impact Aid program to use previously reported \nstudent headcounts on their Impact Aid applications for the 2022-2023 \nschool year.\n  Impact Aid supplements funding for schools and students in areas that \ncollect less in local property taxes due to the Federal Government's \npresence. School districts that receive Impact Aid payments include \nthose with military bases, Indian reservations, and Federal low-income \nhousing in or near the school district.\n  The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a big toll on school districts and \ncommunities across the country. It is especially difficult for \nfederally impacted school districts to calculate headcounts due to \nfluctuations during the pandemic.\n  Headcounts determine how much aid more than 1,000 federally impacted \nschool districts receive. That aid helps pay for staff salaries, \nbussing, technology, and other educational supports and services for \nstudents. This bill ensures the Impact Aid recipients will not be \naffected negatively by the pandemic and temporary falling enrollment \nthat have resulted. This frees up valuable time and resources to help \nstudents, while schools maintain a reliable source of funding as they \naddress the academic, social, emotional, and safety needs of the \nstudents.\n  This bill will have no impact on government spending because Impact \nAid is a discretionary program, and its funding level is established \nthrough the annual appropriations process.\n  The trade association for Impact Aid school districts, the National \nAssociation for Federally Impacted Schools, is strongly supportive of \nthis bill.\n  This bill is similar to the one signed into law by President Trump on \nDecember 4, 2020.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2959, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the sponsor \nof the House version of the bill.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan \nImpact Aid Flexibility Act, S. 2959, which is a companion bill to H. \n6126, which I introduced on December 2, 2021. I thank Chairman Scott \nand Ranking Member Foxx, and her representative this evening, Mr. \nOwens, of the Education and Labor Committee, and the committee staff \nfor accelerating consideration of this important measure which provides \nFederal support to 11 million K-12 schoolchildren across America, and \nwhose passage is very time sensitive, which I will explain in a minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, Federal Impact Aid is our Nation's oldest K-12 Federal \neducation program. Impact Aid has its origins in 1821 when Congress \nfirst authorized support for schools to educate military dependent \nchildren.\n  In 1934, Congress passed the Johnson-O'Malley Act, which extended \nhelp to school districts located at federally recognized Tribal lands. \nCongress recognized that, like military school districts, kids residing \non Native American Tribal lands, which were not subject to State or \nlocal taxation to fund schools, deserved assistance.\n\n[[Page H204]]\n\n  In 1950, President Harry Truman signed into law the statutory \nframework for Impact Aid which still stands today. Impact Aid is an \nimportant statement to communities that host children who reside in and \nare connected to Federal property and facilities, namely, that the \nNation will not force them to bear an unfair disproportionate cost to \npublic education.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district with two of those \nhost communities, Groton and Ledyard, Connecticut. Groton is the home \nto our Nation's oldest Navy submarine base with approximately 9,000 \nsailors and officers who work every day to protect our Nation. Ledyard \nis the town next door where many personnel live. Groton has over 1,000 \nNavy kids, and Ledyard has 850. Ledyard is also the site of the \nMashantucket Tribal Nation, many of whose children attend Ledyard \nschools. Impact Aid is critical to these towns' school budgets.\n  The bill before us addresses an urgent logistical problem with Impact \nAid, that, unless we act, will harm military and Tribal districts all \nacross the country, namely, the obstacle created by COVID, to get an \naccurate headcount of eligible students that must be filed with the \nU.S. Department of Education by January 31, 12 days from now. And that, \nagain, is the time-sensitive urgency this evening. Military and Tribal \ndistricts across the country have reported that COVID restrictions have \nslowed down the paperwork process, and this hindrance will result in an \nundercount, and thus, an artificially low Federal reimbursement.\n  The Impact Aid Flexibility Act will solve this problem in an elegant \nway by simply carrying over last year's student census, thus ensuring \nno Impact Aid district will be harmed financially. This is a 1-year \nfix, the same as the fix the last Congress passed in December 2020, the \nImpact Aid Coronavirus Relief Act, which I sponsored with my Republican \ncolleague, Dusty Johnson of South Dakota.\n  Mr. Speaker, this vote is being watched nervously by school officials \nand military staff all across the Nation, such as Groton school \nsuperintendent, Susan Austin, Ledyard superintendent, Jason Hartling, \nand Miranda Chapman, the Navy School liaison officer at the Groton \nSUBASE, New London, who have worked with the National Association of \nFederally Impacted Schools, and I salute them and all their colleagues \nacross the country for their work raising this issue before Congress.\n  The bill before us has already passed the U.S. Senate unanimously and \nhas the support of the Biden administration. It is a bill that keeps \nthe promise to host communities that a high-quality education will not \nbe denied because of military service or Tribal recognition.\n  I urge the House to pass this bill tonight with an overwhelming vote \nof confidence and thanks for those who wear the uniform of this country \nand our Tribal nations and their families.\n  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, the Impact Aid program represents the Federal \nGovernment's promise to provide school districts with additional \nassistance when property taxes are lower because of the presence of \nmilitary, Federal, or Tribal lands.\n  Every year, affected school districts take count of the federally \nconnected students through a take-home survey.\n  This headcount determines the district's Impact Aid reimbursement, \nwhich can help pay for teacher salaries, technology, and student \nsupport services.\n  Throughout the pandemic, school systems across the Nation have worked \nthrough many challenges to continue serving students. Conducting these \nImpact Aid surveys have been no different.\n  That is why the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act will allow \nschool districts to reuse their FY22 student counts and property tax \ndata when submitting their upcoming FY23 applications at the end of \nJanuary.\n  This additional reporting flexibility will be helpful to many of the \n1,100 federally impacted school districts, including Richmond County \nschools in my district, which serves the great community of Fort Gordon \nand our great base there, a U.S. Army installation.\n  I am proud to support the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act. I \nbelieve that it will provide much-needed assurance for school systems.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Wilson).\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Owens for \nyielding and for his leadership on this issue.\n\n  I rise today in support of the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility \nAct. The pandemic has had a dramatic impact on our school systems and \nthe way students are learning, both in and out of the classroom. Many \nparents have made the decision to homeschool their children due to \nuncertainty around vaccine and mask mandates in schools. With many \nresources of local educational agencies dedicated to fighting the \npandemic, it has also become a burden on them to maintain an accurate \ncount of federally connected students.\n  I am grateful for the bipartisan leadership today of Chairman Scott \nand Ranking Member Foxx, who support this legislation. This bill takes \nproactive measures to ensuring that teachers and students are \nadequately supported when returning to the classroom. By allowing local \neducational agencies to use the same number of federally connected \nstudents that they enrolled on their fiscal year '22 applications as \nthey do fiscal year '23 applications, we can allow them to focus on \nrecovering from the pandemic and serve the children of our United \nStates servicemembers adequately.\n  As a representative of Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina, and \nalso nearby Fort Jackson in Georgia, ably represented by Congressman \nRick Allen, we have multiple beneficiaries of Impact Aid funding. I am \ngrateful to support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act ensures that students and \nschools relying on Impact Aid will not be affected negatively by the \npandemic.\n  Specifically, the bill allows schools to use their previously \nreported headcounts so that services students rely on will continue. \nThis frees up administrators to use their valuable time and resources \naddressing the educational needs of the students.\n  Students in over 1,000 federally impacted districts deserve the \nresources they receive from the Impact Aid program. This aid helps pay \nfor a wide range of services that students rely on from bussing and \ntechnology to educational support services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. 2959, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, Congress has taken historic steps \nto help schools recover from the pandemic because we know that every \nschool and every student and every family has felt the tragic effects \nof COVID-19.\n  However, we cannot fully achieve that goal if we fail to address the \nunique challenges facing schools that serve students connected with \nmilitary bases, affordable housing, Native American reservations, and \nother Federal properties.\n  Last Congress, Democrats and Republicans came together and, as a \nNation, tackled the first strain of COVID-19. We came together to \naddress these challenges and to provide urgent support for Impact Aid \nschools.\n  Now, as we confront a new COVID threat, we must provide the support \nthat federally connected children need under the Federal Impact Aid \nprogram. By providing the support and flexibility in this legislation, \nwe will help ensure that Impact Aid schools can keep their teachers and \nstaff on the payroll, purchase textbooks and learning supplies, and \nkeep the lights on in their classrooms. And this bill will help ensure \nthat hundreds of thousands of students have access to a quality \neducation.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) and the Senator \nfrom South Dakota (Mr. Thune), as well as, in the House, the gentleman \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and\n\n[[Page H205]]\n\nthe gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) for sponsoring the \nlegislation; and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) and the committee \nranking member, Ms. Foxx, as well as the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nAllen) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), for their \nhelp in advancing this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Supplemental Impact \nAid Flexibility Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2959.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution \n8, the yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion \nare postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Jonathan Marquess on his appointment as the Georgia Pharmacy \nAssociation vice president of the Academy of Independent Pharmacy.\n  A graduate of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, Jonathan has \nenjoyed a distinguished career and is well deserving of this \nappointment.\n  He is currently the president and CEO of the Institute for Wellness \nand Education in Woodstock, Georgia, and owns many pharmacies across \nthe State. In addition to owning and managing many pharmacies, Jonathan \nhas served as president of the Georgia Pharmacy Association and vice \npresident of professional and clinical affairs for the American \nPharmacy Cooperative. Jonathan has served as the third, fourth, and \nfifth vice president for the National Community Pharmacists Association \nsince 2017.\n  Jonathan has dedicated his career not only to bettering his patients \nbut also working to improve the lives and practices of pharmacists \nnationwide as well.\n  His illustrious career of service makes him more than suited to fit \nthis role, and we are excited to see what else he can accomplish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, yesterday was the Federal holiday \nhonoring Dr. Martin Luther King, and I accepted the challenge of the \nMartin Luther King family, under the name of Martin Luther King III, \nhis oldest child: No celebration without legislation.\n  So I rise in the middle of the debate and debacle that is going on \nover an ill-fated and wrong policy of the filibuster and cloture to \nread the words of Dr. Martin Luther King that he issued on April 3, \n1968, speaking about having been stabbed by a demented woman and saying \nthat if he had only sneezed, he might not have been there even in 1968.\n  And so he says: ``And I want to say tonight, I want to say that I am \nhappy that I didn't sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have \nbeen around here in 1960 when students all over the South started \nsitting in at lunch counters. And I knew that as they were sitting in, \nthey were really standing up for the best in the American Dream and \ntaking the whole Nation back to those great wells of democracy which \nwere dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of \nIndependence and the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have \nbeen around in 1962 when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to \nstraighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their \nbacks up, they are going somewhere because a man can't ride your back \nunless it is bent. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been here in 1963 \nwhen the Black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of \nthis Nation.''\n  Finally, I want to say that he wanted to make sure that his life was \nnot in vain and that he would be recognized and remembered for the work \nthat he had done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I saw a political crossword puzzle this \nweek. It asked for a six-letter word to describe President Biden's \nfirst year in office. So I thought, divisive? No, that is eight \nletters. Weak? No, that is four letters.\n  But the word is crises, Madam Speaker. From the crisis raging at our \nsouthern border to the economic crisis affecting Arkansans, small \nbusinesses, and Americans across the Nation, the Biden administration \nhas continually failed to address these challenges head-on.\n  The border crisis isn't a seasonal problem, as argued. It is the \ndirect result of repealing the Trump-era border policies and replacing \nthem with absolutely nothing until recently.\n  Federal Reserve Chair Powell says, inflation isn't transitory, Madam \nSpeaker. It continues to rise to a 40-year high. Americans are paying \nmore for just about everything from gas to groceries.\n  Under President Trump, we saw increasing real wages. Under President \nBiden, we are seeing real wages decline, meaning our pay is decreasing \nwhen accounting for inflation.\n  Democrats' solution? Continuing to push their constant tax-and-\nspending spree. We need leadership, Madam Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I rise to express the serious concern that \nour aviation community has regarding the rollout of 5G service. The \nFederal Aviation Administration has warned that potential 5G \ninterference could affect sensitive airplane instruments, such as radar \naltimeters, which would significantly hamper low-visibility operations, \nand so we must delay the rollout of 5G at select airports until we can \naddress all aviation safety concerns.\n  Pilots across America are flying in low-visibility conditions, from \nsnow to sea fog to other zero-visibility conditions, and they need all \nthe instruments and procedures at their disposal so that they can \nsafely protect the lives of their passengers and crew.\n  We cannot and must not compromise on safety. It will be safe to fly \nwhen pilots say it is safe to fly. The United States has the safest air \ntransportation system in the world, and we must continue to safeguard \nthis system.\n  I am thankful that wireless carriers have decided to delay the \nimplementation at key airports, but that does not go far enough. The \nFAA needs to ensure that 5G services will not be implemented at any of \nthe 50 airport locations that have been identified as vulnerable until \nsafety can be ensured.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of John \nRice Irwin, a renowned historian and the founder of east Tennessee's \nMuseum of Appalachia. He recently passed away at 91 years of age.\n  John joined the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany during the \nKorean war. When he returned to east Tennessee, he began a career in \neducation and became Anderson County Schools' youngest superintendent \nat the age of 31.\n  It was around this time John started collecting old-timey Appalachian \nitems. John was fascinated by east Tennessee's rich cultural history, \nand he traveled around the region to collect artifacts and document \nstories of how the people lived long ago. He even bought a historic \ncabin and restored it to what it would have looked like when it was \nfirst built.\n  Madam Speaker, that little cabin became the Museum of Appalachia, \nwhich opened in 1969 and received around 600 visitors during its first \nyear. John kept expanding the museum, and now it covers 65 acres, \ncontains over 250,000 historical artifacts, and welcomes tens of \nthousands of guests each year. Anyone who visits the museum will \nrecognize John's passion for the Appalachian heritage.\n  Former Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander displayed loaned artifacts \nfrom John's museum in his Washington office until his retirement in \n2020. These same artifacts are now on display in my Washington office, \nand I am reminded of John's incredible work each time I walk through \nthe front door.\n  Rest in peace, brother. Thank you for telling the stories of our \nhistoric Appalachian community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam Speaker, I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a \nchild, I was always so proud of Milwaukee. You would look at the crime \nrecords or the crime numbers in the biggest cities around the country, \nand Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with San Diego, year after year had the \nlowest murder rate in the country.\n  It is, therefore, very disappointing to find out that at the end of \nlast year Milwaukee, one more time, set their all-time record for \nmurders, at 197. This is caused, I think, in no small part by \npoliticians who scream racism and cause disrespect for the Milwaukee \nPolice Department, and, therefore, the Milwaukee Police Department has \nto back off and not be aggressive, as Milwaukee continues to become \nmore and more dangerous.\n  I can only hope in the future that politicians looking to make cheap \npoints do not further denigrate the Milwaukee police and do not further \ncause Milwaukee to hit another record this year in total murders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, today, at least on one question, Americans \nare more united than ever before. This week, as we mark the 1-year mark \nof the Biden Presidency, the vast majority of the American people agree \nthat the Biden Presidency has been a failure.\n  After 1 year in office, President Biden's approval rating is the \nlowest ever recorded after the first year in office of any President in \nAmerican history.\n  Why is no mystery. By every measure, Americans are worse off today \nthan when Biden took office. Inflation, crime, the debt, the border, \nAfghanistan, a never-ending pandemic, Americans have endured \nhumiliation abroad and division at home, and all of these disasters are \nman-made.\n  Everyone knows why inflation is at a 40-year high. Everyone knows why \nAmericans' wages have been cut by 3 percent or more. Democrats spent \ntrillions and then passed the largest Federal budget in history.\n  How, in less than a year, did we go from energy independence to \nbegging Saudi Arabia for oil? Well, maybe it has something to do with \nthe President banning new natural gas production in the United States.\n\n  You see, the media wants to make things complicated. They want you to \nbelieve that no one really knows why you are paying close to $4 per \ngallon at the pump. They want to separate the consequences of the last \nyear from its cause. But don't be fooled, Madam Speaker.\n  There is a border crisis because the Biden administration stopped \nbuilding the wall, cut deportations by 90 percent, and reversed every \nsingle one of President Trump's successful border enforcement measures.\n  Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to \n45 because it, too, is pouring across a wide-open southern border. It \nis that simple.\n  Crime immediately shot up after Democrats' antipolice riots, because \nof Democrats' antipolice riots.\n  There are still hundreds of Americans stranded in Afghanistan because \nthe Biden administration didn't prioritize its own citizens for \nevacuation.\n  President Biden's COVID policies do not work. That is why COVID \ncases, hospitalizations, and deaths all rose during the Biden \nPresidency. Americans endured mandatory vaccinations, pointless mask \nmandates, endless school closures, and never-ending Dr. Fauci \ninterviews. And it was all for nothing.\n  Americans can see what is in front of them. That is why they have \nrejected this administration. The proof is in the pudding, and the \npudding is stale.\n  The question is, can Americans endure 3 more years just like the last \none? I believe that they can, but they shouldn't have to. That is why \nthe Republican Study Committee is here tonight. We will hold the Biden \nadministration accountable every step of the way. We will make sure \nthat the past year of crises and catastrophes never repeats itself.\n  Madam Speaker, tonight, I will yield to a number of my colleagues, \nlike the next speaker. The gentlewoman from the great State of Indiana \n(Mrs. Walorski) is going to share some thoughts with us.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, the American people have faced 52 weeks \nof broken promises.\n  The President who promised to unite the American people instead has \npitted citizens against one another.\n  The President who promised to work with Americans across the \npolitical spectrum has prioritized a radical agenda that caters only to \nthe extreme wing of his party.\n  The President who promised to protect the American people has left us \nvulnerable at the southern border and across the world.\n  The President who promised to build back better has only hindered \nAmerica's economic recovery.\n  For a year, we have witnessed failure after failure. The American \npeople have paid the price. Day after day, Hoosiers and Americans \nacross the country experience the real ramifications of the Biden \nadministration's policy agenda.\n  With inflation at a 40-year high, we are paying the price of the \nPresident's reckless spending during every trip to the grocery store \nand the gas station.\n  Despite spending trillions of dollars on the President's so-called \nrescue plan, we are facing escalating supply chain bottlenecks and \nworkforce shortages with no end in sight.\n  Thanks to the Biden administration's open border policy, every town \nacross America is a border town. As illicit drugs pour across the open \nsouthern border, including a 1,000 percent increase of fentanyl last \nyear, every neighborhood is at risk.\n\n[[Page H209]]\n\n  While Democrats work to defund the police, Americans are facing \ndangerous crime surges in cities all across the country.\n  In the end, it all comes down to control. If you don't want to get \nthe vaccine, you are fired. If you dare to ask what your children are \nlearning in school, you are labeled a domestic terrorist.\n  This is America under 52 weeks of Joe Biden's leadership. The \nAmerican people deserve better.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State \nof Indiana for her comments. I know she and I both agree that Hoosiers \nare sick and tired of this leadership, or lack thereof, that we have \nseen from President Biden over the last year.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. \nFoxx), the ranking member of the House Education and Labor Committee \nand a great mentor and colleague.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for \nholding this Special Order tonight and calling attention to the \nproblems of the past year.\n  I could use many words to describe President Biden's first full year \nin office, but the one that comes to mind immediately is incompetence.\n  There is a blueprint for the economic and societal ruin that has \nstabbed America in its back for a year. This administration is the \narchitect of that blueprint.\n  Inflation has skyrocketed to its highest level in 40 years.\n  Job creators have faced innumerable setbacks that have threatened \ntheir livelihoods.\n  The ever-growing Federal bureaucracy has metastasized like a cancer.\n  Parents have been targeted by the FBI and DOJ in what can only be \ndescribed as a wave of new-age McCarthyism that has been spun by this \nadministration.\n  The southern border has all but collapsed due to gross mismanagement.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Simply put, the policies and actions of this administration mirror \nthe agenda of political arsonists.\n  No matter how ambitious or forward-thinking the Biden administration \ntries to bill itself as, it cannot shake the stench of incompetence \nthat surrounds every initiative it heads up.\n  Socialism is no longer an ominous shadow on the horizon. This \nadministration has brought it to our doorstep.\n  This great country must be saved from the ruin that this \nadministration has created.\n  Republicans will be the ones to save it.\n  Republicans will be the ones to safeguard the values and freedoms \nthat have always defined America.\n  Republicans will be the ones to turn this country around and deliver \nfor the American people.\n  When we retake the House of Representatives and the Senate this year, \nthat is precisely what we will do.\n  Americans demand it, and we will act.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, from Indiana to North Carolina to Kansas \nand beyond, the American people are feeling the effects of this \ndisastrous administration.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), my colleague and my \nfriend, a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and a \nleader in the Republican Study Committee.\n  Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, this week we look back over a year of \nfailures; from the economy and crime to foreign policy and national \nsecurity. There is not one area where a year of total Democrat control \nshouldn't receive an F.\n  It is hard to believe it was only a year ago this Thursday that \nPresident Biden swore to uphold the Constitution just outside the \nbuilding from where we stand today.\n  Despite assuring the American people that he sought to unify the \ncountry, Biden's first hours in office were marked by divisive and \ncontroversial executive orders.\n  Biden's incompetent economic policies destroyed our chance at a \nstrong economic recovery and harmed hardworking families and small \nbusinesses.\n  A year later, Americans are paying about 50 percent more each time \nthey fill up their tank. That is after President Biden canceled the \nKeystone XL pipeline, halted new oil and gas leasing on Federal land, \nand proposed burdensome taxes and regulations on small energy \nproducers. These policies all matter. They impact real people.\n  That is why tonight I wanted to share some insight and experiences \nfrom folks in Kansas after a year of President Biden holding office.\n  Nick, a new father in Derby, has certainly noticed the increase in \nfuel. He just had a baby last year and started a new job. Paying more \nat the pump means that he has less for his newborn's needs, and as \nevery new parent knows, diapers aren't cheap.\n  But that is not the only thing Kansans are paying more for.\n  The Biden administration has directly caused rising prices by \nflooding the economy with their Big Government spending. The prices of \nmany other everyday goods like beef, bacon, eggs, chicken, and coffee.\n  That is a lot for any American, but it is especially noticeable for \nNancy, a grandmother on a fixed income. She shared that each time she \ngoes to the grocery store she notices her grocery bill keeps going up.\n  That is not to mention bare shelves and out-of-stock items that many \nKansans have experienced when they go shopping.\n  Beyond the economy, we have witnessed the failure to keep our country \nsafe from illicit drugs flowing into our country at the southern \nborder.\n  Executive orders have halted the production of a barrier at our \nsouthern border, and open border policies have allowed drugs and \ntrafficking to become commonplace. Every State is now a border State, \nas fentanyl makes its way to communities in Kansas and across the \ncountry.\n  CBP reports that more pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern \nborder than in the previous 2 years combined.\n  In a recent survey, a majority of Kansans from my district told me \nthe issues of most importance to them are the economy, rising prices, \nimmigration, and our Federal deficit.\n  It is time for Congress and the President to start addressing these \ncore concerns. Americans cannot afford another year of radical \nsocialist policies with this administration.\n  I thank my good friend from Indiana for hosting this Special Order.\n\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Estes for his comments.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Moore), one \nof our leaders in Congress on the Republican side fighting for veterans \nevery day on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and my colleague and \nfriend.\n  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the 1-year \nanniversary of the Biden administration. And what a year it has been.\n  The crisis raging across our Nation because of the incompetency of \nthis administration threaten the lives and livelihoods of countless \nAmericans.\n  On his first day in office, President Biden gave a taste of what was \nto come by spitefully eliminating President Trump's border policies and \nstopping the wall, fueling a border crisis that we have not seen in a \ngeneration.\n  The drug and human trafficking that we have seen at our porous border \nreaches every community in our Nation. Untold numbers of American \nfamilies who have lost loved ones to drugs and violence, those families \nwill be broken forever.\n  But instead of coming after criminals, Biden's Justice Department has \nfocused its crosshairs on engaged parents--moms and dads--and labeling \nthem just because they had concerns about CRT or maybe mask mandates, \nthey are labeled as domestic terrorists and now are charged with hate \ncrimes.\n  Our economy is in shambles. The Biden jobs deficit, the difference \nbetween jobs created and those he promised to create as part of his so-\ncalled stimulus from March, has swelled to 1.11 million.\n  Historic inflation has surged to the highest level in four decades. \nGas and energy prices are at the highest they have been since the \nObama-Biden administration.\n  The supply chain crisis has brought any economic recovery to a \nstandstill. Have you been to the grocery store lately? Retailers are \nfacing a 12 percent out-of-stock level on many household\n\n[[Page H210]]\n\nstaples. Empty shelves are the new norm.\n  And let's not forget the pandemic. President Biden centered his \ncampaign on having a solution for the virus. It is clear now that like \nevery other crisis we face, Biden has no plan.\n  By resorting to harmful and unconstitutional mandates and shutdowns, \nPresident Biden is threatening the very liberty that is the foundation \nof this great American experiment.\n  And then there is Afghanistan, an issue that is very personal to me. \nWhat the Biden administration allowed to happen there, leaving so many \nAmericans and allies behind to the Taliban is a historic tragedy.\n  But does Joe Biden seek unity? No. He resorts to smearing over half \nthe American people who disagree with his radical agenda.\n  But that is how this leadership of the Democratic Party in Washington \nthinks. They believe that the country is theirs to govern as they wish, \nto force their will on you and me.\n  Well, we have had 1 year of Democratic Party control; and in only 1 \nyear, the Democratic Party has tried to take our country from us. I say \nit is time we take it back.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, as President Biden continues to fail the \nAmerican people in so many ways and his poor leadership has created \ncrisis after crisis after crisis, I can't think of anywhere in the \ncountry that shows us just the opposite type of leadership than the \nfree and open State of Florida.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. \nCammack), one of Florida's great leaders, a freshman leader in the \nRepublican Study Committee, my colleague and friend.\n  Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from the great State \nof Indiana for yielding, and I am still holding out for my honorary \nHoosier title.\n  Madam Speaker, this week we mark 1 year since Joe Biden was sworn in \nas President and Commander in Chief of the United States. Now, there \nare 525,600 minutes in a whole year, and somehow Biden has used every \nsingle one of those minutes to diminish and destroy the strength of the \nAmerican economy, its workers, and our national security. During the \nfirst year of the Biden Presidency, America has faced more COVID deaths \nthan in the prior year, a disastrous exit from Afghanistan of which we \nare still getting Americans out, a 40-year high inflation rate, and so \nmuch more.\n  Now, this country has spent the last year staring down a border \ncrisis that has gone unmanaged and a pandemic that has gone unabated. \nIn 2021 alone, there were over 1.7 million border encounters. Keep in \nmind, the comparison of 500,000 or less the year prior. Now, while our \nbrave border agents were left underresourced and unsupported, this \nadministration first attempted to ignore the crisis then sought to \ndownplay the consequences. The so-called border czar, Vice President \nHarris, refused to visit the border and see this crisis firsthand. This \namounted to criminal negligence, and Americans won't soon forget the \nrole that Biden and his administration played in dramatically weakening \nAmerica's national security.\n  Now, as millions of illegal immigrants poured over our southwest \nborder, COVID continued to sweep through the United States. The Biden \nadministration was caught flatfooted, once again, on testing capacity \nnationwide and distribution of critical lifesaving therapeutic \ntreatments. In my home State of Florida, we had a fantastic monoclonal \nantibody treatment program going, and the Federal Government stepped in \nand stopped it. Why? Because they are threatened by the freedom. They \nare threatened by the success. Over 440,000 Americans have lost their \nlives to COVID-19 under the Biden administration. That is more than \nwhen the pandemic began and the entire year of 2020.\n  Further, images of high gas prices at the pump and empty shelves at \nthe supermarket define the first year of the Biden Presidency. As our \nNation has grappled with a global pandemic, this administration has \nstood on the sidelines while Americans have struggled to get basic \nnecessities. Every sector of the American economy has been hurt by \nsupply chain issues caused in part by abusive Chinese trade practices \nand, also, weak administrative leadership.\n\n  On top of these mounting challenges, the Biden administration has put \nthe entirety of their political capital behind over $6 trillion worth \nof so-called social justice spending bills meant to prop up failing \ngovernment programs and a liberal wish list of items. The economic \ndevastation from so much uncontrolled spending has already been felt in \nhistoric levels of inflation and will certainly be burdening \ngenerations of Americans to come.\n  This administration's first year in office has been a disaster from \ntop to bottom. Instead of working to change positively, Biden has \nworked to change our country into a population of dependents because \nthat is, at the end of the day, what this administration is about: \nDependency and control.\n  We can take our country back, and we will. To Americans hurting in \nthe first 52 weeks of this administration, remember, November is \ncoming.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for her \ncomments.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), one of the \ngreatest voices of common sense in the entire Congress, a senior \nRepublican leader on the House Education and Labor Committee, my \ncolleague, and friend.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as has just been said, I think the first \nyear of this administration has been about as disastrous as it could \npossibly be.\n  I will focus on the COVID pandemic. Over 300,000 people had died when \nPresident Biden took office, nevertheless, things in a way were looking \nup. Donald Trump had been given a combination of monoclonal antibodies \nand several other things in a cocktail in which he was cured just a few \nmonths before President Biden took office.\n  One would have thought all one had to do was follow down the path of \ntreatment that Donald Trump received and it would be the end of the \npandemic. Instead, we are over a year after him taking office, and at \nleast in Wisconsin we don't have enough monoclonal antibodies to deal \nwith the people who are sick today.\n  Even though ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have also shown \npromise, the CDC and NIH under President Biden have not shown a \nleadership role and encouraged more doctors to use them. Vitamin D can \ndo a tremendous job in reducing the number of people who succumb to \nthis disease, but again, a complete lack of leadership out of \nWashington, some people feel a complete lack of leadership because \nthere is not enough money to be made in Vitamin D by the drug \ncompanies.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  We recently had calcifediol imported into this country from other \ncountries, and it has not been anywhere near publicized as it should \nbe. It is time for President Biden to step up, to make sure monoclonal \nantibodies are available to everybody and put an end to the pandemic. I \nhave had my own staffer use monoclonal antibodies, and it turned him \naround from being quite ill within 24 hours just fine.\n  Madam Speaker, it is time to look at things other than just making \nmoney for the drug companies. It is time to solve this problem.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Fitzgerald), my colleague and a freshman Member of the House.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, as we are hearing from many of my colleagues tonight, \nthere is no shortage of policy failures to reflect on as we approach \nPresident Biden's 1-year anniversary. But the one that is still beyond \nbelief and a complete disaster is the cancellation of the Keystone \npipeline project.\n  On day one, just hours after being sworn into office, the President \nhalted construction of the pipeline, bringing down thousands of good \njobs, many of them in my home State of Wisconsin and many of them in my \ndistrict. This decision undermined our country's energy independence \nand destroyed a safe and efficient route to transport oil.\n  Oh, and now Russia is flush with cash as they market their oil around \nthe entire globe. That is right. Killing the Keystone project didn't \njust stop the transportation of oil; it completely\n\n[[Page H211]]\n\nreconfigured the way that this works globally.\n  Listen, while President Biden continues to ignore the negative \nimplications of his agenda, my Republican colleagues and I have been on \nthe forefront proposing solutions--in this case, the Keystone XL \nPipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act.\n  Madam Speaker, after seeing the disaster that President Biden left in \nhis wake after only 1 year, I can only fear what will come in the next \n3 years.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Garcia), a fellow veteran and friend.\n  Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and \nshipmate from Indiana for this evening's Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, we the people really aren't asking much of our elected \nofficials. Above all things, we just want them to do what is right for \nour country and be on the side of Americans. This isn't a party thing. \nThis isn't a Republican versus Democrat thing. Regardless of party \naffiliation, we just want them to do what is right for the country.\n  The current Presidential administration and its policies have failed \nus in this regard and in a frighteningly short period of time. In just \n1 year, this administration and its policies have eroded America's \nstatus as the lone, premier superpower; eroded our energy independence, \nmaking us once again beholden to OPEC, literally begging Middle Eastern \nnations to provide us with more oil; eroded an economy that was \nthriving before COVID and beginning to recover in the midst of COVID, \nand now, we are experiencing inflation that we haven't seen in 40 \nyears; eroded our Nation's security, tucking tail against a group of \nsavages and terrorists in Afghanistan after 20 years of fighting for \nthe right reasons.\n  After almost 2 years of no American deaths in Afghanistan and \nrelative stability in a country that was formerly a breeding ground for \nterrorists, this administration set an arbitrary exit date and backed \nthat date up with absolutely no plan. This admin stranded hundreds of \nAmericans in Afghanistan and left our allies high and dry. The ad hoc \nand sloppy withdrawal led to the death of these 13 precious American \nservicemembers--absolutely avoidable and absolutely the fault of this \nadministration.\n  We are really not asking for much from our elected officials. We the \npeople just want this administration to stop giving hope to the bad \nguys and to start taking care of our Nation, our workers, our jobs, the \nsmall business owners, our children and their education, and to allow \nparents the right to understand what our children are being taught in \nschool, the right to make school choices for our children.\n  We are asking that the administration stop calling parents terrorists \nand start preventing actual terrorists from infiltrating our country. \nWe are asking for secure borders, so we don't see 175,000 human beings \ncome across our border and into our Nation each month without any \naccountability.\n  If you care about the Dreamers, if you care about the potential DACA \nrecipients, like many of us do, then you must first end this man-made \nborder crisis.\n  We are really not asking for much. We just want someone to stand up \nand fight against this ridiculous defund the police movement and make \nour streets safe again.\n  We don't want the cost of goods and supply chain issues to overcome \nour income. We are asking simply that we fairly value the time, the \nskills, and the experience of our workers so that when they work harder \nand provide quality service, they make more money and keep more money. \nWe don't want higher taxes only to see the government at all levels \nsquander our hard-earned money.\n  Madam Speaker, above all things, we just want the President to be on \nour side and to have the backbone to stand up for the good guys. We are \nnot asking for much. We just want this administration to stop giving \nhope to the bad guys.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, thanks to our next speaker, I have been to \nthe border in Arizona and Texas, both during President Trump's \nPresidency and now during President Biden's Presidency. What our next \nspeaker has taught me along the way is the night-and-day difference. \nThe border was under control under President Trump; it is wide open \nunder President Biden.\n  What I have learned and what I have stressed more than ever before is \nthat what is going on at the border impacts my district in northeast \nIndiana every single day.\n\n  Our next speaker is the co-chair of the Border Security Caucus. No \none does more in Congress to highlight these issues and work toward \nprotecting and securing our border than Dr. Brian Babin.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Banks), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. I \nthank him so much for having this very important Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, this week marks 1 year since Joe Biden became \nPresident, and what a lawless year this has been. Never in my entire \nlife would I have dreamed that we would have a President who \nprioritizes criminals and illegal aliens over law-abiding American \ncitizens. But here we are.\n  The reckless policies coming out of this White House and the \nDemocratic Party as a whole have put you and your families in grave \ndanger.\n  It is not hard to see where the left's demonization of law \nenforcement and the decision to gut police department funding has \ngotten us. Thanks to the Democrats, we are now in the midst of a crime \nwave with record-high homicide rates in more than a dozen major cities \nacross this great country of ours. The city of Chicago alone saw at \nleast 800 homicides in 2021, a number that we haven't seen in decades. \nBad policies lead to bad consequences. And folks, we are living these \nin technicolor.\n  More than 100 of our brave police officers were shot in ambush-style \nattacks last year. Meanwhile, we have seen violent criminals released \ninto our neighborhoods to commit more violent crimes.\n  It is happening in my own district in Houston, Texas, in the 36th \nCongressional District, which had its deadliest year in nearly 40 \nyears. In Harris County, 113 criminals were granted bond after capital \nmurder charges in 2021. Yes, you heard that right: capital murder \ncharges.\n  Numerous Harris County citizens have been murdered by repeat \ncriminals out on bail, murders which, tragically, could have been \navoided. Innocent Americans are being hurt and killed by this foolhardy \nDemocrat policy. But accountability starts at the top. Will this crime \nwave be just another crisis to go unresolved in 2022, or will this \nPresident and his party come back to reality and work with us to stop \nit?\n  America is watching.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, when I became the chairman of the \nRepublican Study Committee, which is not just the largest conservative \ncaucus in Congress but the largest caucus overall in the entire United \nStates Capitol, I had to choose someone to lead the Republican Study \nCommittees' Budget and Spending Task Force.\n  For almost 50 years, this task force and the Republican Study \nCommittee has put forth a fiscally responsible balanced budget in the \nCongress to lead the way toward fiscal responsibility. And no one has \ndone a better job of that in my time in Congress than Kevin Hern, a \nsmall business owner from the great State of Oklahoma. He has chaired \nand run this effort well.\n  Over the last year, we put out a budget that we showed to the \nCongress. We could balance the budget in 6 years. That is in stark \ncontrast to what the Democrats and President Biden have done to put \nforth the largest budget that this country has ever seen.\n  I don't just appreciate the leadership of Representative Hern; I am \nproud of the effort he put forward.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).\n  Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for the \nopportunity to speak to everyone tonight.\n  Madam Speaker, this week marks a historic milestone, the 1-year \nanniversary of the Biden Presidency. There is a date in January that 1 \nyear ago has affected all Americans, and that was the election of Joe \nBiden to the Presidency, his taking office.\n  Looking back at the previous 12 months, several words come to mind:\n\n[[Page H212]]\n\nfailure, confusion, disarray, pain, dishonesty.\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues will touch on these and many \nother themes relevant to what has unfolded at the White House since its \nlatest occupant took office some 11 months ago. However, I want to \nfocus on one word that has defined the Biden administration this year, \nand that is ``inflation.''\n  Every single month since Biden took office, inflation has risen \nhigher. In the past 11 months, inflation has reached its highest level \nin 40 years.\n  Most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have never \nexperienced this type of inflation. The last time it was this bad, \n``E.T.'' was showing in theaters. Jimmy Carter, the man largely \nresponsible for those hardships, was a one-term President for this very \nreason.\n  Thanks to the Biden job-killing policies, taxpayers are paying the \nprice. Our economic recovery is stagnant. Our small businesses are \nbeing crushed out of existence. December brought us to a 7 percent \nincrease in inflation over the previous year, a number that American \nfamilies are feeling every single day in their pocketbooks.\n  While inflation is up 7 percent, wages have only risen 4.7 percent, \nmeaning that real wages are actually negative, not positive. Americans \nare paying a whopping $3,500 more for basic necessities than they were \nlast year. For all the back-patting Biden has done for the dismal \nnumber of jobs created under his administration, we are still over 4 \nmillion jobs short of prepandemic levels.\n  This is the Biden economy. Polling proves that inflation is the top-\nof-mind issue for the vast majority of Americans. So you would think \nthat this administration would be doing everything in their power to \nalleviate that burden. Instead, they are focused on flushing the \nmarkets with even more unchecked spending. When will it end?\n\n  The President's dismal approval rating isn't a result of his standing \nwith Republican voters, who haven't liked him from the start. Rather, \nDemocrat and independent voters across the country are voicing their \nstrong displeasure with how poorly our country has been run this past \nyear.\n  We know what works, and we know what doesn't. What the President is \ndoing is only exacerbating the problem, something just about everyone \noutside of D.C. knows.\n  The White House must stop the spending spree, stop imposing \nunconstitutional mandates, and stop pushing radical legislation. The \nbest thing this President could do right now is just get out of the \nway.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma again \nfor his leadership and the important words that he had to share with us \ntonight.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Carl), a \nnew member of the House Committee on Armed Services who is playing an \noutsized role on the Committee on Armed Services as we work hard to \nsupport our troops who need our support more than ever before.\n  Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nBanks), my colleague, for organizing this Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, when my father was a child, he sold newspapers on the \nstreets in Oklahoma City. He was 6, 7, and 8 years old. He would tell \nme stories that they would show up every morning and fight over the \nbest corners because they knew they could sell the most newspapers. \nThat was when we were in the middle of a depression.\n  We are not in a depression today--yet. But yet, we still have \nfighting over those same corners.\n  Today, instead of fighting over the sale of newspapers, they are \nfighting over the sale of drugs, and these are illegal drugs that are \ncoming across our border.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Most people don't realize how potent fentanyl is. Let me give you an \nexample. One grain, one single grain of fentanyl can kill a grown man. \nYou can take two packs of sweetener that you sweeten your drink with; \nthat is enough to kill every member of Congress, House and Senate, to \ngive you some idea of how potent these drugs are. Could you imagine a \n50-pound backpack of it coming across our open borders?\n  My personal observation is these intercity killings are primarily \nagainst minority communities. Where is the outrage for these children \nwhich are our responsibility? They are our responsibility, not another \nperson's responsibility. Our communities are being flooded with illegal \ndrugs being brought in from the left and the right, across our southern \nborders. My Democrat colleagues remain silent.\n  Madam Speaker, I truly believe President Biden cares about the lives \nthat are being lost due to illegal drugs and the violence that is being \nclaimed due to these illegal drugs. But where is he? Why is the \nPresident not being the leader that he was elected to be? We need a \nPresident that is a leader and that will step out there.\n  We have had a full year to address this simple issue. This simple \nissue is the illegal drugs. No one seems to be paying attention. I \npromise you it affects every family. Every family in America that has a \nfamily member or friend that has been affected by this fentanyl needs \nto hear this because we can stop it. We can do it.\n  This is an American issue that all communities should be in an uproar \nabout. There are simple, commonsense solutions to fix this problem. I \nam asking, no, I am begging President Biden to sit down at the table \nand work across the aisle. Let's secure our southern border and stop \nthe flow of these illegal drugs into our community that are killing, \nkilling our kids.\n  Let's build a wall now instead of stopping the wall. Let's build a \nwall now and finally put safety and security back into America. First \nand foremost, our responsibility is the safety of the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, please hear my plea. Now is the time to take action. \nWe need an American leader.\n  Mr. BANKS. I thank the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Carl. It is such a \npowerful statement as we think about the drugs that are flooding over \nthe border, that are impacting communities, destroying families.\n  The lack of attention by this administration to do anything about it \nis appalling to the American people. As they see what is going on at \nthe border, they know the border is wide open. They know that this \nPresident is responsible for the lack of leadership to secure the \nborder that has allowed drugs to flow into communities and affect and \ndestroy so many families across this country.\n  Enough is enough. We call on the President. We ask President Biden to \nstep up to the plate and address this issue so that more families \naren't ruined, and more communities aren't destroyed because of the \namount of drugs and the drug epidemic that is affecting our country.\n  Again, I said in my opening statement fentanyl is now the leading \ncause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Why isn't the President \npaying attention to that statistic and doing anything about it to \naddress it?\n  Madam Speaker, next, I yield to a senior member of the House Armed \nServices Committee, someone who I know has a heart for our veterans, \nsomeone who has served under four Presidents since he has been in \nCongress. His perspective is powerful.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina, (Mr. Wilson), my \ncolleague, mentor, and friend.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. As we reach the one-year anniversary of \nPresident Biden in office, I borrow from the great Ronald Reagan and \nhis extraordinary question during the 1980 Presidential debate and ask: \nAre you better off today than you were a year ago? The obvious and sad \nanswer of thinking Americans is no.\n  Since President Biden took office January 20, American families have \nsuffered under a one-party Democrat rule, destroying jobs. The \ncontinued taxing and spending policies of Biden and Democrats have \ncaused inflation. This situation is getting worse and will challenge \nour children's future, while threatening the savings of retirees.\n  Bidenflation has hit the highest rate in 40 years, and the \nastronomical price increases that come with that affect all of our \npocketbooks. A few examples include, gas is up 56 percent higher than \nover a year ago. Propane, kerosene, and firewood are up 40 percent. \nBeef and bacon are up 19 percent. Chicken is up 10 percent.\n  Compounding this damaging effect, most workers have not received \nwages\n\n[[Page H213]]\n\nthat keep up with inflation, according to The New York Times. Families \nhave actually lost possibly $5,000 in just one year. Also, the December \nJobs Report came in at less than half where economists projected.\n  Since President Biden took office, he has failed to protect our \nsouthern border. Over 1.7 million illegal aliens have invaded, \nbenefiting the drug cartels and benefiting the horror of promoting \nhuman trafficking.\n  Energy independence has been replaced by energy dependence, resulting \nin skyrocketing costs. President Biden's policies worldwide have been \ndisastrous. A feeble response to Putin is putting Ukrainian families at \nrisk of mass murder with already 14,000 people killed; bowing to China \nas it continues the genocide of weaker Muslims; capitulating to Iran as \nit shouts death to America, death to Israel; appeasement of Afghanistan \nleading directly to thirteen American heroes murdered; leaving \nAmericans behind and establishing Afghanistan as a safe haven to attack \nAmerican families with suicide bombers, as we saw claimed this weekend \nat the Texas synagogue.\n  American families have never been at greater risk of attack than they \nare today in American history. The Democrat elite think they are \nsmarter than everyone, and they think Democrat voters and Democrat \nmedia are ignorant to believe $5 trillion in spending costs zero. That \nis a direct quote from the President.\n\n  So I ask the rhetorical and famous question again. Are you better off \ntoday than you were a year ago?\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, last but not least, I yield to the \ngentleman from the great state of Texas, (Mr. Arrington), my friend, \nsomeone who fights so hard for freedom, for families.\n  Mr. ARRINGTON. I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), my \nfriend and colleague from the Hoosier State.\n  Looking back over the last year under the leadership of this \nPresident and single-party rule, for a guy who wants my team to win, my \nteam is not the Republican Party, Madam Speaker. It is the great United \nStates of America. It is my children, quite frankly. Personally, it is \nmy children who I want to inherit the blessings of liberty and \nopportunity in this great country.\n  That is our greatest calling, to hand this country back better than \nwe found it, take on the challenges that face our country, work \ntogether to solve the problems, and make this a better, stronger, \nsafer, more prosperous, more free Nation for the next generation. That \nhas not happened, not even close, not even close.\n  I am disappointed to say that this President and his colleagues in \nthe Democratic Party have absolutely failed our country. I didn't say \nthey were bad people. In fact, there are many of them I would call \nfriend and proudly. As a team elected by the American people to do the \njob I outlined, they have failed miserably. As we say in west Texas on \nSaturday morning after Friday night lights, when we are looking at the \nfilm, the eye in the sky doesn't lie. If you look at the footage, you \nwatch the film, you can't help but see one self-inflicted disaster \nafter another.\n  Madam Speaker, let's start with the tone and the promise to unify \nthis country and its leaders, to usher into this Chamber and to \npolitics and political rhetoric civility and unity. That is a big F.\n  This President, I would say, took more unilateral actions and, along \nwith his Democrat leaders in Congress, have jammed through more \npartisan bills than they have worked together to address the issues \nfacing this country. We are more divided today than we were.\n  If our Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, would actually focus on the things that \nwould be required to prevent another riot on this Capitol, then you \nwould have the Capitol Police and the Inspector General of the Capitol \nPolice saying, we are better prepared than we were a year ago. We are \nactually less prepared today because there has been so much hyper-\npartisanship and so much political weaponization and theater than there \nhas actually been real governing of our great country. So there is the \ntone which is failure.\n  The most important job of the Federal Government is to provide for a \ncommon defense. It is the safety and security of the American people. I \nknow you have heard Chairman Banks. I am sure the remarks today have \nbeen replete with the debacle in Afghanistan and the sadness with which \nall Americans watched that. At the same time that they watched this \nneedless, senseless incompetence, they saw America's credibility slip \nquickly, not only with our enemies but with our allies. I don't know if \nthere was ever a time that the American troops packed up and left with \nAmericans, our fellow citizens, crying out because we left them behind.\n  There is a litany of problems with what happened in Afghanistan. This \nPresident is ultimately responsible. He didn't listen to his advisors. \nPeople died. Our troops, we spent 20 years and trillions of dollars, we \nlost the lives of our sons and daughters in uniform to the tune of \nroughly 2,400. What do we have to show for it besides that \nembarrassment of a withdrawal?\n  I live in Texas. We are at ground zero with respect to the chaos at \nthe border and the record number of people and crime activity and drugs \nthat are powering into our country. This President has been derelict in \nfulfilling his sacred duty to uphold the law, plain and simple.\n  Worse, working with his Democrat colleagues in this Chamber, they \nhave poured fuel on the fire that is burning out of control at the \nborder by saying we will give you more carrots. We will create more \nincentives. We will turn the volume up so that people will come in by \nthe millions with the offer of reparation, with the offer of \ncitizenship, mass amnesty, the ability to vote in our elections.\n  You can't make this up, but this border crisis is real. The American \npeople who live along the border feel like this President and their \ngovernment has given up on them and has failed them. I would agree.\n  With respect to the economy, I know we had a tough job for all \nAmericans and all leaders for both parties to get us up and out of the \nrecession related to the pandemic. For this President and my Democrat \ncolleagues, to put policies in place that incentivize people to stay at \nhome rather than to go back to work, I am talking about enhanced \nunemployment policies. I am talking about welfare expansion without \nwork requirements, actually a repeal of work requirements. To put \nmassive amounts of government spending into the marketplace, it is no \nwonder that we are seeing runaway inflation in every corner of our \nmarketplace and in every good and every service that our working \nAmericans depend on.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  The majority of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck have lost \nalmost $400 a month on account of the real wage decrease because of \ninflation, self-inflicted, one after another, and the state of the \nUnion is more fragile now than ever. It is less hopeful than it was 1 \nyear ago.\n  I don't see any posture of change or relenting on the horizon from \nthis President, even with these startling statistics and facts that are \nlaid out plainly for everybody to see. I am not bashful to give blame \nor credit to either side when it is due, but this is a one-party rule. \nWe haven't even talked about the crime spree, we haven't talked about \nthe promises made and broken with respect to COVID, the authoritarian \nmandates in one breath and action and in another breath saying that we \nare going to work together and defer to States, this isn't a Federal \nsolution. I am confused. I am concerned.\n  I have got to say 1 year in review is bleak and dismal. I don't say \nthat with partisan glee, I say it with tremendous sadness and with \nprofound grief over the opportunities lost in a backslidden country \nwhere we can do so much better. We have done better together. \nRepublicans don't have all the answers. I don't have all the answers. \nBut this has not been the great, strong, and constructive leadership \nthat our Nation has seen in the past from, quite frankly, from both \nparties.\n  So I hope and pray, Madam Speaker, that this President will hear not \nmy voice but the voices of the American people, the voices who cried \nout from the will of the people in Virginia where the We the People \nwave has begun, and that we will make changes, and that he will focus \non the real needs; he will stop placating the left, which seems to\n\n[[Page H214]]\n\nbe the MO and has been for the last year, and start focusing on the \npriorities that are important to the American people and to working \nfamilies: safer neighborhoods; a secure border; strong, effective, and \nrespected military and law enforcement; real growth; real \nopportunities; real wage increases like we saw when we cut taxes; and \njust a better quality of life and better hope over the horizon for our \nchildren.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Banks for allowing me to be a part of \ntoday's Special Order.\n  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend for so many \nimportant comments that he and the others have shared with us today as \nwe mark the 1-year anniversary mark of President Biden taking office as \nthe current President of the United States.\n  Once again, this President ends his first year in office with the \nlowest approval rating of any President in American history. The \nAmerican people are feeling the decline of America. They see it, and \nthey hate it because they know it doesn't have to be this way. They are \ncrying out for leadership. They are begging the party in power--the \nDemocratic Party that controls the Congress and owns the White House \nunder President Joe Biden--to do something about inflation, because \nthey feel it and see it every day when they go to the grocery store. \nAnd they beg the Democratic Party to do so something about it. They are \nbegging President Biden to address inflation, the worst inflation of my \nlifetime.\n  They are baffled why the party in power and this President are \ncompletely tone-deaf to the needs of the American people as they suffer \nthrough this disastrous set of consequences of the policies of this \nPresident.\n  Madam Speaker, you heard a lot tonight about the effects of the COVID \nlockdowns and policies that have hurt our kids in schools and have hurt \nso many working Americans as they feel the pressures of these lockdowns \nand the failed policies of this administration. You have heard a lot \ntonight about the effects of fentanyl and the drugs that are coming \nover the wide-open border because of the failed border policies of this \nPresident.\n  You have heard a lot tonight about the embarrassment that Afghanistan \nhas caused the American people on the world stage. The American people \nknow that when we put America's interests first in our foreign policy, \nthe world is safer and better off. But under this President, America is \nless safe from North Korea to the Middle East, China and Russia, all of \nthese countries are seizing on America's weakness under President \nBiden's leadership, and the world is less safe because of it.\n  Madam Speaker, I call on the Democratic Party and President Biden to \nstep up to the plate. America can't afford to suffer another 3 years of \nwhat they have suffered through over the last year.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President and the Vice President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

She served as a Michigan \nState legislator and a Detroit City Council member before being elected \nto the United States Congress in 1990.\n  During her tenure in the U.S. Congress, Congresswoman Rose-Collins \nadvocated for food and agriculture policies to assist communities with \nfood insecurity.\n  She was a fierce defender of human rights in Detroit, across the \ncountry, and abroad. She dedicated her career to making our community \nstronger and our country better.\n  Please join me in recognition of Congresswoman Barbara Rose-Collins' \nmany years of dedicated public service as we honor her memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                   Congregation Beth Israel Shooting\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I begin the substance of my \nremarks, I want to offer a few words in reaction to the terrible \nhostage situation this weekend in Texas.\n  Saturday's hostage crisis at Congregation Beth Israel was a \nhorrifying reminder that the ancient poison of anti-Semitism continues \nto this day. I am relieved that all of the hostages made it out alive, \nand I commend the quick thinking of the first responders and of Rabbi \nCharlie Citron-Walker, who acted valiantly, and all those present for \nbringing this crisis to an end.\n  Moving forward, we must get to the bottom of what inspired the \nterrorist attack on Saturday but increase our vigilance against all \nforms of anti-Semitism and racially motivated violence.\n  Here in Congress, we must continue working to increase our investment \nin nonprofit security grants to groups that are targets of hate. We \nneed to give our communities the tools they need to protect themselves \nso they can live without fear of being targeted for just who they are.\n  On this day, I stand in solidarity with the congregation of Beth \nIsrael, the Jewish community of Greater Dallas-Ft. Worth, and with all \nJewish Americans for whom Saturday's attack was a traumatic reminder of \nthe hate we have yet to overcome.\n\n\n                             Voting Rights\n\n  Mr. President, this is on defending democracy. The eyes of the Nation \nwill be watching what happens this week in the U.S. Senate.\n  Just a few days removed from what would have been Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.'s 93rd birthday, the Senate has begun debate on the Freedom \nto Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act--for the \nfirst time, the first time in this Congress.\n  Democrats have tried for months to hold a voting rights debate on the \nfloor, but we have been blocked each time by Republicans. We brought \ncommonsense proposals four times on the floor of the Senate and only \nonce did one Senator--Lisa Murkowski, to her credit--agree to even \nbegin debate on voting rights. On all three other votes, not a single \nRepublican joined us. Every one of them voted to block even a debate on \nvoting rights.\n  So, today, we are taking this step by using a message from the House. \nNow, it is just a step, but an important step moving forward, in that \nwe will finally debate this one issue that is so central to the \nAmerican people, to our history, and to our democracy.\n  As we debate these measures, the Senate will confront a critical \nquestion: Shall the Members of this Chamber do what is necessary to \npass these bills and bring them closer to the President's desk?\n  Today, we have just taken the first steps that will put everyone--\neveryone--on the record. Much has been said over the past few days \nabout the prospects of passing voting rights legislation in this \nChamber. Senate Democrats are under no illusion that we face difficult \nodds, especially when virtually every Senate Republican--every Senate \nRepublican--is staunchly against legislation protecting the right to \nvote.\n  But I want to be clear. When this Chamber confronts a question this \nimportant--one so vital to our country, so vital to our ideals, so \nvital to the future of our democracy--you don't slide it off the table \nand say, ``Never mind.'' Win, lose, or draw, Members of this Chamber \nwere elected to debate and to vote, especially on an issue as vital to \nthe beating heart of our democracy as voting rights. The public is \nentitled to know where each Senator stands on an issue as sacrosanct as \ndefending our democracy. The American people deserve to see their \nSenators go on record on whether they will support these bills or \noppose them. Indeed, that may be the only way to make progress on this \nissue now, for the public to see where each of us in this Chamber \nstands. The public deserves to see it, and that is exactly, precisely, \nwhat the Senate is going to do this week.\n\n  Make no mistake about it. Using Dr. King as an inspiration, Democrats \nwill continue to fight on this issue until we succeed, and I believe \nhistory will vindicate us.\n  Mr. President, the fight over voting rights is as old as the Republic \nitself. Recently--well, let me say, when the Republic was founded, in \nmany States you had to be a White male Protestant property owner to \nvote. As is obvious by who is in this Chamber, we have made progress--\ninexorable progress--in expanding that franchise.\n  History does not regard those restrictions that occurred early on as \nworthy, but we must continue the fight. We have not reached the place \nwhere every person can vote easily and openly and honestly. So we have \nto keep it up.\n  I have been reading the biography of Ulysses S. Grant by Ron Chernow. \nThe No. 1 thing the southern segregationists wanted to take away from \nthe newly freed slaves was the right to vote. Segregationists back then \nknew that if recently freed Black slaves didn't have the right to vote \nin the South, they would have no power at all: no power over laws, over \nresources, over the future of the country. And that was the No. 1 thing \nsegregationists wanted to prevent: the right of the newly freed slaves \nto vote.\n  It is why, a century later, Dr. King made a direct appeal to Congress \nfor acting on voting rights: ``Give us the\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nballot,'' he said in 1957, ``and we will no longer have to worry the \nfederal government about our basic rights.'' ``Give us the ballot'' and \nall other rights will follow. With the ballot, he argued, voters could \nend the worst of racial segregation. They could elect good men and good \nwomen to government. They could subdue the dangers of the mob and keep \ndemocracy alive. But the ballot had to come first. The ballot had to \ncome first.\n  Dr. King might as well have been speaking to us, because across the \nUnited States, in 2022, ballot access is not being expanded; it is \nbeing repressed. And our democracy is not safe; it is under attack.\n  A year ago, a violent mob incited by the President and his Big Lie \nattacked this very building in order to reverse the results of a free \nand fair election. Last week, for the first time, the Department of \nJustice announced sedition charges against a number of the rioters who \nwere here that day.\n  A year later, at least 19 States have passed 33 laws that make it \nharder for people to vote, using the Big Lie--the Big Lie, as false as \nit is--as a justification. Those States together are home to 55 million \nAmericans, and new laws are certainly coming once the State \nlegislatures return to session this year. And the kind of violence--the \nthreats of violence--we saw on January 6 by that insurrectionist mob is \nnow being threatened increasingly against countless election workers \nacross the country.\n  Just this weekend, the Houston Chronicle reported that ``County \nofficials in urban areas across the State [of Texas] say they've been \nforced to reject an unprecedented number of mail ballot applications \n[thanks to the new Republican voter suppression law.]\n  And this past Saturday, Donald Trump once again repeated the same \nconspiracy theories about the 2020 election that have paved the way for \nvoter suppression at the State level.\n  So, unfortunately, the dangers that face our democracy are alive and \nwell, and the laws that suppress the vote at the State level are being \nenacted on a partisan basis.\n  We have seen periods of regression, in terms of voting rights and \nequality and fairness to people of color. We have seen regression \noccur. And this seems to be a period of regression in what the \nlegislatures are doing, and fight it we must.\n  So the Senate must act. We must step in and act. We must do \neverything to pass voting rights legislation, just as this Chamber has \ndone in the past, just as the Constitution permits us to do. That is \nwhy we will vote this week on the Freedom to Vote Act and the John \nLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And if Republicans choose to \ncontinue their filibuster of voting rights legislation, we must \nconsider and vote on the rule changes that are appropriate and \nnecessary to restore the Senate and make voting legislation possible.\n  As I have recounted already, these laws are urgently needed. We must \nnot--we cannot--allow another period of that regression, which we have \nseen throughout American history.\n  Here is what some of the laws would do--our two laws would do:\n  They would set basic commonsense standards for all Americans for \naccess to the ballot as well as restore preclearance provisions that \nwere passed by this Chamber for decades on a bipartisan basis. They \nwould establish clear and consistent standards for early voting across \nthe country and make it easier for voters to access absentee ballots. \nThey would protect election workers from unlawful intimidation. We are \nseeing so much of that now. It is disgraceful--disgraceful. They would \nend the toxic practice of partisan gerrymandering, and they would take \nnew steps to fight the power of dark money corroding our elections. \nSenate Democrats repeatedly tried, over the last year, to bring \nRepublicans to the table to debate these issues.\n  I will remind my colleagues that this is not the old Republican \nParty. I would remind the American people how dramatically the \nRepublican Party has regressed. The Republican Party used to be one \nthat supported voting rights. Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and \nGeorge W. Bush worked to renew voting rights bills.\n  No, sadly, unfortunately, this is Donald Trump's Republican Party. \nAnd it is the one now trying to take away the vote from younger Black \nand Brown, elderly, minority, and low-income voters.\n  And yet every time we try to engage our Senate Republican colleagues, \nthey resist it. So we have no choice. We are moving ahead on our own.\n  Once again, no one denies the path ahead is an uphill struggle. \nRepublicans have been clear, they will entertain no bipartisan \ncompromise on voting rights, but long odds are no excuse for this \nChamber to avoid this important issue.\n  Again, Members of this Chamber were elected to debate and to vote. We \nare going to vote. We are all going to go on the record. And \nRepublicans will have to choose which side they stand on--protecting \ndemocracy or offering their implicit endorsement of Donald Trump's Big \nLie.\n  For months, Senate Republicans have come up with excuses and \nsubterfuges to avoid doing what they know is the right thing, just like \nso many others have come up with similar lame excuses and subterfuges \nin the past. But as history shows, doing the right thing will \neventually prevail. Justice will flow like mighty waters, as the \nProphet Amos has said.\n  The direction of voting rights in America is enough to have shaken \nthe faith of even the most optimistic champion of America--of \ndemocracy. Sometimes it seems like for each step forward, the country \ntakes two steps back, but fights like this are not unusual in American \nhistory.\n  The story of our country has been a long, arduous march toward \nexpanding the promise of freedom for all Americans. We find ourselves \nin such a struggle today.\n  Dr. King had simple, powerful advice for his followers during moments \nlike this: Keep moving. Keep fighting. The road to justice is often \npainful and full of setback, but we must keep moving. We must keep \nmoving, he said, against every obstacle and prodigious hilltop and \nmountain of opposition. Let nothing slow you down. And even after you \ncross the Red Sea only to find yourself in the desert, just keep moving \nforward through the wilderness. ``And if you will do that with \ndignity,'' he said, ``when the history books are written in the future, \nthe historians will have to look back and say, `There lived a great \npeople.'''\n  We will keep fighting in the same spirit to protect our democracy in \nthis day and age. And if we do that, I have faith that one day the \nhistory books will likewise look back at this generation of Americans \nand conclude, ``There lived a great people,'' too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lujan). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Congregation Beth Israel Shooting\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the remarks of our distinguished \nmajority leader, and I know it comes from the heart because what he is \nsaying publicly, he has also always said both publicly and privately. \nAnd I also join with him in the condemnation of the attack on the \nsynagogue this weekend.\n  I know, in my State of Vermont, the faith community--the Jewish, \nProtestant, Catholic--all came together with prayers for the safety of \nthe people in the synagogue. But more than just the safety of what \nhappened then, let us pray, all of us, whatever faith we have, that \nsuch attacks do not continue in our country.\n  We have seen too many attacks against people based on their religion \nor based on their race or based on their country of origin. That is \nwrong.\n  In this country, in this country, especially--I was thinking of this \nwhen I led the Senate this morning in the Pledge of Allegiance, and I \nthought, ``[O]ne nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and \njustice for all.'' Well, it is a constant battle to make sure that we \nhave liberty and justice for all, and we have to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

We have got to stand up and \nsay people can vote. I remember being here and present when the Voting \nRights Act was signed by President Reagan, President George H. W. Bush, \nand President George Bush. I remember the pleasure on their face, the \nlook of everybody around them, Republicans and Democrats, applauding \nthe President for signing that legislation.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  Why did they applaud? Why did Republicans and Democrats applaud? \nBecause we had all voted for it because we all believed in a person's \nright to vote.\n  You know, I am the only Democrat ever elected to the U.S. Senate from \nthe State of Vermont, and I remember my first two elections which were \nquite close. Ninety percent--I would say approximately 90 percent of \nthe election machinery, those who count the ballots and whatnot, were \ncontrolled by Republicans.\n  But I had faith in getting through because I knew two things: One, \nthey could count and, two, they were totally honest.\n  And I am sure--especially in the vote in my first election, for the \nvast majority who voted for my opponent, an honorable person, they were \nhappy to have counted the ballots, and the State said where the ballots \nwere. And there was even a recount in my second election, it was so \nclose.\n  And I remember one of the Republican auditing groups sent out a \nfundraiser, saying we have to fight the Democratic-controlled election \nmachinery of Vermont. And I reminded them that the ``election \nmachinery'' was 250 town clerks, 80 to 90 percent of whom were \nRepublicans.\n  And I say again: They can count, and they are honest.\n  We are fortunate in our State that we encourage everybody to vote. \nAnd I remember when the Senators of the other party and the Judiciary \nCommittee said: Well, you want--you want to change the rules so that \nDemocrats would win.\n  I said: We want, nationally, the kind of rules we follow in Vermont. \nAnd, by the way, in last year's election, we elected a Republican \nGovernor and a Democratic Lieutenant Governor. Why? Because our rules \ndo not favor one party over the other. Our rules favor one thing--the \nright to vote. And we insist on that in our State of Vermont, but we \nshould insist on that throughout the country.\n  It should not be a case where somebody can be blocked from voting \nbecause the voting booths and the places for them are changed so that \nsome communities would have a harder time or a more difficult time to \ncome there or hours change. No. We should be fighting.\n  If we want America to be the strong, great Nation that we all claim \nit is and we all believe it is and we all want it to be, it can only be \nif we say make sure everybody gets to vote--everybody. I don't care \nwhom they are voting for, make sure everybody can vote.\n  Because what happens when people are blocked from voting and voting \ndrops off, people lose faith in their government. If we lose faith in \nour government, we lose faith in our country. And if we lose faith in \nour country, this wonderful experiment in democracy--as some called it \na couple hundred years ago--fails.\n  We can't have that. We can't have that. So I look back on my 48 years \nhere in the Senate, and I think it is not the title; it is not the \nchairmanships; it is not the President pro tem; it is not being dean of \nthe Senate that I cherish, it is knowing that I can vote. I can vote. I \nhave voted 17,000 times, more than that now.\n  Can I go back over all those votes and find some where I might think, \n``Gee, I should have voted differently,'' of course, I can, but I \nvoted. I can vote. And I call on my colleagues, vote up or down. I \nwould hope that all of us would do as we have in the past, when I have \nbeen in the Senate, when we passed the Voting Rights Act 98 to zero. \nRepublican Presidents were signing the Voting Rights Act. Let's go back \nto that time.\n  Vote any way you want in a Presidential election. Vote any way you \nwant in gubernatorial, congressional, in local elections, but in this \nbody, this body, which should be the conscience of the Nation, vote to \nuphold the right to vote, vote to allow every American the ability to \nvote.\n  Don't hide behind procedure. Stand on the floor, have the courage and \nthe honesty to say: I am going to vote to allow people to vote or I am \ngoing to vote not to allow people to vote. But stand here and say what \nyou are going to do. The last time, 98 of us stood here and voted. We \nwanted everybody to vote. Republicans and Democrats, we joined \ntogether.\n  Wouldn't that send a wonderful signal to a fractured nation if we did \nthat today and stood up and said: We are going to vote. We are all \ngoing to vote. We are going to vote yes or no, but we are going to let \npeople of our State know how we voted. We are going to let the American \npeople know how we voted and say why we voted.\n  I would wish we voted as we did before to say to all Americans, \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, any part of this country: We want \nyou to vote. We will urge you to vote the way we would like, but we \nwant you to have the ability to vote, even if you are voting for our \nopponents or for a different point of view.\n  The most important thing, as Americans, as U.S. Senators, is to say \nwe stand for the right of people to vote--every one of us, every single \none of us.\n  I will have more to say on this matter later.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, yesterday, we celebrated Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., Day and honored civil rights leaders who fought against \ninequality and sacrificed so much to move our country closer towards \njustice for all. But this year, on a day when we should be coming \ntogether to commemorate these civil rights achievements and recommit to \nthe road ahead, we are instead fighting a battle we thought was won \ndecades ago.\n  In 1957, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``Give Us the \nBallot'' address, where he said:\n\n       The denial of this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the \n     highest mandates of our democratic tradition.\n\n  But here we are in 2022 fighting back against hundreds of bills \nintroduced in States across the Nation clearly intended to make it so \nmuch harder for certain people to vote.\n  Twenty-two States have already enacted 47 new laws that make it more \ndifficult to vote by mail, that make it harder to stay on voting lists, \nthat limit the availability of drop boxes for ballots, that limit the \nnumber of polling locations, that impose stricter or newer voter ID \nrequirements, and the list goes on. But one of the most insidious is \nGeorgia's law which allows any person to challenge the rights of an \nunlimited number of voters to cast their ballots.\n  If someone decides for whatever reason to challenge another person's \nright to vote, the voter then has to show up to their election office \nto defend themselves. Imagine being a single mom working two jobs and \nunable to afford childcare, and now she has to defend her \nconstitutional right just because someone thought she shouldn't be \nvoting at all.\n  Volunteers are already being recruited to pose these challenges. This \nisn't voter protection; this is vigilantism. These laws are clearly \nintended to target communities of color and make it harder for them to \nvote, period.\n  Our country's legacy of racial discrimination in voting is \nundeniable, and it is undeniable that we are witnessing history repeat \nitself.\n\n  In 1890, the House passed historic legislation that would have \nincreased voting protections, particularly for Black voters, but the \nSenate failed to take up this legislation, failed to act at a critical \ntime when it had the chance, and the results were devastating for \ndecades to come. The Senate's failure to take up this legislation \nallowed Jim Crow and the plummeting of voter\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nturnout among Black voters to continue for more than half a century, \nuntil the Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 over 70 years later.\n  A recent Washington Post analysis said that this current wave of \nvoter suppression bills potentially amounts to ``the most sweeping \ncontraction of ballot access in the United States since the end of \nReconstruction.''\n  Today, these attacks on our freedom to vote are taking us back to the \ntime of Reconstruction.\n  We cannot wait another 70 years for this so-called deliberative body \nto act, which is why we need to pass comprehensive voter protection \nlegislation. But not a single Republican supports the Freedom to Vote: \nJohn Lewis Act. Many of my Republican colleagues have joined \nCongressman John Lewis to commemorate the March from Selma to \nMontgomery, but today they won't even allow the Senate to consider \nlegislation named in his honor and have called this bill radical. There \nis nothing radical about protecting a person's freedom to vote. What is \nradical is sending us back to the days of Reconstruction.\n  This legislation would restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act, \nwhich Congress reauthorized with broad bipartisan support five times--\n1970, 1975, 1982, 1992--and it passed 98 to 0 in 2006, which included \n10 currently sitting Senate Republicans.\n  This bill would also expand opportunities to vote, prevent voter \nsuppression, and improve election security. We are talking about \nprovisions that would require States to offer early voting and no-\nexcuse vote-by-mail, make election day a public holiday, crack down on \nvoter intimidation, and require postelection audits. Again, I ask, how \nis any of this radical? What is radical is justifying overt attacks on \nour democracy by perpetuating the Big Lie of mass voter fraud.\n  For Republicans, this fight isn't about election security; it is \nabout securing their power, because Republicans have decided that \nspreading misinformation and rigging elections by preventing people \nfrom voting is the only way they will retain their power.\n  Republicans should come to the Senate floor and tell the American \npeople why they won't protect our freedom to vote. Instead, the \nRepublican leader came to the floor to attack Democrats for fighting to \nchange Senate rules to pass this critical legislation, calling it a \npower grab.\n  The Republican leader said that Democrats want to ``permanently \ndamage this institution.'' He went on to say the filibuster is ``about \ncompromise and moderation''--this from the Republican leader who refers \nto himself as the grim reaper as he prevents dozens of House-passed \nbills from being considered on the Senate floor; the same person who \nsinglehandedly prevented President Obama from filling a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court for over a year, denying the will of nearly 66 million \nAmericans who voted to give President Obama a second term in office; \nthe same person who pushed through President Trump's Supreme Court \nnominee as over 159 million Americans were in the process of voting. So \nmuch for compromise and moderation.\n  Let's not pretend this is about the sanctity of this institution. We \ncannot sit back and let one political party continue to unravel the \nthreads of our democracy one voter suppression bill at a time. While \nRepublicans do nothing to protect our freedom to vote in the face of \nmass voter suppression bills enacted across the country, we Democrats \ncannot sit back and let 2020 be the last free and fair election in our \ncountry.\n  If we don't protect the right to vote, we won't have a democracy. It \nis that simple. That is the reality. Since the Republicans will not \nlift a finger to protect voting rights, we have no option but to change \nthe Senate rules in order to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis \nAct. This is something that every single Democratic Senator needs to \nget on board with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, late last week, our Democratic \ncolleagues briefly paused their quest to destroy the Senate's 60-vote \nthreshold just long enough to use the 60-vote threshold themselves to \nblock a bill.\n  Republicans supported sanctioning the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline that \nwould give Russia even more leverage to bully Europe. Most of our \nDemocratic colleagues bowed to the furious lobbying from the Biden \nadministration to protect Putin's pipeline. There were 55 votes to pass \nthe bill that our friends, like Ukrainian President Zelensky, \ndesperately wanted passed, but Democrats blocked it by denying 60.\n  Now, many of these same colleagues have spent weeks thundering--\nliterally thundering--that the Senate's 60-vote threshold is an \noffensive tool of obstruction, a Jim Crow relic, declaring that simple \nmajorities should always get their way. Ah, but late last week, they \nliterally wielded the 60-vote threshold themselves--a useful reminder \nof just how fake--fake--the hysteria has been.\n  We already knew Washington Democrats didn't have any principled \nopposition to Senate rules. Democrats repeatedly filibustered the CARES \nAct in March of 2020, while insisting on changes. Democrats \nfilibustered and killed Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill.\n  You only have to go back a few years to read vigorous defenses of the \nfilibuster from our Democratic colleagues and their allies.\n  The Democratic whip, Senator Durbin, put it this way:\n\n       We need to protect the right of debate in the Senate, \n     preserve checks and balances so that no one party can do \n     whatever it wants. We need to preserve the voice of the \n     minority in America.\n\n  Dick Durbin.\n  The Democratic leader himself said in 2017 that we need to ``find a \nway to build a firewall around the legislative filibuster''--build a \nfirewall around the legislative filibuster.\n  Then, in a letter that same year by 32 Senate Democrats, our \ncolleagues demanded--demanded--that the 60-vote threshold stay right \nwhere it was.\n  Until the last couple of years, Senators on both sides have \nunderstood the Senate is not here to rubberstamp massive changes by \nthin majorities. This institution exists to do exactly the opposite--to \nmake sure major laws receive major buy-in and have major staying power, \nand, historically, Democratic allies outside this Chamber have \nrecognized this as well.\n  Let's go back about 15 years ago when Republicans controlled the \nSenate. A leftwing organization called The Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights published a lengthy statement defending--\ndefending--the filibuster, including--listen to this--its relationship \nto civil rights.\n  Here is what they had to say when Republicans were in the majority \nhere in the Senate:\n\n       On behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \n     nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human \n     rights coalition, with more than 180 member organizations, we \n     urge you to oppose--\n\n  oppose--\n\n     any efforts to eliminate the 216-year-old filibuster in the \n     United States Senate.\n\n  That is a coalition of 180 member organizations called The Civil and \nHuman Rights Coalition.\n  They went on.\n\n       The elimination of the rights of the minority as embodied \n     by the filibuster is contrary to the founding fathers' vision \n     of the Senate as a body of equals designed to protect against \n     the tyranny of the majority.\n\n  This statement continued.\n\n       The civil rights community has recognized and accepted the \n     value--\n\n  The value--\n\n     of the filibuster even when it frustrated efforts to advance \n     civil rights legislative goals. During the 1950's and 1960's, \n     countless civil rights bills were filibustered. The Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 was not passed until it survived 75 days \n     of the longest filibuster in history and the Senate voted 71-\n     29 to end debate and finally passed the bill. This \n     legislation was enacted because of long, hard work\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\n     to build support across partisan, ideological, and regional \n     lines. We worked to bring Americans together--not to push \n     them farther apart.\n\n  They concluded:\n\n       We never demanded the end of the system of checks and \n     balances. In the end, we won the battle by changing votes and \n     not--\n\n  Not--\n\n     by breaking the rules.\n\n  These were leftwing activists writing less than 20 years ago.\n  So let's spell this out. Democrats want the American people to \nbelieve the filibuster was not a Jim Crow relic in 2005; it was not \neven a Jim Crow relic in 2020; just miraculously became a Jim Crow \nrelic in 2021; briefly stopped being a Jim Crow relic last Thursday, \nbut it is now back to being a Jim Crow relic this week.\n  Now, to be clear, the partisan election takeover bills that Democrats \nwant to ram through this week are not--not--in any way successors of \nthe civil rights legislation from the mid-20th century. It has been, is \ntoday, and will remain illegal to discriminate against voters anywhere \nin America because of their race--period. That is the law now.\n  Targeting Americans' online speech and sending government money to \npolitical campaigns is not about civil rights. It is about tilting the \nplaying field. Weakening wildly popular voter ID laws and making it \nharder to produce accurate voter rolls is not about making voting \neasier; it is about making cheating easier. Changing the laws so that \nour partisan Attorney General can rewrite voting laws without even \nhaving to win in court is not about promoting justice; it is about \nshort-circuiting justice. This is about one party wanting the power to \nunilaterally rewrite the rule book of American elections.\n  Now, interestingly, the Biden administration staff has gone out of \nits way lately to highlight my--my--long, strong record on real civil \nrights and real voting rights. The President's Press Secretary \nexplained that I have ``a pretty strong record of supporting voting \nrights.'' She is right about that. And that is exactly why I have no \npatience--none--for the unrelated partisan takeover that some Democrats \nare trying to rebrand with that banner.\n  The Democratic leader argues that his proposed elections takeover and \nhis efforts to break the Senate are last resorts because of new State \nlaws that passed in 2021. He says it is irrelevant that 2020 saw record \nturnout and--listen to this--94 percent said voting was easy because \nthis debate is exclusively about what happened in 2021. But Democrats \nhave been pushing these same policy charges in the same Chicken Little \nrhetoric since 2019, a year and a half before 2020 election, which \nDemocrats now call a high-turnout success.\n  The Democratic leader gave an interview claiming that evil \nRepublicans were trying to attack voting and disenfranchise people. Of \ncourse, when Democrats went on to win the White House, the 2020 \nelection went from presumptively illegitimate to exemplary and \nunquestionable overnight. Around the same time, mid-2019, Senator \nSchumer began floating a nuclear attack on Senate rules. It is \ncompletely untethered from the elections issue. He just thought \nbreaking the rules would make for a livelier stint as majority leader.\n\n  Washington Democrats have wanted the power to rewrite the rules for \npolitical speech and election laws long, long before the events that \nare supposed to justify it, and the Democratic leader's effort to break \nthe Senate long predates the latest pretext.\n  We have strong disagreements about the substance of these bills, but, \neven more broadly, we see decreasing trust in our democracy among both \npolitical sides. We have a sitting President of the United States \nshouting that U.S. Senators are on the side of Bull Connor and \nJefferson Davis for refusing to shatter the Senate.\n  Was the Senate created to make these kinds of factional fevers worse \nor to help break the fevers? Does the Senate exist to help narrow \nmajorities double down on divisions or to force broad coalitions to \nbuild bridges?\n  This fake hysteria does not prove the Senate is obsolete. It proves \nthe Senate is as necessary as ever.\n  Republicans have supported this limitation on the majority's power \nboth when we have been in the minority, which these rules protect, and \nwhen we have been the majority, which they inconvenience.\n  And last week, some of our colleagues across the aisle reconfirmed \nthat they have the courage and the principle to keep their word and to \nprotect the institution as well. But too many of our colleagues across \nthe aisle still want to respond to a 50-50 Senate with a rule-breaking \npower grab.\n  Voting to break this institution will not be a free vote or a \nharmless action, even if their effort fails. An unprincipled attempt at \ngrabbing power is not harmless just because it fails. Voting to break \nthe Senate is not cost-free just because a bipartisan majority of your \ncolleagues have the wisdom to stop you. It is amazing that our \ncolleagues are this in thrall to radical activists.\n  We have inflation, a pandemic, rampant violent crime, a border \ncrisis, and possibly a war on the European continent. But rather than \nwork on any of that, Senate Democrats want to march their own legacies \nwith a reckless--reckless--procedural vote they know will fail. A \nfaction this desperate for unlimited short-term power is a faction that \nmust be denied it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, I care about the future of this \ninstitution, but right now, I care more about the future of our \ndemocracy. Our country has been the bedrock for democracies around the \nworld. It has been the gold standard by which other countries wishing \nto achieve transparency and validation of their governments, have asked \nus to come and witness their elections.\n  Let's not forget what is great about a democracy. The power rests \nwith the people. And when you have an election, it is the people who \nhave spoken.\n  So whether it was F.D.R. and the New Deal, or Ronald Reagan declaring \n``Morning in America,'' the people had spoken, and the country went \nabout the change that was implemented because of free and fair \nelections.\n  Trust me, there are countries who are jealous of this. They obviously \nrun their countries by other means. They are less stable, and they are \nless egalitarian. And yet, if we think of the many great advantages of \na democracy, nothing says it better than the people have spoken.\n  Yet now, we have a former President of the United States, Donald \nTrump, who has dared to say and continues to say the people haven't \nspoken. Donald Trump is not just like the guy at a football game who \ndoesn't like the referee's calls. Donald Trump has taken it to a whole \nnew level of basically, without evidence, saying his team didn't lose \nthe game.\n  Can you imagine an NFL or college football structure where the coach \nsays, ``I don't like the ref's call. My team didn't lose the game. And \nI'm going to spend the rest of my time going, marching around to every \nfootball game and every community saying my team didn't lose the \ngame.''\n  Well, thank God college and professional coaches know better. They \ndon't do this. And yet former President Trump keeps saying, I don't \nlike the call of election officials, judges, Federal courts, never mind \nthere were 60 decisions by different courts. I am going to protest the \noutcome of this election.\n  Never in the history of our country do I know a major race where \nsomeone declared they really didn't lose. What if everybody went around \nsaying, I really didn't lose? What if our system of governments would \nbe affected by that?\n  Well, it is getting to that level of absurdity. The Republican \nnominee in the 2020 Washington gubernatorial election lost by over \n600,000 votes. Yet he claimed voter fraud. He lost by 56-43. And even \nthough he lost by such a huge margin, he claimed voter fraud. He sued \nthe secretary of state, who happened to be a Republican, in King County \nSuperior Court. He only dropped the election fraud lawsuit after the \ncourt threatened his lawyer with making meritless claims.\n  Do we really understand this danger, the danger of people in our \ncountry, to\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nour economy, to our way of life if these falsehoods continue? We are \nnot here, though, just because a former President cannot accept an \nelection loss. He began sowing these seeds of distrust into our \nelection system the minute he stepped onto the national stage.\n  We are here because the problem has become so serious that people are \nnow trying to disenfranchise the voting rights of our fellow Americans. \nSome voter suppression tactics are being put in place because some \nbelieve the former President did not like the outcome of the election.\n  I want to be clear. There are people on both sides of the aisle that \ndo believe in free and fair elections. There are Republicans in key \nelection positions who stood up to the illegal tactics of the President \nwhen he tried to change the outcome of the last election. But what our \ncountry can't afford right now is the continuation of Trump-think to \nallow to erode the voting rights of our fellow Americans.\n  Voting rights have been hard fought and hard won. I know the \nPresident presiding understands this--first by women in 1920, then, \nlater, protecting minority groups in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act. \nIn 1970, we updated it, making standards helping to regulate \nPresidential elections--in 1975, saying we had to protect minorities. \nBoth sides of the aisle agreed to this. And in 1992, we expanded it for \nbilingual education requirements. That passed with 75-20 votes. And \nagain in 2006, the last time the voting rights was updated, we were in \na similar situation. The Supreme Court had two cases and struck down \npart of the act, and we all came together to renew and reaffirm the \nconstitutional protections for people in the United States of America. \nIt passed 98-0.\n  There is nothing wrong with the John Lewis Voting Rights law before \nus. There is nothing wrong with the John Lewis Voting Rights law before \nus.\n\n  It is a bill with bipartisan support that tries to maintain, I think, \na Federal minimum assurance that States don't suppress the rights of \nour fellow Americans. When Martin Luther King was fighting this fight, \nhe said, ``one man, one vote.'' He knew that this was about making sure \nthat everybody had a chance to vote.\n  The John Lewis Act is a continuation of those rights in upgrading \nsomething that has been upgraded numerous times since 1965. That is why \nmy colleagues Senator Manchin and Murkowski called for bipartisan \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, a bipartisan call for \nreauthorization last spring of the Voting Rights Act. They said, \n``Inaction is not an option.'' They continued to say, ``Congress must \ncome together just as we have done in the past time and time again to \nreaffirm our long-standing bipartisan commitment to free, accessible, \nand secure elections.''\n  And that is what we must do now. That is why there are 150 businesses \nwho support the John Lewis Act--companies like Microsoft and Google, \nIntel and Tesla, Target, PayPal. These are companies who know and \nunderstand, they want to do business in a democracy. As Tim Cook said, \nthe right to vote is fundamental to our democracy.\n  American history is a story of expanding the right to vote to all \ncitizens, and Black people in particular have had to march, struggle, \nand even give their lives for more than a century to defend that right, \nand we support efforts to ensure that our democracy and our future is \nmore hopeful and inclusive than the past.\n  There are others--Best Buy--an election cannot be free or fair if \nevery eligible voter is not given a fair chance to vote or if the law \nmakes it harder to do so.\n  Now, I disagree with my colleague who was just on the floor because \nthere is a lot of demeaning of the system. I am not going to spend a \nlot of time on this now because I have another segment here on the \nfloor later, but I come from a vote-by-mail State, and I am proud of \nwhat our State has accomplished. So I do not appreciate the \ndisinformation of Newt Gingrich when he says, ``The biggest way with to \nexpand voter fraud is to expand vote-by-mail.''\n  He is wrong. If I could slash a red line and a red circle through \nthis now, I would do so. But I will spend many minutes later on the \nfloor talking to people why vote-by-mail is part of the solution and \nnot the threat that he thinks it is.\n  Companies know that when it comes to our economy, we are greatly \naided by being in a democracy, and that is why they don't want it \neroded. It will cost us if we are a less stable place to do business. \nSo why now do people refuse to engage on the John Lewis Voting Rights \nAct?\n  You know, I might be one of those people who would say, ``Don't \nchange the filibuster rule, we can wait.''\n  Wait? Wait? For what? What are we waiting for? Our Capitol was \nattacked. We were attacked. People defending us were killed. For what? \nFor what? A big lie, a big lie about our election.\n  I sat outside the Capitol on January 6 and listened to the President \ntelling these lies I knew weren't true. I knew what he said wasn't \ncorrect about our voting laws because I know and understand them, and I \ncertainly know vote-by-mail. But he said many lies that now many court \ndecisions have all said are not true.\n  But the point is that Donald Trump and his followers keep following \nand they tell the people the election wasn't fairly decided, and now, \nthey are trying to pass State laws eroding our constitutional rights to \nprotect every American's ability to vote, and some here don't want to \nact.\n  Our democracy is under threat, and people are trying to undermine the \ncredibility of our elections, and you don't want to act. Trump \nsupporters are literally trying to hoist a Jolly Roger flag over our \ndemocracy because they lost the election, and some people don't want to \nact. Some percentage of the Republican Party now believe that the \nelection was wrongly decided, and some people don't want to act.\n  We have to have faith in close elections, and the best way to do that \nis not to suppress the vote but encourage and empower more people to \nvote in a safe and secure manner. We need to believe in our voting \nsystem, not believe that we can undermine it.\n  Democracies don't grow on trees. They need to be protected. They need \nto be defended. They need to be fought for. And with all the challenges \nwe are facing--COVID, a changing economy in an information age, global \nmigration, climate change--I am getting too many questions from my \nconstituents about whether we are becoming a fascist nation.\n\n  Why am I answering those questions? Because Trump told a big lie and \nhe got people to attack our Capitol and now he is ramping up fear and \nanxiety to the point where locals are changing their election laws and \neroding our democracy? No, I can't stand by. I will vote to proceed and \nchange. I will not stand by because my parents taught me better.\n  My father fought in World War II and reminded me constantly when I \nwas growing up that if someone's rights were eroded, you better stand \nup because if you don't, they are coming after your rights next. And a \nthreat to one was a threat to all.\n  My mom worked at the polls on election day. When she was a child, she \nplayed in her backyard and met an African-American woman who became her \nfriend. When election day rolled around, my mom noticed that her friend \nhad to wait outside in the cold to vote, where the White voters got to \ngo inside and wait. My mom took her friend by the hand inside the \npolling place and said, ``My friend's not waiting outside.''\n  It earned my mom the nickname ``Little Eleanor'' after the First Lady \nof the period.\n  What might seem surprising is how much my mom liked her fellow \nRepublican precinct committeemen. She felt like they were on the same \nteam--Team Democracy: people who got the vote out. They may not agree \non who they were voting for, but they agreed people should vote. And \nthey were willing to live with the consequences. And believe me, my \nparents had a lot of--a lot of things that they had to keep fighting \nfor, but they believed in democracy.\n  I remember my mom saying how uneasy she felt when she realized her \nfriends and neighbors, seeing the results of her precinct, didn't \nsupport John Kennedy for President of the United States.\n  My parents were crushed when John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., were all assassinated, but they never lost \nfaith in\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nthe system, and they never said the system was rigged.\n  What we need to do now is to protect our democracy. We need to pass \nthe John Lewis Voting Rights Act. We need to say, as Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., said, that one man, one vote is what our country stands for, \nand it is the strength of our Nation.\n  One thing about January 6 that bothers me the most--it bothers me the \nmost because I think about my father and his brother. My father quit \nhigh school to fight in World War II because his brother was already \nmissing or in a POW camp. He knew he had to join the fight against the \noppressions, the tyranny, the fascism that existed. He knew he had to \njoin the fight to uphold the democracy of the United States.\n  This is a picture of what it looked like to be escorted back into \nthis chamber on January 6. All I could think of when I saw this picture \nis, obviously, yes, support and gratitude for the military who \nsupported us. But all I could think about was my father and his brother \nwho fought in World War II for these rights, to uphold a democracy, so \nthat I could stand for election and that my friends and neighbors could \nvote for me, and then I would come here in an environment where I was \nfree to walk into the Capitol at any moment and cast a vote on behalf \nof the people that I represent.\n  And yet, on one fateful day, that all changed. And we were no \ndifferent than some other country who had to use military force to \nsupport our democracy here in voting. That is not the way it is \nsupposed to be. That is not what we are fighting for. Many Americans \nhave fought to uphold the democracies of our Nation. The least we could \ndo is pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The least we could do is \nwork in a mission together to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and \nshow that our country believes in holding these important values of a \ndemocracy as utmost important. Let's vote to get this done. Let's move \nforward to show our country we believe in voting rights in the U.S \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Democrats have shamelessly alleged \nthat a massive Federal takeover of elections is needed because of \nquestions some Republicans raised after the 2020 election, so I come to \nthe floor today to show that this whole argument predates the 2020 \nelection.\n  (Mr. BOOKER assumed the Chair.)\n  This Democrat reasoning is despite the fact that their proposal \npredates the 2020 election. The bill that they want us to pass is a \nproduct of concerns that the Democrats had about the 2016 election \nbeing stolen from Hillary Clinton--also because of the 2018 elections. \nAnd, in fact, the Democrat proposal was designed specifically to double \ndown on false claims that Democrats lost certain elections in 2018 only \nbecause of rigged elections.\n  I have said it before, and I want to say it again: Evidence-free \nclaims of voter suppression are as bad as election-free claims of voter \nfraud. Both voter fraud and discrimination in voting is illegal. Any \nclaim of voter fraud or violation of voting rights should be resolved \nin our independent court system with evidence that can stand up in the \ncourts.\n  And as I have mentioned before, the claims by some Trump supporters \nthat a certain brand of voting machine-switched votes was lifted \nentirely from the Democrats' 2004 playbook. And you may remember that \nDemocrat House Members challenged the electoral vote count of whether \nGeorge W. Bush was officially and honestly reelected. And President \nTrump's questioning of his loss in Georgia was simply following in the \nfootsteps of the losing Democrat candidate for Governor of that State \njust 2 years before who lost by a much bigger margin and never admitted \nthat defeat.\n  That makes me wonder if Democrats' professed outrage comes from a \nsincere concern for Democratic reforms or if they are just upset that \nPresident Trump stole their playbook.\n  If Democrats really want to preserve Democratic norms, they would not \nbe proposing the Federal Government overturning the current electoral \nprocess in all 50 States, on a purely partisan basis, with no attempt \nto even hear out Republicans' legitimate concerns.\n  The bills that we are talking about this week are being called \ndemocracy reform. Does democracy need reform? I support the American \ndemocratic system. It does not need a fundamental rewrite. The 240-year \nhistory of our great country under this Constitution ought to support \nthat. It works, and it deserves our support. We should not denigrate \nAmerican democracy for short-term political gain.\n  President Trump's candidacy in 2016 brought many Americans to the \npolls who had not voted recently, and there was a record turnout. In \n2020, turnout broke the record yet again, both for the Republican Party \nand the Democratic Party, and President Biden won that election.\n  In the 2021 election, there were unusually high turnouts for off-year \nelections to the benefit of Republicans and conservatives. You saw \nthat, particularly in the State of Virginia, where the Republican \ncandidates statewide were victorious, and you saw some surprising \nturnouts of opposition to Democrats who were reelected in the State of \nNew Jersey.\n  Democrats accuse Republicans of wanting to keep people from voting. \nWhy would we want to keep people from voting when we have been very \nsuccessful in many large turnout elections very recently?\n  Plus, have you seen the polls today that show dissatisfaction with \nDemocrats--a Republican deficit of five or seven points last year, with \npositive Republican versus Democrat polls this year.\n  So we ought to stop casting doubt about American elections, stop \ncasting aspersions on commonsense election security measures like ID, \nsupported by overwhelming numbers of Americans of all backgrounds. And \nby ``all backgrounds,'' I mean even people whom we classify as \nminorities.\n  Let's work together to boost the confidence of all Americans in our \nelections. Let's start rejecting claims that the only way the other \nparty can win is by rigging elections. Let's retire the short-term \nstrategy of falsely claiming that one of the two parties is a threat to \ndemocracy. That, in and of itself, is a very undemocratic position to \ntake. This kind of rhetoric damages civil society and erodes faith in \nour democracy. For the sake of our country, please stop it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, when Democrats last had the majority and \nproposed blowing up the Senate rules and the historic way that the \nSenate has worked, I gave a series of speeches explaining how the \nfather of the Constitution, James Madison, intended for the Senate to \nbe a deliberative body; in other words, a break on the hot passions \nthat occur in the House of Representatives. I repeated my deeply held \nopposition to gutting the Senate process, even when my party took \ncontrol of all three branches--and it would have been politically \nexpedient in the short term.\n  I don't know how many times President Trump brought up doing away \nwith what we call the filibuster or the 60-vote requirement. It was \neven followed by a lot of our Republican Party grassroots wanting to \novercome Democrats' use of the cloture rule to block the Republican \nagenda during those 4 years. But I spoke out strongly against it.\n  In 2017, over half of the current Democrat Senators signed a letter \ncalling for preservation of the current rules requiring the 60 votes to \nstop debate for considering the legislation, despite the use of the \nnuclear option for nominees.\n  I agree with President Biden's position in 2005. Reflecting on the \nsame understanding that I have of the Constitution and the role of the \nSenate as envisioned by James Madison, then-Senator Biden said this:\n\n       That is the . . . reason . . . we have the . . . rule. So \n     when one party . . . controls all levers of Government, one \n     man or one woman can stand on the floor of the Senate and \n     resist . . . the passions of the moment.\n\n  Even Senator Schumer, the majority leader, said, at that time, \ngutting the cloture rule would be a ``doomsday for democracy''--\ndoomsday for democracy. Now it seems like Senator Schumer invites that \ndoomsday.\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\n  Senator Durbin hit the nail on the head as recently as 2018, saying \nit ``would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and \ncreated going back to our Founding Fathers.'' I agreed then, and I \nagree now.\n  Now the shoe is on the other foot, and Democrats have changed their \nposition, many not for the first time.\n  Senator Durbin has now joined the crusade of his Democratic \npredecessor, Stephen Douglas, of Illinois--famous for debating Abraham \nLincoln on the issues of slavery. But that Douglas from Illinois also \nproposed a Senate rule change allowing a narrow majority to force a \nfinal vote on bills.\n  Hypocrisy is not rare in politics on both sides of the aisle, but the \nfact that Democrats switched principles on such a consequential matter \nwhenever Senate control changes from one party to the other is \nparticularly glaring.\n  The party of Jim Crow, which made liberal use of so-called filibuster \njust over a year ago to block Republicans' agenda, are now saying, \nfalsely, it is a relic of Jim Crow.\n  I do not see how they can look the voters in the eyes with no sign of \nembarrassment. I do not understand why the policemen of our \ngovernmental system--the media--isn't roasting them for this \nhypocritical power grab.\n  I would now like to address a misconception on the cloture motion, \nthe 60-vote requirement. The cloture motion requires 60 votes to bring \nconsideration of legislation to finality. Just because it can be used \nto block legislation, does not mean that the term ``cloture'' always \nequals a filibuster.\n  Cloture cuts off not just debate but the offering of amendments. \nVoting for cloture, also, is saying that the Senate has voted on enough \namendments. Senators who have amendments important to their State that \nthey want to offer should be voting against cloture to preserve their \nright to offer amendments, as their constituents might desire. Debate \nand amendments are the hallmark of this democracy, not an obstacle to \nbe swept aside in pursuit of a short-term partisan agenda.\n  When Democrats last controlled the Senate with 60 votes and \nthereafter, amendment votes became very rare. Even rank-and-file \nDemocrats lost opportunities to represent their States with amendments \nimportant to that State.\n  Let's look at the cloture issue another way. Also, many people \nconfuse debate over filibuster with talking nonstop to delay. That is a \nkind of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' filibuster--the famous movie, \nyou know. This has nothing to do with cloture. People who talk about \nreturning to the so-called talking filibuster are confusing two \ndifferent Senate rules, both called filibuster.\n  Senators have never had to talk until they dropped from exhaustion to \npreserve their right to amend bills. So the talking filibuster rhetoric \nis nonsense. Democrats have convinced themselves or at least their \nactivist base--and done it falsely--that our democracy is in crisis. \nAnd so it is absurd to say only one party, unilateral governance, can \nsave democracy. But once an exception is made--and they are talking \nabout that exception just for this voting rights bill, but once an \nexception is made to the right of all Senators to debate and to amend \nlegislation, there seems to be no going back.\n  Democrats learned that in 2013, when they accomplished the 60-vote \nrequirement on district and circuit court judges, and they lived to \nregret it 4 years later when Republicans did the same thing when we had \na Supreme Court Justice up. It is a slippery slope that you should not \nlet come about.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Would the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very much.\n  First, thank you for coming to the floor to debate such an important \nissue as how to make the Senate work well as a deliberative body and \nhow to make our country work well.\n  I was struck by a couple of things that you mentioned, and that is \nthat you had stood strong fast against striking down the filibuster, \nand you noted how consistent you were. But you also criticized \nDemocrats for changing position.\n  But can you help my memory out on this, because did you not vote to \nstrike down the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So you changed your position, as well you would concede, \nsince previously you had opposed getting rid of the filibuster?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Remember what I said, and I just said this. So you \nobviously heard me. We warned, in 2013, when I think all Republicans \nvoted against reducing the 60-vote threshold for district court and \ncircuit court judges, so you could pack the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, that you would regret that, and you have regretted it because \nRepublicans were saying in 2017: What is good for the goose is good for \nthe gander. And we voted to reduce it then for a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Now, I am sure that, from your point of view, you have a Supreme \nCourt that is not very favorable to what you think a Supreme Court \nought to be doing, with the three people that Trump put on there. So \nthat is where I am coming from.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I do appreciate your response, and it is so rare that we \nactually have any dialogue on the floor of the Senate. It is one of the \nthings we lost.\n  I do recall in that moment that, for over a year, we had working \ngroups trying to resolve the extraordinary level--the new level--of \ncloture motions on President Obama's nominations. It concluded in a \nmeeting in the Old Senate Chamber where the agreement was reached to \nstop doing that. And then, as you point out, Mitch McConnell came to \nthe floor and said: It doesn't matter the quality of the individual who \nis nominated. I will not let any judge be considered for these three \nvacancies.\n  That is a completely unprecedented new element that is brought in to \nbear on that particular conversation. That is just to, kind of, \nilluminate some of the details that were left out.\n  I was struck by another thing you said, which is that the filibuster \nis not a relic of Jim Crow. I was struck about that because from 1891 \nthrough 1965--so we are talking over 80 years--the only thing that was \nblocked in the U.S. Senate by filibuster was civil rights for Black \nAmericans. Given that, wouldn't you say it is fair for us to say that \nthe filibuster in that history was, indeed, a relic of Jim Crow?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Do you know who held the Senate during that period of \ntime on the issue you brought up? It was Democratic Senators from the \nSouth. Remember when the Civil Rights Act, in 1965, was passed, that \nthere was a higher share--a higher percentage--of Republicans than \nDemocrats that voted for it. The one person that made a difference in \ngetting the Civil Rights Act passed was Senator Dirksen, the Republican \nleader.\n  I am going to have to end this discussion with you, but I want to say \none thing. Why would you want to expand this precedent that is set by \nDemocrats into legislation and weaken bipartisanship? That is where you \nhave to leave it. It is a slippery slope. You may intend to do it just \nfor a voting rights act, but it is going to go further.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you for answering and responding to my questions. \nI appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me start by thanking our \ncolleague, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley, for his leadership \nin working to restore the functioning of the Senate and to protect our \ndemocracy. We need both, and we need them now.\n  It was just 12 days ago that we marked the 1-year anniversary of the \nJanuary 6 attack on this Capitol and on our democracy itself. It was a \nviolent attempt to stop Congress from certifying the Presidential \nelection of Joe Biden and to overturn the decision of the American \npeople. It was inspired and instigated by the former President.\n  While that assault did not succeed in stopping us from counting the \nvote that day, the Big Lie did not die. In fact, the Big Lie has \nmetastasized. It has spread, and its poison is seeping across the \ncountry. It is now taking\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nthe form of Republican-controlled State legislatures enacting laws that \nerect new barriers to the ballot box. Let's be clear. They are erecting \nbarriers specifically designed to make it harder for people of color \nand younger voters to cast their ballots.\n  As we saw in a Federal Circuit Court case a number of years ago with \nrespect to North Carolina, the court found that the State legislature \nhad targeted African-American voters with surgical precision.\n  Dr. King observed that voting is ``the foundation stone for political \naction.'' He also observed that when the right to vote is impeded, a \ntragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic tradition are \nbetrayed.\n  What we see happening in State legislatures are not just efforts to \nput up barriers to the ballot box; they are also passing laws to \nauthorize partisan operatives to interfere in the counting of the votes \nand even to overturn the results after the count. So laws to interfere \nwith the casting of the votes and laws to interfere with the counting \nof the votes--that is what is happening right now. Nineteen \nlegislatures around the country have already enacted these kinds of \nlaws.\n  So, yes, our democracy was under attack right here on January 6 of \nlast year, but 1 year later, the evidence is clear: The Big Lie is \nalive, and our democracy is still under attack. It is under attack by \nthose seeking to implement the Big Lie in State legislatures. It is \njust the venue that has changed.\n  When we reconvened here after the attacks of January 6, I said on \nthis floor that what we witnessed is what happens when we don't stand \nup together as Democrats and Republicans to confront the Big Lie.\n  Now, over a year later, we have another chance to stand up together. \nTo meet this moment and to protect our democracy, we need to take \naction here and now. That is what the Freedom to Vote Act does. It \nestablishes minimum standards to ensure equal access to the ballot box \nacross the country. It guards against partisan election meddling. It \nends gerrymandering nationwide, and it ends secret money in elections. \nIt contains the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore \nthe protections guaranteed in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That is \nwhat it does.\n  We are well within our rights as Federal lawmakers to write and pass \nthese bills. The relevant portion of article I, section 4, clause 1 of \nthe Constitution--I have that here--clearly states:\n\n       The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for \n     Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each \n     State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any \n     time by Law make or alter such Regulations.\n\n  The Constitution specifically empowers us to pass these laws to \nprotect voting. So enough of the specious argument I have heard so many \ntimes here on the Senate floor that these bills somehow represent an \nunconstitutional power grab--far from it. The Framers expressly \nempowered the Congress to protect Federal elections.\n  Now, all 50 Members of the Democratic majority, the Democratic \ncaucus, support these bills to protect our democracy. I am disappointed \nthat, as of this moment, not one Member of the Senate Republican caucus \nplans to join us. In fact, we know that there are 16 Republican \nSenators here today who voted in 2006 to reauthorize the Voting Rights \nAct. Today, not a single Republican Senator will stand up and support \nthese bills. That is a very sad and bad sign of this moment in our \nhistory.\n  I accept that each and every Senator has the right to cast their vote \non bills however they choose. That is the way democracy works. But what \nis happening now is very different. Republican Senators are using the \ncurrent version of the Senate rules to block a vote on these vital \nmeasures to protect our democracy; to prevent this body from having a \nfinal vote on the Freedom to Vote legislation and the John R. Lewis \nVoting Rights Advancement Act.\n  So let's step back and look at how the current version of the Senate \nrules operates in practice, and I say ``current rules'' because the \nSenate rules have evolved over time, as our colleague from Oregon has \nmentioned. They have taken many twists and turns over the years. In \ntheir current form and practice, they have departed radically from \ntheir original purpose and design.\n  Today, with some exceptions, 41 out of 100 Senators can block the \nother 59 from voting on legislation that is important to the American \npeople. Over the last year, this Senate rule has been used to block \nbills that enact commonsense gun safety provisions and provide for \nequal pay for equal work. Many other bills have been blocked from even \ngetting a vote under the current Senate rules.\n  So let's unpack this. Let's understand what this means.\n  Right now, under our rules, it is possible for 41 Senators \nrepresenting 21 States and 11 percent of the U.S. population to block \nthe will of 50 Senators representing 84 percent of the U.S. population. \nThink about that. Under our current rules, Senators representing a \nsmall percentage of the population--11 percent--can block the will of \nthe majority.\n  How did this happen? Well, it happened because over time--not at the \nbeginning but over time--Senators decided to empower themselves at the \nexpense of the American people. It wasn't always this way. As I said, \nin its earliest days, the Senate was founded on two principles. The \nfirst was that Senators would have ample opportunity to make their case \nto their fellow Senators and to the country. If they had the minority \nposition on a particular issue, they had a chance to come here to the \nfloor of the Senate to persuade their colleagues of the merits of their \nposition and maybe in the process have the whole country turn to their \nside of the debate and influence the ultimate result.\n\n  So the Senators were given the opportunity for a prolonged debate to \nensure that all opinions were heard and considered before the final \nvote. In fact, as my colleague from Oregon mentioned, each Senator was \nable to deliver two speeches on a particular question on a single \nlegislative day. But after all the views were heard, after prolonged \ndebate was ended, the Senate would move to a majority vote. That is how \nthe Senate earned its representation as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  Nothing could be further from that truth today. We have very little \ndebate on the Senate floor today--real debate, where Senators engage on \nthe big questions of the day. In fact, the minority of Senators who \noppose legislation pending before the Senate can block it without even \ncoming to the Senate floor to debate. They don't even have to come here \nto make their case to their fellow Senators and the American people, \ndon't even have to show up to debate. We are talking about a Senate \nrule that was designed to encourage debate. Yet we have it operating \ntoday where nobody has to even show up on this floor to make their \nposition known.\n  It is not that Senators don't even have to show up to debate; they \ndon't even have to show up for the vote to cut off debate. Under our \ncurrent rules, we could have a vote right here in the Senate of 59 to \nnothing in favor of moving forward on legislation, and the 41 Senators \nwho didn't even show up would carry the day. They would block the 59 \nfrom expressing the will of the American people. How crazy is that? \nThat is what the current Senate rules provide.\n  That is not what the Founders of our Republic envisioned. In fact, \nthe current version and application of the Senate's rules amount to a \ntotal perversion of the constitutional framework. These rules pervert \nthe intent of our Framers, and they undermine the democratic \narchitecture of our Republic.\n  Our Founders never--never--intended for a minority of Senators--for \n41 Senators--to be able to thwart the will of the majority and of the \npeople.\n  In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton asserted that the fundamental \nmaxim of republican government was ``the sense of the majority should \nprevail.''\n  Even more clearly right on point was James Madison in Federalist 58, \nwhere he directly warned against requiring more than a majority for a \ndecision in the legislature, saying that ``the fundamental principle of \nfree government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority \nthat would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.'' This \nis James Madison, a key architect of our Constitution and the framework \nof this Republic.\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\n  Now, we know it is true that the Framers of our Constitution knew the \ndangers of overly powerful majorities, and they wanted to and did guard \nagainst that risk in the Constitution itself. That is why the Framers \ndiffused power among the people, among the States, and within the \nFederal Government--to protect minority viewpoints in the country.\n  In the Bill of Rights, our Founders clearly said that each American \nhas certain unalienable rights that no government action can take \naway--not by a vote of this Congress, not by an order of the President, \nnot by anybody in the executive branch. That is the Bill of Rights. Our \nFounders also created three coequal branches of government constrained \nby a system of checks and balances. It is all right here in the \nConstitution. Within the legislative branch, they didn't create one \nunitary body, like most Parliaments today; they created two separate \nbodies--the Senate and the House of Representatives--and a totally \nindependent executive branch, with the President directly elected by \nthe people through the electoral college.\n  Now, I think it is worth pointing out that the Senate contains built-\nin protections for the minority by its very structure. The 2 Senators \nfrom Wyoming represent 578,000 of our fellow Americans, and the 2 \nSenators from California represent 39 million of our fellow Americans. \nTwo Senators from Wyoming represent 578,000 people, and 2 Senators from \nCalifornia represent 39 million Americans, but here in the Senate, each \nof those Senators, whether from Wyoming or California, has votes of \nequal weight. We can do the math, the political math.\n  People of Wyoming are already exerting influence here in the Senate \nway out of proportion to their share of the American population. That \nis in the structure. But if you layer the current version of the Senate \nfilibuster rule on top of the Senate structure and on top of other \nprotections for minority rights enshrined in our Constitution, you \nfurther nullify the will of the American people. You nullify the will \nof the majority of our fellow citizens.\n  That is why the anti--majoritarian, anti-democratic--small ``d''--\nSenate rule is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. You can search \nhigh and low; it is nowhere to be found here. In fact, as I said, our \nFounders were very clear about allowing the majority sentiment vote to \nprevail in the end. And they were very clear in this document, the \nConstitution, exactly when to require a supermajority vote. It is right \nhere: Two-thirds vote of all Members is required to convict and remove \na President; two-thirds vote is needed to expel a Senator; two-thirds \nneeded to override a Presidential veto; two-thirds vote to concur on \ntreaties; two-thirds to amend the Constitution. That is it. That is \nwhat is in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Our Founders did not envision a Senate where the normal course of \nlegislative process and business could be permanently blocked by a \nminority of Senators. There is nothing in here about needing 60 out of \n100 votes to pass legislation like the Freedom to Vote Act. There is \nnothing in our Constitution about a Senate where 41 out of 100 Senators \ncan routinely block the will of the majority and subvert the will of \nthe American people.\n  James Madison expressly warned against requiring supermajorities for \nlegislation--yes for treaties, yes for removal of a President, not for \nthe normal course of legislation.\n  So where did the current Senate rule come from? It is a total \ninvention of Senators that empowers individual Senators by \ndisempowering the overwhelming majority of the American people. That is \nwhat it is.\n  Think about this in the context of the Freedom to Vote Act. The duly \nelected President of the United States, who won over 80 million votes \nand in the electoral college, is in favor of it. A majority of the \nHouse of Representatives representing the majority of the American \npeople is in favor of it. And 50 U.S. Senators representing 62 percent \nof the American people are in favor of it. But the bill is being \nblocked by a minority of Senators representing a minority of the \nAmerican people.\n  And think about this. State legislatures around the country, as we \ngather here, are passing laws to erect barriers to voting by a majority \nvote. The laws they are passing impact every citizen in this country \nbecause they impact the outcome of Federal elections. When State \nlegislatures in Georgia pass laws to disenfranchise voters in Federal \nelections, they are disenfranchising voters in all of the other 49 \nStates who have a stake in the outcome of Federal elections.\n  But the current version of the Senate rules prevents the U.S. Senate \nfrom casting a majority vote to protect voting for every American, even \nthough the Constitution expressly empowers us to do that--to regulate \nFederal elections.\n  So, Mr. President, what arguments do proponents of the current \nfilibuster rule present to justify this self-anointed power to thwart \nthe majority will of the American people?\n  One claim is that it promotes bipartisanship. Look, I know the \nPresiding Officer. I know the Senator from Virginia who has joined us. \nI know the Senator from Oregon. All of us prefer to find common ground \nto meet the challenges of the day when we can. I am proud to be the \nauthor of many bipartisan measures and to sponsor many others, and to \nvote for many of those measures. But let's not kid ourselves here in \nthe U.S. Senate about the ability of the 60-vote requirement to promote \nbipartisanship. The Senate we are living in today is the most polarized \never. The claim that this rule promotes bipartisanship flies in the \nface of the reality we witness every day.\n  In fact, the filibuster in its current form has become a partisan \npolitical weapon. Tim Lau of the Brennan Center notes that, while there \nhave been more than 2,000 filibusters since 1917, about half of them \nhave been in just the past 12 years. Think about that. There were more \nfilibusters in President Obama's second term than in all the years \nbetween World War I and the end of the Reagan administration combined. \nThis abuse has led to partisan gridlock, not bipartisan cooperation.\n  But let's talk about bipartisanship. I had hoped--we had hoped--that \naction to preserve our democracy would be a bipartisan endeavor. But \nthat isn't where we are today, and that is not new. The battle to \nprotect constitutional rights has been waged along party lines in the \npast. The Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to former \nslaves and guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed by \nRepublicans in Congress with almost no bipartisan support. We salute \nthem for that action. The 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote \nto all citizens of the United States, and it was passed by one party \nand one party alone. Those actions were taken by the old Republican \nParty that used to be the party of Lincoln. Should we have sacrificed \nthose critical amendments at the altar of bipartisanship? Should we \nhave said to them: Don't pass them because no Democrats at that time \nsupported them? Of course not.\n  We all strive for bipartisanship, but that goal should not stand in \nthe way of legislative action, especially on issues central to \nprotecting our democracy.\n\n  Another argument often made, including by many of our Democratic \ncolleagues, in favor of keeping the current version of the Senate rules \nand the supermajority requirement, highlights the risk of giving up the \n``protection'' of the filibuster on issues that Democrats hold dear and \nwhere Republicans hold a different position.\n  If we eliminate the 60-vote threshold to pass policies that \nRepublicans don't like, won't Republicans be able to use a majority \nvote to pass policies that Democrats don't like?\n  That is true. That is the nature of democracy. That is what elections \nare for--every 2 years for Members of the House, every 6 years for the \nSenate, and every 4 years for the President. If the American people \ndon't like a law that we have passed, they get to go to the ballot box \nto render a decision. That is the ultimate accountability in the \nsystem, and we should not be erecting artificial rules to protect \nourselves from the majority views of the American people.\n  In fact, it is simply arrogant--arrogant--to invent a rule that \nblocks the will of the American people. It is simply arrogant to say \nthat we Senators, not we the people, are the guardians of our \ndemocracy, and we are going to come up with this rule that is not in \nthe Constitution to do that. That is what our current Senate rules do.\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\n  Now, there is one major exception to the 60-vote rule to end a \nfilibuster on legislation. It is called the reconciliation process. I \nbelieve that this major exception exposes the absurdity of the current \nSenate rule itself. Most folks watching this debate may be justifiably \nconfused. They are watching the Senate and they are saying: It was \nabout a year ago that the Senate passed the American Rescue Plan with a \nmajority vote. It was a vote of 50 to 49. It was a major piece of \nlegislation responding to the pandemic emergency. Not a single \nRepublican Senator voted for it, but it passed. During the Trump \nadministration, Senate Republicans passed a major tax giveaway to the \nrich by a vote of 51 to 48. Not a single Democrat voted for it.\n  Those laws contained major policy changes, but they could not be \nblocked by a vote of a minority of 41 Senators. Why is that? It is \nbecause in 1974, the Senate carved out a major exception to the \nsupermajority filibuster rule for legislation connected to the annual \nbudget process. That carve-out--that procedure--allowed for the passage \nof the Trump tax law, for the American Rescue Plan, and earlier for the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  So, colleagues, here we are maintaining this carve-out to the \nfilibuster rule that allows Donald Trump and Senate Republicans to pass \nbig tax cuts by a majority party-line vote. You can't block it with a \nvote of 41. It allows us to pass important things like the American \nRescue Plan, using the same procedure.\n  But our rules don't allow us to pass rules to protect our democracy. \nThat is absurd. Anyone paying close attention to the rules would see \nhow absurd that is in a great democracy, and it needs to change and it \nneeds to change now.\n  Each day that we maintain the current undemocratic Senate rules that \nallow 41 Senators to block the will of the majority, we allow State \nlegislatures to continue their assault on democracy and we prevent our \nown democracy from working the way it was intended.\n  The American people sent us here to get things done, to move the \ncountry forward, and the overwhelming majority are crying out for us to \nprotect the future of our democracy. That is why we must amend the \nundemocratic rule that empowers 41 of 100 Senators to disempower the \nmajority of the people of our country.\n  And I support the proposal put forward by our colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Merkley, that takes us back to the original design and intent \nof the first Senate and the Framers--debate. Everyone gets a chance to \nmake their point. Convince your colleagues and convince the American \npeople. But as James Madison said, at the end of the day, a great \ndemocracy must have a majority rule subject to the conditions already \napplied and set out in our Constitution.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join us in restoring the Senate to its \noriginal purpose and then to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, including \nthe John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect our \ndemocracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, last week, I gave a long, detailed \nspeech on the topic that was at hand last week and is the topic, right \nnow, that we are focusing on here in the U.S. Senate: voting rights and \nthe majority leader's goal this week, as it was last week, to blow up \nthe legislative filibuster.\n  I believe it would be the first time in U.S. history that a majority \nleader would actually seek to do this--to blow up the legislative \nfilibuster--which, in and of itself, says a lot. This would, of course, \nchange the Senate and change the country forever. There will be a lot \nof speeches on that. There will be many more speeches today, tomorrow, \nand Thursday on these important topics.\n  Now, the President of the United States weighed in on these two \ntopics--the filibuster and voting rights--in Georgia, in a speech last \nweek that is already going down as an infamous speech by a President of \nthe United States. Let's just say it really didn't go very well, the \nPresident's speech.\n  I ask all Americans to take a look at it. It is quite disturbing for \na whole host of reasons. The President's speech was almost universally \npanned, on the left even, on the right, and in the center. I have not \nseen one U.S. Senator come down on the floor, this week, to defend it. \nIt will be interesting, as we debate these issues, if anyone does, but \nI doubt there will be, and there are many reasons for this.\n  As a speech by a President, it was remarkably divisive--in essence, \ncalling every Senator, Democrat or Republican, who doesn't agree with \nhim a racist and a traitor. Read the speech. It was historically \nabsurd--invoking the sacrifices of the Civil War and heroes like \nAbraham Lincoln and villains like Jefferson Davis to present-day \ncircumstances. It was profoundly un-Presidential, as Senator McConnell \nstated, rhetoric, completely unbecoming of a President of the United \nStates, and in an attempt to get Senators, especially Democrat \nSenators, to vote the way in which President Biden wants them to vote, \nit appears to have been a monumental failure. Now, I wonder why. Well, \nof course, here is why.\n  Calling someone a racist and a traitor is not the normal, logical \nroute to try to persuade one to come over to your side--neither is \nclaiming that Republican Senators, Republican legislators, States, and \nRepublican State voting laws are so-called Jim Crow 2.0, when your very \nown State's laws, in terms of voting, are some of the most restrictive \nin the country. This is a narrative, I hope, our friends in the media \nwill keep an eye on during the debates this week.\n  What am I talking about?\n  Well, first and foremost, I am talking about Majority Leader Schumer \nand Joe Biden and their States, New York and Delaware, which have some \nof the most restrictive voting laws in America. Let me repeat that. \nSome of the most restrictive voting laws in America come from the \nmajority leader's State and the President of the United States' State. \nYet listen to their rhetoric. Listen to their rhetoric: Republicans and \nRepublican States are ``Jim Crow 2.0.''\n  I was on the floor last week, talking in particular detail about my \nState's laws. We are all different States here, but I know my State's \nlaws. I know them well as they relate to voting rights. Here is one \nthing I said last week: On some of the most critical issues, in terms \nof voting rights legislation--early in-person voting, automatic voter \nregistration, and this chart here of no-excuse absentee voting--the \nRepublican State of Alaska, the great State of Alaska, has voting laws \nthat are significantly more expansive than the laws of New York, than \nthe laws of Delaware, than the laws of Connecticut, than the laws of \nMassachusetts, than the laws of New Hampshire. It is a long list, a \nlong list. You can see why Senators like me--my constituents, in \nparticular--find it more than just a little bit annoying when you have \nthese smug arguments of Republican States being Jim Crow 2.0.\n\n  Let me give you another particular one as it relates to New York, the \nmajority leader's home State.\n  My State has no-excuse absentee voting. We have had that for many, \nmany years--many years. Now, the State of New York just had a statewide \nreferendum to have same-day voter registration and no-excuse absentee \nvoting to meet the high standards that we have in Alaska. The people of \nNew York recently rejected that. I don't know why. I am not from New \nYork. I am sure they had what they thought were good reasons to do \nthat, but if the majority leader keeps coming down and calling the \nRepublican States that restrict voting Jim Crow 2.0, is he going to go \nto Times Square and call his own constituents Jim Crow 2.0, relative to \nmy great State--because they just rejected doing this, restricting \nvoting rights--according to the logic of the majority leader and the \nPresident of the United States?\n  There is something really wrong here on these arguments and it is not \njust New York and it is not just my making these arguments about where \nother States are. Again, my argument here is\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nnot to say: Well, everybody should be like Alaska. In the Constitution, \nthe Founders gave the States the fundamental right and obligation and \nresponsibility to design their States' laws in terms of voting. What is \nreally difficult to swallow is that so many of the arguments we are \ngoing to hear this week and that we heard last week and that we heard \nfrom the President of the United States come from elected officials--\nU.S. Senators and the President, who is a former Senator--who come from \nStates that have some of the most least restrictive voting laws in the \ncountry.\n  Again, it is not just me making this argument. This is an article I \nsubmitted for the Record, last week, from The Atlantic magazine--not a \nRepublican mouthpiece by any measure. I am going to read extensively \nfrom this article, which came out last year, because it really makes \nthe point I am trying to make.\n\n       Biden has assailed Georgia's new voting law as an atrocity \n     akin to ``Jim Crow in the 21st century'' for the impact it \n     could have on Black citizens. But even once the GOP-passed \n     measure takes effect, Georgia citizens will have far more \n     opportunities to vote before Election Day than their \n     counterparts in the president's home state, where one in \n     three residents is Black or Latino. To Republicans, Biden's \n     criticism of the Georgia law smacks of hypocrisy. ``They have \n     a point,'' says Dwayne Bensing, a voting-rights advocate with \n     Delaware's ACLU affiliate. ``The state is playing catch-up--\n\n  The State of Delaware--\n\n     in a lot of ways.''\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Delaware isn't an anomaly among Democratic strongholds, and \n     its example presents the president's party with an \n     uncomfortable reminder: Although Democrats like to call out \n     Republicans for trying to suppress voting, the states they \n     control in the Northeast make casting a ballot more difficult \n     than anywhere else.\n\n  I am going to read that again. I am going to read that again because \nit is an issue that no one is talking about, and it really smacks of \nhypocrisy when I see some of my colleagues down here making these great \narguments about Jim Crow 2.0 in Republican States.\n  Here it is again, from The Atlantic:\n\n       Delaware isn't an anomaly among Democrat strongholds--\n\n  Democratic State strongholds--\n\n     and its example presents the president's party with an \n     uncomfortable reminder. Although Democrats like to call out \n     Republicans for trying to suppress voting, the states they \n     control in the Northeast make casting a ballot more difficult \n     than anywhere else.\n\n  Then the article goes on to say:\n\n       Connecticut has no early voting at all--\n\n  Holy cow, my State has early voting. We have had it for years--\n\n     and New York's onerous rules force voters to change their \n     registration months in advance if they want to participate in \n     a party primary.\n\n  And, by the way, New York just rejected what Alaska has. Jim Crow 2.0 \nin New York? Who knows? Maybe, according to the President's logic.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       In Rhode Island, Democrats enacted a decade ago the kind of \n     photo-ID law that the [Democratic] party has labeled \n     ``racist'' when drafted by Republicans.\n\n  Hmm, a little bit of hypocrisy there.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       [T]he State [Rhode Island] also requires voters to get the \n     signatures of not one but two witnesses when casting an \n     absentee ballot (only Alabama and North Carolina are \n     similarly strict).\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       According to a new analysis released this week by the \n     nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, \n     Delaware, Connecticut, and New York rank in the bottom third \n     of states in their access to early and mail-in balloting.\n\n  And, as I just said, New York just rejected it again. I really wonder \nif the majority leader is going to come down and call his citizens Jim \nCrow 2.0.\n  This is a very important issue, and here is the bottom line: Before \nany of my Democratic colleagues come to the floor this week with their \ninsults, with their smug, offensive, inaccurate arguments about Jim \nCrow 2.0 racist traders, mimicking the President of the United States \nlast week in Georgia, I want my colleagues to come and answer this \nsimple question--a very simple question: Why should we listen to you? \nWhy should any American take you seriously, when so many of you come \nfrom States with the most restrictive voting laws in America?\n  I wonder if any of my colleagues are going to come down to the floor, \nparticularly those like the majority leader, who love to rant about Jim \nCrow 2.0 when their States are leading the charge in America on \nrestrictive voting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, this past weekend--and yesterday, in \nparticular--we celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is likely, if \nyou attended any event in that celebration, that you heard at least \npart of his ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Many of us in the Chamber \nhappily quoted it because of our respect for him and the eloquence of \nhis language in that moment.\n  We like to remember the hopeful second half of that speech, as well, \nbecause Dr. King imagined a future in which Black children and White \nchildren play together, and all people are judged, as he so famously \nsaid, ``not by the color of our skin but by the content of our \ncharacter.''\n  However, many of us forget--or worse, ignore--the first half of that \nspeech, in which Dr. King noted the painful irony that 100 years after \nthe Emancipation Proclamation--the ``promissory note'' of our \nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence was for most Black \nAmericans simply ``a bad check which has come back marked `insufficient \nfunds.' ''\n  Many Democratic Senators and Republican Senators helped to change \nthat shameful fact. It was here on the floor of this Chamber, in 1965, \nthat the U.S. Senate voted 77 to 19 to pass the Voting Rights Act, \noutlawing State practices that denied millions of Americans, \nparticularly Black Americans, the right to vote. It is worth noting \nthat it was a strong bipartisan vote and that, percentagewise, a \ngreater percentage of the Republican Caucus voted in support of it, \ncompared to Democrats. The White Democrats from the South were \nnotorious at that time for opposing it and opposing the civil rights \nmovement.\n  Well, over the next nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act was \nreauthorized five times, and that bipartisanship continued during the \nentire period. Each new version of the Voting Rights Act renewed the \npromise and the protections of that law, and each reauthorization was \nsigned into law by a Republican President.\n  Sadly, in more recent years, things have changed in an awful way. We \nhave witnessed a sustained effort to chip away the protections \nguaranteed to every American under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, and a trip to St. Louis was a big \ndeal. I can remember my mother, who was an immigrant to this country, \nhad only an eighth grade education, though she had self-taught herself \ninto a much higher level of learning, but I can remember my mother \nalways pointing out the St. Louis courthouse to me. If you are familiar \nwith the terrain, the arch wasn't there when I was growing up. But \nwhere that arch is today, just behind it, is this famous St. Louis \ncourthouse. We would be driving over the Eads Bridge, and she would say \nto me: Now, do you see that St. Louis courthouse up there? That big \nwhite building, do you see it? And do you see all those steps that you \ncan see from here?\n  Yes.\n  They used to sell slaves on those steps.\n  I found it incredible that my mom would say that. She was not a \nhistorian or, as I had mentioned, formally educated, but she knew that, \nand she knew that was the significance of that building. It was also \nthe courthouse where the Dred Scott decision was argued.\n  I say that because the Dred Scott decision, that infamous decision \nhanded down in 1857, may have been the tipping point when it came to \nour Civil War. A decision by that court, now viewed as nothing short of \noutrageous, basically ruled that enslaved people, regardless of where \nthey lived in the United States, could never be treated as American \ncitizens and had no right to sue in the Federal courts of America.\n  Despite State decisions to have free States and enslaved States, \ndespite the Missouri Compromise, the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott \ndecision basically came down clearly on the side of\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nenslavement and said, for example, that the Missouri court doctrine of \n``once free, always free'' did not help Harriet and Dred Scott, who \nlived in free States part of their lives.\n  That decision by the Supreme Court was a seminal decision in the \nhistory of our country. It is often noted the role that it played and \nthe events that transpired afterward.\n  I think of that decision when I think of what has happened in recent \nyears in the Supreme Court. Nine years ago, in 2013, the Supreme Court \nissued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder. That Supreme Court \ndecision essentially nullified a key provision of the Voting Rights \nAct: section 5. Prior to the Court's ruling in Shelby County, section 5 \nrequired localities disenfranchising people based on race through poll \ntaxes or literacy tests to seek Federal approval to any changes in \ntheir voting rules. That requirement is known as preclearance, and it \ncould have--I believe it would have--prevented many of the restrictive \nvoting laws in Georgia and Texas.\n\n  The Supreme Court weakened another key section of the Voting Rights \nAct with its decision in Brnovich v. DNC. With these distorted \nrulings--distorted rulings--in fact, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan \nwrote, ``In the last decade, this Court has treated no statute worse \nthan the Voting Rights Act of 1965.''\n  The Presiding Officer knows what has happened across the United \nStates in 19 different States. I think, because of decisions like \nShelby and Brnovich, these States have been emboldened. They don't \nbelieve that they are going to be held accountable for decisions they \nare making that restrict the right to vote the way they would have been \nbefore those decisions. And those who come to the defense of those \nStates and their practices come to the floor of the Senate and, \npredictably, argue States' rights, States' rights.\n  I heard over the weekend on some of the talk shows--I don't know if \nthere is a copy of it here. Oh, there is. I was hoping there would be a \ncopy of the Constitution in this desk, and there is. But article I, \nsection 4 of our Constitution is explicit, for those who question \nwhether or not it is the exclusive province of the States to establish \nstandards for elections. I am going to read it.\n\n       Section 4. ``The Times, Places and Manner of holding \n     Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be \n     prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the \n     Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such \n     Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.''\n\n  Of course, then the amendments following the Civil War--during and \nfollowing the Civil War--went even further in terms of voting and the \nissue of race.\n  It is very clear to me--and you only have to read those simple words, \nstraightforward and direct in the Constitution, to realize that \nestablishing standards for elections is not exclusively within the \nprovince of the State. In fact, just the opposite is true. When it \ncomes to Federal elections for Representatives and Senators, authority \nis given to us--to us--this Senate and the House of Representatives. \nAnd, of course, through the signature of the President, the law is \ncreated that can establish standards and regulations.\n  Yet Members on the other side, Members on the side of President \nLincoln's political party, the Republican Party, now come to us at this \nmoment in history and argue nullification and States' rights. What a \ncruel twist of fate that Mr. Lincoln's party, which took such pride in \nthe progress that was made after the deadly Civil War in establishing \ncivil rights, is now defending the activities of 19 different States \nthat restrict voting rights.\n  Today, our democracy needs the Voting Rights Act of 1965 restored to \nits full power and potential. In the past year alone, Republican \nlegislatures in nearly 20 States have enacted laws making it harder for \nAmericans to vote. In total, more than 440 bills with voting \nrestrictions have been introduced in 49 States, and more are on the way \nas the 2022 State legislative sessions get underway. These efforts \nrepresent the most coordinated assault on voting rights since the \nVoting Rights Act was first passed under President Lyndon Johnson.\n  The most troubling of these bills, the ones that I just find \nincredible, grant partisan actors the power to potentially meddle and \ninterfere in election administration. Now, where could they possibly \nhave come up with that idea; that if you lose an election, you would \ncontact the election authorities and ask them to change the results for \nyour favor? Where could they have come up with that idea or notion, \nthat outrageous idea? Perhaps in the recording that we have of the \nconversation between Georgia election officials and President Donald \nTrump after he lost the election in 2020. That is exactly what he set \nout to do. And now, they are setting up a scenario for that same \nstrategy and tactic to be followed in other States if you are \ndisappointed with the outcome of an election.\n  Arkansas and Kansas have already passed laws that--according to \nexperts from the States United Democracy Center, Protect Democracy, and \nLaw Forward--could be used to shift the power to influence election \noutcomes to partisan political actors. In those States, they have \nincreased the possibility that the voters won't have the last word.\n  And legislatures in other States have introduced troubling bills with \nsimilar implications. For instance, in the State of Arizona, State \nlegislators introduced three separate bills that, according to the \nBrennan Center for Justice, ``would have directly empowered partisan \nofficials to reject or overturn election results.'' It is an incredible \noutcome.\n  More traditional attacks on the right to vote include efforts in \nMichigan, for example, where a group of Republican lawmakers are \nattempting to bypass the State's Governor as well as the State's voters \nto enact a measure restricting voting rights. And, of course, in Texas, \nthe State enacted a bill known as S.B. 1, which the Brennan Center \ncalled ``one of the harshest restrictive voting bills in the country.'' \nOne of the most troubling provisions of the law will make it harder for \nvoters living with disabilities to receive the accommodations and \nassistance they need to exercise their right to vote.\n  The Members of this Senate have a constitutional obligation to \nrespond to these State voting laws, and that means ensuring that the \nconstitutional right to vote is protected by Federal law and fully \nenforceable. It also means establishing nationwide standards that \nensure every eligible voter can participate in our democracy. These \nremedies and protections must be available in every State, red and \nblue, from New York to Arizona.\n  Allow me to make one other point, Mr. President. I have heard my \nRepublican colleagues make the argument: Well, take a look at the \nStates across the blue belt of America, States like Delaware and New \nYork; they don't go as far as the law that is being suggested by you \nDemocrats--for example, same-day registration, for those who want to \nshow up and establish their voter registration on the day of the \nelection. This bill is going to require it. The State of New York \ndoesn't have it. The State of Delaware doesn't have it.\n  Well, my message to them is: Good. Let them get it. It is a good, \npositive way to expand the opportunity to vote. Many States have done \nit for years without problems. Those who are lagging, whether they are \nred or blue, should come into the 21st century. It should be our \nmission--our singular mission, before anything else--to make sure that \nevery eligible American has the right to vote; that we eliminate the \nburdens and obstacles, the tricks and traps that have been set up in \nall these States that make it so difficult. And we ought to be \nsingularly embarrassed as a nation as we look at the film and all the \nvideos and all the programs on election day that show African Americans \nstanding in line, hour after weary hour, to exercise the right to vote \nwhile many White voters just scoot through in other localities in the \nsame States. There is something fundamentally wrong here, and it is not \njust an accident.\n\n  Last year, I joined with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to \nintroduce the updated John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This \nlegislation would restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \none of the most important pieces of legislation in American history. \nAnd truthfully, this should, once again, be a bipartisan, unifying \nendeavor.\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\n  It hasn't been that long ago that Republicans and Democrats stood \ntogether and agreed that this was the right thing to do--to make sure \nthat there was no discrimination against American voters. The last time \nwe did this was 16 years ago, in 2006, and on a nearly unanimous basis.\n  One of the Republicans who voted in support of it was the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, now the Republican leader, who said at that \ntime, when he voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in \n2006, ``[T]his is a piece of legislation which has worked.''\n  Well, let's make sure it can keep working. I hope my colleagues will \ncome together, in a bipartisan fashion, and join us in supporting the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act as well as the Freedom to Vote \nAct. Join us in defending American democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I was out here a little while ago \ntalking about why it is so important for us to move forward and vote on \nthe John Lewis Voting Rights Act and to uphold the voting rights of \nAmerican citizens, something I feel very strongly about.\n  I have had the good fortune to be in the U.S. Senate since the year \n2000 and I got here--I should say the election was in 2000; I took the \noath of office in 2001. I got here in an election that was decided by \n2,229 votes. It took 3 weeks to decide the election. It took recounts. \nIt took verification by counties--and, yes, the vote-by-mail system \nwhich was pretty much the majority of votes at that point in time. Not \neverybody voted that way, but a big portion of votes at that time was a \nsystem that was starting to flourish in our State.\n  And when I think about the year 2000 and the close election, I give \nthanks to my predecessor Slade Gordon for, even though it was a close \nelection, not contesting the election. If people remember, that was the \nsame year that there was such a close election that people considered \nwhat was the outcome in Florida. And yet Al Gore conceded the election \nto George Bush.\n  My point is that where have we gotten to today? Because all of those \npeople, George Bush, Al Gore, me, Slade Gordon, even though we had \nclose elections, we had confidence in the outcome of the election, and \nwe moved forward.\n  We moved forward so much in fact that when our country was attacked \njust a few months later, we all pulled together to work together to \nbuild a more secure nation. We didn't sit around and say--Slade Gordon \ndidn't sit around and say, ``I lost by 2,229 votes.'' Al Gore didn't \nsit around and say he lost Florida by so many votes and the votes \nweren't counted.\n  No, we moved our country forward, and here in the U.S. Senate, we \neven discussed voting rights, and we discussed our Federal role, and we \ndiscussed what reforms we wanted to have in the system to build more \nconfidence in our electoral system. We didn't disintegrate into voter \nsuppression activities. I can't say that there wasn't some.\n  I now call it nostalgia. There were some who said, ``Oh, yeah, vote-\nby-mail. Maybe we shouldn't have it.'' I remember one of our colleagues \nhere on the Senate floor, he was saying, ``I so much like to go into \nthe polling place. It is my patriotic duty. I like to sign my name. I \nlike to get on with it. I don't want to get rid of that and I don't \nlike vote-by-mail.''\n  Well, myself and Senator Wyden, Senator Murray, and others \nsuccessfully defended vote-by-mail. And we can see today where it has \nnow been more embraced in the United States of America and more than \nthe nostalgia that my friend had.\n  Trust me, I could say a lot of nostalgia about going into a voting \nplace and voting. My childhood was spent getting the vote out because \nthat is what you did in my family. You spent the day getting the vote \nout; you helped. I remember 1 year, I said to my father, ``I'd miss too \nmuch school, and I didn't want to miss anymore school, and I had to go \nto school on election day.'' He told me there was no greater education \nthan getting the vote out and that I was going to be doing that. So I \ncan be nostalgic, too.\n  But right now, I am proud of the 84 percent turnout in the State of \nWashington in a Presidential election year, thanks to vote-by-mail. And \nI am proud that vote-by-mail, I think, is the antidote to the \naccusations that people have about a voting system that they think can \nbe attacked by a foreign government or undermined in an electronic \nvoting system. The fact that when you vote-by-mail, you sign your name, \nboth on the registration form, sign your name on the mail-in ballot, \nrip off a tab, basically mail in that ballot, and you have proof that \nyou voted. And your signature is the verification. I am going to talk \nabout that in a minute.\n  Your signature is the verification that that system works. So, yes, I \nam not very happy that we are here because a lot of the tactics that we \nare hearing about around the United States of America is about limiting \nvote-by-mail. It is about trying to stop it or slow it down or raise \naccusations about how it doesn't work.\n  And part of the initial establishment of preclearance in the United \nStates in the 1965 Voting Rights Act was about the great disparity that \nexisted in the United States between States, that some States had very \ndifferent turnouts than other States in a Presidential election, maybe \n20 percent or 30 percent different. And so people were starting to say, \n``How are you affecting us if some States aren't really empowering \ntheir citizens to vote, and the consequences is suppressing voter \nactivity?''\n  I definitely believe in the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. I \ndefinitely believe that, starting in 1965, we had disparity in States \nand the way they voted, and we did something about it. And we did \nsomething about it because people were being discriminated against, and \nthat was the premise of the law, stop the discrimination.\n  Stop the discriminatory tactics that States were using to \ndiscriminate against people so that their votes couldn't be cast. And \nnow, we have updated that law many times over the last several decades \nin a bipartisan fashion, most of the time signed into law by Republican \nPresidents. So I don't get the stumbling block here. I don't get the \nstumbling block why people won't come to the table and help us write \nthe next version of the 1965 Civil Rights Act that is just called the \n2022 Civil Rights Act. I don't get it. I don't get why people aren't \ncoming to the table to do that. But I know this, that one of the big \nlies out there, and the Republicans--I see my colleague was here from \nAlaska, and I do feel a great affinity.\n  People may not understand the relationship between the State of \nAlaska and the State of Washington, but it is a very true affinity. We \ncome from the same part of the world. Our economies are integrated. We \nhave many people who live in both places. We share commonality of \nculture, of our environment. And my colleague from Alaska was here \ntalking about their vote-by-mail system.\n  And so the fact that people are telling lies and trying to suppress \nthe vote by suppressing vote-by-mail or calling it fraudulent is very \nfrustrating. It is very frustrating, and it is one of the reasons we \nshould come together in a bipartisan way and support vote-by-mail. We \nshould be empowering people, and particularly in a pandemic, to cast a \nvote so that we know their voting is counted, so that we can have \nconfidence we had an election and people spoke.\n  Here, we have Newt Gingrich who said numerous times now, ``The \nbiggest way to expand voter fraud is to expand vote-by-mail.'' Now, he \nsaid that on FOX News. It has been quoted in the paper--not once, he \nsaid it several times--or maybe they keep reading the same clip over \nand over again.\n  Then his next line, which I didn't put on a chart, is, ``And the \nDemocrats want universal access to vote-by-mail.'' Well, I am not sure \nwhat is wrong with vote-by-mail. We are going to talk about that \nbecause I am not sure what is wrong with vote-by-mail.\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n  Seriously, I have seen it over the 20 years I have been in office \nexpanded in our State and in Oregon and now used as the majority of the \nway that people vote. And so I don't take kindly to his comments or to \nthe former President's comments that somehow this is a fraudulent \nsystem. It is not.\n  (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Madam President, first of all--I have got a lot of charts here, so \nyou will have to excuse us.\n  First of all, when you get a voter registration form for vote-by-\nmail, it says right on the form you must be a citizen of the United \nStates of America to vote. You must be 18 years of old the next \nelection, or--yeah, or 18 before the special election. That is what it \nsays right on the form. There is no mistaking about it. There is no \nifs, ands, or buts about it.\n  You are going to sign your name and attest to these issues. In fact, \nthe attestation basically says, ``Knowingly providing false information \nabout yourself or the qualifications for voter registration is a class \nC felony, punishable by imprisonment or a fine up to $10,000, or \nboth.'' That is a pretty hefty fine. That is a pretty serious issue. I \ndon't think most people are going to say, ``Oh, I want to help \nperpetrate voter fraud because I want to go to jail or I want to pay \nthis fine.''\n  And the notion that somebody illegally in the United States is going \nto sign up for this--most of these people are just trying to earn an \nincome and stay on a low profile. I don't think any of them--if you are \nan illegal immigrant and you sign up for vote-by-mail and you vote-by-\nmail, you will be deported. You will be deported.\n  So I don't think people are out there doing this voluntarily because \nthey think this is some great way to gain the system. In fact, the \nstatistics just done by a major report shows that there is less than 1 \npercent of voter fraud in this system. It is not really this notion \nthat the former President would like to perpetrate.\n  Well, the biggest reason why vote-by-mail works is what is here, but \nyou don't see it. I guess I should sign my name--because right here, I \ndeclare the facts on this registration form are true. I am a citizen of \nthe United States. I live at this address, for at least the last 30 \ndays before the election which I am going to vote in. I am old enough \nto vote in that election, and I understand the jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Corrections; you can't currently be serving a sentence \nfor a felony conviction or incarcerated for a federally or out-of-state \nFederal conviction.\n  OK. Right there, you have to sign your name right below that. So this \nattestation and requirement--oh, by the way, part of the requirement on \nthe form that you get is you also have to put in your driver's license \nor an I.D.\n  Now, in many States, you are moving to this enhanced driver's license \nrequirement, which you have to prove you are a citizen of the United \nStates. Not every application you get at a driver's license office you \nhave to prove that, but this is the information on your voter \nregistration card that you have to prove that you are attesting to the \nfact that you are a citizen of the United States. It is information \nthat can be searched.\n\n  So, now, we come to the actual ballot. I don't know if we have a copy \nof the ballot here. Well, we will have to go grab one of those. But on \nyour ballot, you do the same thing. You get a ballot. Your ballot has \nto have that signature on it. You vote who you say you are going to \nvote for. You put it in a privacy envelope. You stick it in another \nenvelope. And you mail it in. So at the county auditor, they match that \nsignature that you signed on your voter registration card with the \nsignature on that ballot. And that is how they know you are who you say \nyou are.\n  Now, that is no different, really, from most of the way voting has \nworked in our country for decades. When you go into the polling place, \nthey ask you for your name. You go to a book, if you noticed, your name \nand address were there, in a blank space. And they say, Sign your name.\n  Most Americans probably never noticed at the top of that page was \nalso an attestation that said, ``If you are lying about who you are, \nyeah, you are going to pay a fine, and you are going to jail.''\n  So when you went to a polling place and you signed your signature, \nthey went back and saw it was the signature that you had on your \nregistration card. So vote-by-mail is replicating that same system. An \napplication card matched to a signature on your ballot. And that is \nwhat happened.\n  Now, that is not to say there isn't attempts at fraud, not to say \nthat there isn't attempts at monkey business, because there is. But it \nsays the system is based on something that is safe and secure and can \nbe validated. I am going to shock some people, I am sure, by saying \nthis, but when I went to vote in the last election, somebody had \nrequested several ballots in my name--several ballots in my name. I am \nsure it was ill intent. There was nothing good about it.\n  And when I looked to see that they hadn't counted my ballot, even \nthough I had voted very early in the process, I became alarmed and \ncalled the auditor and said, ``Why haven't you counted my ballot?''\n  And he said, ``Several people have filed ballots under your name.''\n  I am sure there was ill intent and monkey business by somebody. So I \ndecided I am going down to the courthouse to see what this was all \nabout. But by the time I got there, the auditor had sorted it out and \nsaid, ``I found the one signature that matches your signature, and we \nhave counted your ballot.''\n  So if they hadn't done that, they probably threw it in a pile--``Oh, \nwe got 10 ballots under this name''--whatever it was. Why did that \nhappen? I don't know. But I know the system worked because he pulled \nthem all aside and, when he got to it, they matched my name with the \nballot that existed.\n  Now, for us in Washington, because we have had some very close \nelections, the vote-by-mail system has got a lot of scrutiny. We got a \nlot of scrutiny in a Governor's race a few years after I got elected, \nand the race got down to several hundred votes, really, I think in the \nend. It was several hundred votes.\n  And we had people admitting that they had voted for dead spouses. We \nhad all sorts of things at the end, when people knew that the level \nof--most elections aren't that close. But when you are down to hundreds \nof votes and you know that there is going to be scrutiny, the system \nworks. It doesn't mean there won't be a mistake somewhere and that you \nwon't have to redo the count and find it. It doesn't mean that there is \nabsolutely zero, zero, zero, zero fraud.\n  It means that there is a system based on a safe and secure measure \nand that you can go back and check it. Now, I love our vote-by-mail \nsystem, and the voters are proving it, at 84 percent turnout in the \nlast Presidential election. Sometimes, in off-year elections, we get as \nhigh as 70 percent turnout. So it is working in off-year elections.\n  Who is not for empowerment and enfranchisement of people? Apparently, \nNewt Gingrich isn't because he thinks it is a mastermind theory or some \nscenario where we are going to try to take over the world when, in \nreality, I would say it is the next phase of voting, particularly in an \nera of pandemic and that we need to have our elections be more secure.\n  I would say that if people are going to fool around and create \ndistrust in your election system, have a system where you get to tear \noff a tab and keep it at home and know that your ballot was cast and \nknow that you can count it and know that you can count it again.\n  In my election when I won by 2,229 votes, the tallies weren't the \nsame each time. They weren't. It changed. It didn't mean they were \nwrong. It just meant that various mistakes were made, they verified \ntheir work, and they were corrected. But my predecessor did not \nundermine the U.S. democracy by claiming he lost. He didn't go out and \ntry to pass voter suppression laws. He came back here and worked on the \n9/11 commission with all of us and tried to defend our country.\n  But that is not where we are today. We are here with Mr. Trump--\nPresident Trump--and on January 6, I sat outside and listened to the \nPresident. I really thought, ``I am going to go ahead and give a speech \nthat night.'' I had no idea what was going to happen to us.\n\n  I thought I was just going to speak on the floor that night. I \nthought that\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nwas it. I had no idea that we were going to face an insurrection. So I \nwas taking notes, I thought I was going to give the speech. Turns out, \nI didn't get to give that speech. We had kind of a truncated session \nthat night. We give a few speeches. A few people talked. But I didn't \ngive a big speech.\n  I have been waiting to give this speech for a long time. I have been \nwaiting to repudiate what the President said at his rally for a long \ntime. And the reason is because I cannot stand to have our election \nsystem, the basis of our democracy, the basis of our country, why we \nare the gold standard around the world--I am not sure anybody should go \non a codel anymore to witness an election in another country until we \nget our election system right here.\n  What are you going to say when you get there? What are you going to \nsay if you are going to go to another country and witness their \nelection? ``We know how to do it in the United States''? Because right \nnow we are not proving that. We are showing that we can't move forward \non the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n  Let's go over what President Trump said that night because President \nTrump claimed that--his first claim that the Michigan secretary of \nstate flooded the State with unsolicited mail-in ballots sent to \neverybody on the rolls in direct violation of State law. That is what \nhe said last, that is what he said. That is what he said at his rally. \n``Go down there. Go down there.''\n  You know, there is moments in this craziness when you realize there \nare people who will stand up. And I am not trying to embarrass anybody, \nbut I was probably the last person to leave this Chamber, and the \nParliamentarian refused to let anyone touch the ballots, even though \nshe could barely walk down the hall, even though she could barely carry \nall those supplies.\n  She knew that allowing anybody else to touch these certifications of \nthe election would give somebody the claim that, somehow, somebody had \ninterfered. So people were doing their job, and in this case, the \nsecretary of state, in response to a 2018 vote by the people of \nMichigan, they approved, in a vote by the people, a no-excuse absentee \nvoting law. That is what the people of Michigan voted for.\n  So the secretary of state sent out ballots. Some people didn't like \nthat. Some people challenged it. And in September of 2020, the Michigan \ncourt of appeals upheld the decision that the secretary of state, \nciting the Constitution and their authority over elections, that they \nhad the authority to mail those ballots.\n  The supreme court of Michigan didn't take up that case. They didn't \nrefute it. So it is false. He is trying to say mail-in ballot \napplications were illegally sent. It is not true. The people voted for \nit. The secretary of state did her job. The courts upheld it.\n  He tried to say 17,000 ballots were cast by deceased voters. OK. I \nmean, to say nothing of the fact that there are probably a lot of \npeople with the name of John Brown in Michigan, there are a lot of \npeople by the same name. But there is a system that uses the Social \nSecurity Administration to flag death of deceased voters. And ballots \nin this case of those who have died are not counted in the Michigan \nelection.\n  In the State of Washington, if you cast a ballot and you mailed it \nand you die 2 days later and the election is not until the next week, \nyour vote counts. Now, your spouse can't cast it after you die and say, \n``My wife intended to vote for so-and-so.'' No, no, no.\n  But once you fill the ballot out and you put it in the mailbox or \nballot box, your vote is good, even if you die the next day. That is \nour State--in Michigan, no. So they did not do this. They did not have \nthis claim that the President had.\n  And then he claimed the turnout in Wayne County was 137 percent of \nregistered voters--or 139 percent, somewhere in there--also not true. \nIn Wayne County, it was 61 percent of the vote of more than 1.4 million \nregistered voters. So all that he said about Michigan that night was \nfalse. It was false. And the courts upheld it. It was just a big lie.\n  Let's go to the Presiding Officer's State. Let's go to Wisconsin. \nTrump claimed 170,000 absentee ballots were counted without a valid \nabsentee ballot application. Now, the President knows that her State is \ninfamous--famous, appreciated, for the same-day voting. And in \nMilwaukee and Dane Counties, a total of 170,000 people did vote \nabsentee ballot, in person in the 2020 election.\n  They filled out an absentee ballot application, located in the \nenvelope like I showed, and sent in the ballot. So they know who those \npeople are. They know that they were legitimate voters. They didn't \nvote without an application. They filled out the application as well. \nSo this, too, is part of the Big Lie.\n  And then Trump claimed that 100,000 ballots were backdated by U.S. \nPostal workers. That is what he claimed. The U.S. Postal Service \nInspector General investigation to the allegations in all of the USPS \nworkers and contractors refuted these allegations. There was no \nevidence--there was no evidence. There was no evidence that that \noccurred.\n  And then the famous thing that the other side of the aisle constantly \ntalks about--which I just don't--I don't understand--ballot harvesting. \nThey think that, somehow, this is going to lead to ballot harvesting.\n  So Donald Trump claimed that Madison had 19,000 ballots collected by \nhuman dropboxes. I don't even know what a human dropbox is. I don't \nknow what he means by a human dropbox or operatives. Well, facing \ninflux, Madison and the city clerk held a pair of events in which \npeople could go to a park and drop off their absentee ballots at \nstations set up and staffed by poll workers.\n  What is wrong with us if we are trying to make it harder to vote in \nAmerica? What is the premise? If the premise is that you want to \ncertify that people are actual citizens of the United States, great. We \nhave a system. If you want to certify they live there, great. We have a \nsystem. We have a fine. We have a penalty. We have a way to investigate \nthem. We have a way to catch fraud.\n  So what is it? You just want to make it harder to vote? No, no, no. \nDemocracies are about enfranchising the vote. It is a constant effort. \nThe same things we did in 1920 don't apply in 2020. In 2020, it is an \ninformation age, and we had a pandemic.\n  What is wrong with making the vote available to people? So the ballot \nharvesting, that he claims, did not happen. That is also part of his \nspeech that night. He went on for 45 minutes. He went on for 45 \nminutes, whipping people up to come down here and attack the Capitol \nbased on these lies that weren't true--big lies that weren't true.\n  Then he went on to Georgia. He claimed over 10,000 ballots in Georgia \nwere cast by individuals whose names and birth dates matched Georgia \nresidents who died in 2020 prior to the election. He later revised that \ndown. He was like, ``Oh, wait. No, that is too high.'' He said it was \n5,000. And the State election board in Georgia conducted a \ncomprehensive investigation of deceased voters submitting ballots and \nfound four cases--four cases. Four cases.\n  Again, I don't know what Georgia's law is. I don't know if it is like \nWashington, I don't know if it is like Michigan's, I don't know what it \nis like but they found four people. But it wasn't 5,000; it wasn't \n10,000. Trump claimed that there were 66,000 people that were under the \nage of 18 who voted.\n  I think this has gotten a lot of attention because I think there is \nbeen some public accounting of this in the press. I think the secretary \nof state refuted this several times. But in general, the secretary of \nstate said that there were zero individuals under 18 who voted in the \nelection based upon a comparison of people who voted in the 2020 \nelection in Georgia to their full birth dates. So that also was \nrefuted.\n\n  And then Trump claimed--I showed you that attestation on the \nWashington ballot, the certification that you have to sign, what it \nsays. You can't vote if you are incarcerated or a felon. So Trump \nclaimed that there were 2,500 ballots cast by incarcerated felons in \nGeorgia prison. So there was no mass incarcerated voting of felons.\n  They did investigate and did find 74 potential felons who they think \ncould have cast a ballot. And guess what happened? They pulled them, so \nthey weren't counted. That is how the system works. That is how the \nsystem works. That is what you are supposed\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nto do. That is why you have the system. So just like the other States--\nno, those voter claims were false.\n  OK. Let's go to Arizona, also another claim. He has made a lot of \nclaims since then, but I am just focusing on the ones mostly from that \nevening because that is what sent people down here and, now, that is \nwhat sent us on where we are with candidates all across America \npledging Trump-think to run for office, which is undermining our \nelection system and undermining our democracy. And all I want is our \ncolleagues to work together on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. That \nis all I want.\n  This can't be more tumultuous than 1965. I am not saying that the \nformer President isn't stirring up a lot. He is. But I have got to \nbelieve that we can work together. So he said 36,000 ballots were \nillegally cast by noncitizens.\n  Why am I going through this? Because I get a little tired of \neverybody just saying, ``Oh, the courts decided. The courts decided. He \nwas wrong, the courts decided. He was wrong.''\n  No, no, no. People need to have faith in the system. We need to work \nto build faith in the system. We need to work in a bipartisan fashion \nto build faith in the system, and we need to stop the discrepancies \nbetween States.\n  The 2020 turnout in Washington was 87 percent; Alaska, 60 percent; \nWest Virginia, 63 percent; Georgia, 66 percent; and Wisconsin, 72 \npercent. I don't know. I think it is probably a little higher. I don't \nknow. Preclearance was based on that there was 20 percent difference in \nStates voting; 20 percent difference still exists today. How are we \nworking to protect our democracy and enhance voting rights if we are \nhere trying to suppress those rights through these various State \nactions?\n  So in Arizona, the President said 36,000 ballots were illegally cast \nby noncitizens. Well, I showed you that attestation that you have to \nsign that basically says you are going to jail or you are going to be \ndeported or you are going to pay a fine. And in Arizona, the Supreme \nCourt basically had previously struck down a law requiring that proof, \nand so they did submit proof of their--they do submit and attest to \ntheir citizenship. So they do attest to their citizenship, and since \nthen, Arizona has further enhanced their laws.\n  And 22,000 ballots were returned that were scheduled to be mailed \nout. I love this all the time--I love this all the time, this notion \nthat, somehow, somebody leaked a bunch of ballots, as if they all don't \nhave a barcode on them. They all have a barcode on them that you know \nwhere they are. They have a number attached to them.\n  But because we have so many people who vote overseas or vote even \nhere in the Washington, DC, area--some of my staff here get a ballot \nearlier than I would get a ballot at my home in Edmonds, WA, and the \nreason is because they know that they live here and it takes a long \ntime to get the ballot and get it back to the secretary of state.\n  So they are probably referring to ballots that were being mailed out. \nThe claim was really just a misreading of data that parties that mailed \nin the ballot on the first day that literally could have been overseas \nballots before the ballots actually went out because a previous batch \nof ballots were already sent.\n  There was a claim that there were more than 11,000 ballots cast, the \nnumbers of registered voters in the same State in the 2020 election. \nThe secretary of state reported 3.4 million votes were cast out of 4.3 \nmillion registered voters for a turnout of 79 percent.\n  So there weren't more--there might have been at some moment. I mean, \none of the things that you see in close elections, particularly in our \nState because it takes a long time to count vote-by-mail, because, \nagain, you are doing the verification of signatures, is counties will \nlist how many ballots that they have left. No county ever overestimates \nhow many ballots they have.\n  They don't know because you are still getting them in because of the \nvote-by-mail. Nobody says they have more ballots than they do because \nthen everybody is going to say, ``Where are those ballots,'' so people \nunderestimate the number of ballots. The consequence is you have \ndifferent numbers that come in every day.\n  It doesn't mean there is something wrong with the system--the system, \nagain, based on your signature, on your registration, on your \nattestation. Again, it is not to say there won't be less than a decimal \npercent of 1 percent fraud. There will be some things that happen, but \nit is not pervasive to the system. And there is a way to catch them. \nThere is a way to penalize them.\n\n  And 150,000 voters were registered in Maricopa County without voter \nregistration deadline--after the deadline had passed. And a Federal \njudge, basically, in that case, cited the impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic, and there were 20,000 ballots that basically were registered \nafter October 5. The court legally extended that deadline because of \nCOVID-19.\n  So the notion that these were all illegal, you may not have liked the \ncourt decision--I know the former President does not like the court \ndecision, but this is what the court decided in these cases. These are \nwhat voters decided, what States decided. He just doesn't like the \noutcome of the system.\n  And the reason why we are here today on the John Lewis Voting Rights \nAct and to try to pass these laws is because our country, based on a \ndemocracy, knows that enfranchisement, voter enfranchisement, is \nsomething that we have to constantly be working for. I talked about a \ncouple of companies earlier. I would like to talk about a few more, if \nI could.\n  The reason I am saying this is because, right now, we need to unite \nthe free press, the business community, the general public, everybody \nwe can, to say, Let's get behind free and fair elections. Let's get \nbehind the verification of the system. And let's strengthen the \ndemocracy we have in the United States of America.\n  But what did Best Buy say? They support the John Lewis Act. They say, \n``An election cannot be free or fair if every eligible voter is not \ngiven a full chance to vote or if the law exists that make it harder \nfor them to do so.''\n  Michael Dell basically said, ``Those rights, especially for women, \ncommunities of color, have been hard-earned. Government should ensure \ncitizens have their voices heard. HB-6 does the opposite, and we are \nopposed to it.''\n  PayPal, an organization, said, ``The passage of the John Lewis Voting \nRights Advancement Act of 2021 is pending now in the U.S. Senate and \nwill be an important step towards making free and fair access to voting \na reality for all.''\n  These are all corporations who know the importance of doing business \nin the United States, the importance of a democracy, and they have to \nbe scared about what they are seeing. They got people coming up on \nstages in rallies all over the United States basically saying, ``I will \noverturn the 2020 election.''\n  Do you think people want to do businesses in countries like that? No. \nPeople want to do business in stable countries where you have a free \nand fair election and you keep going. That is the beauty of the \ndemocracy--the people have spoken, as I talked about earlier.\n  Microsoft, they are really trying to rally everybody: ``We hope that \ncompanies will come together and make it clear that a healthy business \nrequires a healthy community. A healthy community requires that \neveryone have the right to vote conveniently, safely, and securely.''\n  So they obviously get it. They know what this is about.\n  Salesforce, another organization, they basically have said, ``As \nvoting rights have come under attack in places like Georgia and Texas, \nwe have used our platform to advocate for the right to vote based on \nnonpartisan principles and action.''\n  Let's go, the Greater Phoenix Leadership--GPL--``Disenfranchising \nvoters is not election reform. These efforts are misguided and must be \ndefeated.''\n  And this was in an op-ed opposing Arizona Senate bills 1485, 1593, \nand 1713. And it was signed by 50 Arizona business leaders. The reason \nI am saying this is because these businesses right now are leading the \ncharge on efforts to try to stop these voter suppression tactics in \nStates, and they are trying to tell us, ``Hey, you guys do the same \nthing here, please. You guys please join the effort and do the same \nthing here, please.''\n\n  There is another--well, Coca-Cola, I think they have been pretty \nclear, although we should see what they say.\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nThis is a statement on Georgia's voting legislation. They say, ``We \nwant to be crystal clear and state unambiguously that we are \ndisappointed in the outcome of Georgia's voting legislation. Our focus \nis now supporting Federal legislation that protects voting access and \naddresses the voter suppression across the country.''\n  Major League Baseball, they have been pretty clear on this. There is \nbeen quite a debate about this. It happened--you know, I don't know \nwhat is going to happen this week. I don't know what is going to \nhappen. But I know when we raised questions about the Washington \nFootball Team and spoke directly to the team, we said, ``This is the \nwrong approach. You need to change.'' They said, ``We don't want to.''\n  In the end, the business community, supported by many Native American \norganizations, the business community told the Washington team it was \ntime to change. So the business community is telling us here, Do not \nsuppress the rights of voters in the United States of America.\n  So we may not be successful here, but I guarantee you the business \ncommunity will continue to be loud about this because they know that \nvoter suppression and undermining democracy is undermining healthy \ncommunities here in the United States.\n  So ``Major League Baseball fundamentally supports the rights for all \nAmericans and opposes restrictions at the ballot box.''\n  And the Black Economic Alliance, this was a statement on the Georgia \nvoting legislation signed by 72 Black economic and business leaders: \n``While the use of police dogs, poll taxes, literacy tests and other \novertly racist voter suppression tactics are a thing of the past, \nGeorgia and other States are rushing to impose new and substantial \nburdens on voting laws following an election that produced record \nturnout for both parties. The disproportionate racial impact of these \nallegedly `neutral laws' should neither be overlooked nor excused. The \nstakes for our democracy are too high to remain silent or on the \nsidelines.''\n  So all of these organizations--I want to just end with one last one, \nthe Civic Alliance. The Civic Alliance is an organization signed by \n1,200 member companies that basically said: ``If our government is \ngoing to work for us, for all of us, each of us must have equal freedom \nto vote, and elections must reflect the will of the people. We cannot \nelect leaders in every state capital and Congress to work across the \naisle. We call on elected leaders in every capital and in Congress to \nwork across the aisle and ensure that every eligible American has the \nfreedom to easily cast their ballot and participate fully in our \ndemocracy.''\n  So these are the statements of people who are ringing the bell of \nconcerns about voter suppression across the United States of America. \nThese are the people who are saying it is time for us to act. They are \nnot saying, Figure it out in a few years. They are not saying, This is \nsomething you can deal with later. They are asking us to act now.\n  Usually, the business community doesn't get that involved in stating \nlegislation by House and Senate bill numbers. They usually don't do \nthat. They are usually a little more reticent. They are not reticent \nnow because they know doing business in a democracy is way better than \nin some scenario of voter suppression.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join us in getting this done. I see my \ncolleague who has been the leader on this effort overall, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, and I thank her for her leadership on this issue. This \nhas been a hard-fought battle and something she has put a lot of energy \ninto, and I want to personally thank her for that leadership and \ncontinuing to fight this fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I think I will start just by returning to \nthe 1800s and a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Sumner. Senator \nSumner later played a key role in the civil rights debate, which is why \nI am returning to that story. I think it is a story about the Senate \nfloor.\n  Sumner gave a speech about Kansas being admitted into the Union, and \nhe was a Republican Senator who called out two Democratic Senators, \ninsulting one of them. And a Representative from the House of \nRepresentatives, on the other end of this corridor, came over here. His \nname was Preston Brooks, and he took considerable offense, and he \nproceeded to come to the Senate floor and cane Senator Sumner. Senator \nSumner was gravely injured, but he did recover--recovering slowly. He \nserved for another 18 years, which leads me to the fact that he \nproceeded to put forward civil rights legislation in 1875--in 1875--150 \nyears ago--almost 150 years ago, 145 years ago.\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n  And so he argued after the Civil War that our Black Americans were \nbeing discriminated against and it needed to end; that anyone should go \ninto any public accommodation and be treated equally here in the United \nStates of America--a Constitution that says: All men--and let's include \nwomen--are created equally.\n  So he put forward this bill, and it said that every person gets equal \naccess to theaters, to public schools, to churches, to cemeteries, \nequal opportunity to serve in jury duty, and that any suits brought in \nthis regard would be tried in Federal court, not State court, so we \ncould enforce a Federal standard of nondiscrimination across this land.\n  Sumner died of a heart attack in 1874. He had put forward this \noriginally as an amendment--actually, an introduction in 1870, as a \nbill. He died before it could be passed. As he was dying, he pleaded \nwith Frederick Douglass and others at his bedside: You must take care \nof my civil rights bill.\n\n  In the months following his death, the Senate did act, and they \nsupported that bill, and it was passed into law in 1875. At that \nmoment, it would be hard to envision that, after I was born, we would \nstill be fighting for equal access to public accommodations. The Senate \npassed that bill and made it into law in 1875. But the Supreme Court of \nthe United States struck down that law 8 years later. Boom--equal \naccess in America supported by the elected Representatives in the House \nand the Senate was blown to smithereens by a Supreme Court of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Well, that did set the stage for another civil rights battle, and it \nwas 1890. It was after Benjamin Harrison's successful Presidential \ncampaign, in which he promised election reform and election integrity \nbecause, you see, anyone looking at our Republic would know that we are \nall affected, no matter what State we come from, by the integrity of \nthe elections in the other States. There has to be integrity in all of \nthem for this U.S. Senate to have integrity. There has to be integrity \nin all of the State elections for that House of Representatives down \nthe hall to have integrity.\n  So Benjamin Harrison was elected campaigning on this type of reform. \nAnd there was a Senator, Senator George Hoar, who championed amendments \nor an attempt to bolster national protections for Federal elections. It \nwas particularly targeted at stopping voter suppression that had really \narisen in the southern part of the United States following the Civil \nWar. So this bill, known commonly as the Lodge bill, also known as the \nfederal elections bill, passed the House of Representatives in 1890.\n  What did this bill do? It allowed citizens from any district to \npetition a Federal circuit court to appoint Federal supervisors for \ncongressional elections in case of efforts to suppress the vote by \nlocal officials. It permitted the Federal Government to appoint \nsupervisors to oversee all phases of Federal elections, including voter \nregistration and the certification of the election results to make sure \nthere were no shenanigans at the State level that would corrupt the \ncore vision of equal representation, the core foundation of integrity \nof elections. It is the foundation of the vision of the legitimacy and \nthe production of government of, by, and for the people.\n  And this bill even enabled Federal election supervisors to request \ndeputy U.S. marshals, as necessary, to protect the ballot box for every \ncitizen to have access. It passed the House of Representatives, and it \ncame here to the Senate, and it failed because they couldn't get \nunanimous consent to close debate. At that time, there was no cloture \nmotion.\n  The Senators, in 1805, had gotten rid of the prior question rule, \nwhich would have allowed debate to be closed because they had a social \ncontract. That social contract was that we listen to everyone to get \ntheir perspectives. People can speak, not once, but twice on a \nquestion. They can speak for as long we wanted to listen to everyone \nand then we take a vote. That was the social contract.\n  But this filibuster broke that social contract because everyone was \nlistened to, but you couldn't get unanimous consent to close debate and \nso the bill died. It had the support of the people of the United States \nof America through their elected representatives down the hall. It had \nthe support of this Senate to protect the fundamental right to vote in \nour Nation by the majority of this body here in the U.S. Senate. But \nthe social contract was broken to block Black Americans from voting; to \nallow States and local election officials to rig the registration \nsystem so you could never sign up; to allow intimidators to gather at \nthe polls to keep Black Americans from getting through them to put \ntheir ballot in the box.\n  I would like to say that all traces of inequality in voting are gone \nfrom America. I would like to say that. And, indeed, that was \nreasonably true--reasonably true--through the recent years, before the \nSupreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, because any changes in your \nvoting rules had to be preapproved in States that engaged in these \nintimidating practice. I say ``reasonably true'' because the real fact \nis there was still a significant blemish in our elections, and that is, \non election day, in certain States and certain precincts, there was a \ngame being played to make it harder for some citizens to vote than \nother citizens to vote.\n  The game worked like this: If you have an area where you want low \nturnout, you proceed to create a big precinct so that there are a lot \nof people who have to go to that one place to vote. And if you have a \ndesire to encourage the people in another precinct to vote, a White \nprecinct, you create smaller precincts so the voting line won't be as \nlong.\n  And then there were other tricks like, for example, understaffing the \nvoting precinct where it is predominantly Black Americans to make it \nharder for them to vote and making sure you staff really well the \nprecinct where you want the White Americans to vote.\n  And there were other tricks, as well. For example, relocating the \nvoting location in the Black precinct so that people go to the wrong \nplace, or putting it where parking is virtually impossible so it is \nmuch harder to get to the poll, or putting out false information about \nthe date and the location of the voting.\n  These things are all wrong. Voter suppression exists today. And it \nwas powerful to see how a couple tools have greatly reduced those \ntricks and traps.\n  One of those tools is early voting. If you have an early voting \nperiod, it is hard to create long lines. It is hard to sustain wrong \ninformation about where to go. It is very difficult to deny people the \nability to vote simply by having too few staffers.\n  Even more so, vote-by-mail is powerful. Now, we have Republican \nStates like Utah that have vote-by-mail, and they love it. And it \nelects Republicans. You have more blue States like Oregon that have \nvote-by-mail, and they love it. That is my home State.\n  I was really struck, when I was first running for the Oregon State \nLegislature--it was 1998, and we still voted at the precincts' voting \npolls, except the Republican Party had said: We can increase turnout if \nwe get all the Republicans to sign up for absentee ballots. So they got \na high percentage of Republicans to sign up for absentee ballots. Then \nthe Democrats said: Well, OK, yes, we can get Democrats to sign up for \nabsentee ballots. So 50 percent of the electorate in 1998 in Oregon was \nvoting by mail and 50 percent, polls.\n  As I went door to door in my first race for the Oregon House and \nasked people what they liked and didn't like, they normally said: What \nI really hate is that we have too many potholes, and I am not happy \nwith city hall. What I really like is my absentee ballot.\n  I would say: Well, why is that?\n  They would say: Well, you know, I don't have to worry about where to \npark, and I don't have to worry about long lines. Do you know what \nelse? It is a complicated set of issues under the initiative system we \nhave in Oregon, and I can be able to sit at my table, study them, \ndiscuss them with my spouse, and have my children come to the table and \nsee what we are doing.\n  Well, these two tools really opened the doors to the election process \nin the last election, and the response of my Republican colleagues was: \nOh, no, we can't let that happen. We don't want those people to vote. \nWe better rein in vote-by-mail. We better rein in voter registration.\n  Georgia got rid of voter registration in between the main election \nand the\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nrunoff because 70,000-plus Georgians registered in that period, and \nthey think it helped Democrats more than Republicans. So, in a \nprejudicial way, they said: Let's make registration harder.\n  Well, it is not acceptable in our country to erect barriers for \ntargeted communities--not for Black Americans, not for Hispanic \nAmericans, not for college students, not for young voters, and not for \nNative American reservations--not for anyone.\n  But why are those groups being targeted in a surgical way by the \nstrategies in State after State after State with Republican \nlegislatures and Republican Governors? Because those constituencies \ntend to vote more often for Democrats than Republicans. So they are \nstealing the vote of millions of Americans. They are corrupting the \nelection process for millions of Americans.\n  We stand here today in the Senate with the same issue we were \ndebating in 1890 and 1891. The House had set national standards so \nevery American could vote, and the Senate would not give unanimous \nconsent to get to a final vote and contributed to eight-plus decades of \ndiscrimination in our country, of corrupted elections in our country--\nuntil the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I see a colleague here preparing to speak, and I haven't even begun \nmy real speech yet. I am going to close to hand the floor to him, my \ncolleague from Maryland, but let me summarize a couple points before I \ndo so.\n  I believe the Senate is far better off when the minority has the \npower to slow things down. I think that is value, to be able to have \nleverage to get amendments; to be able to negotiate a compromise; to be \nable to make sure a technical bill has been examined by experts and you \nunderstand what it really does; to make sure we have seen all the \nprovisions; to make sure the public has seen all the provisions; to \nmake sure the press has been able to investigate the provisions. All of \nthat is incredibly positive, and it is why, whether I have been in the \nminority or been in the majority, I have argued we need to sustain 60 \nvotes to close debate, and I still hold that position now--60 votes to \nclose debate by a vote.\n  There have traditionally been four ways that a debate on the floor \ncomes to a conclusion.\n  The first is a break in the debate. At that point, I was struck when \nI asked the experts ``Is the Chair allowed to call the question?'' and \nI was told that not only can they call the question, they have a \nresponsibility to call the question when there is a break in the \ndebate. So a break in the debate is one.\n  The second is by unanimous consent. Everyone agrees we have been at \nthis long enough. Let's do four more amendments and then go to final \npassage, and there is a unanimous consent agreement to do that. We \nstill do that quite often.\n  The third is to have a vote on closing debate, and we have to get 60 \nvotes. It is not a ratio of those who show up to vote. So the irony is, \nthose who want a debate often don't show up. You can have a vote 59 to \n5, and the 59 lose. You have to get 60 votes.\n  The fourth is rule XIX, which says every Senator gets to speak twice. \nNow, as far as I am aware, there has never been a debate in the U.S. \nSenate that was finally brought to a close by everyone using up their \ntwo speeches, but it always hovers there, saying there is an eventual \nability to vote on the question.\n  These are the four traditional strategies. We need to apply those \nfour strategies to a period of debate addressing final passage of the \nbill. The cloture motion would still be there. The possibility of a UC \nwould still be there. A break in the debate would still be a break in \nthe debate, and a UC would be a UC. All four tools would still be \nthere, but we would be addressing final passage.\n\n  The problem we have--a little kind of behind-the-scenes complexity of \nSenate rules--is that in the modern Senate, there is always a pending \namendment. So you can't actually get to final passage unless you have a \nperiod of debate dedicated to final passage, and breaking the debate \nwould call the question on the amendment, not final passage.\n  This means that those who want more debate could hold the floor for \nweeks and weeks on something they are determined to keep presenting to \nthe American public, but it brings in the public. It brings in the \npublic. They can weigh in on whether we are heroes or whether we are \nbums. They can weigh in on amendments we say we are going to bring up \nthe next day. They can help us understand how folks back home feel.\n  There is no public in the no-show, no-effort, invisible filibuster we \nhave had since 1975. There is no public, and there are no amendments \nbecause amendments require a supermajority to close debate. Someone \nsays: Well, I am not going to agree to that until my amendment gets up. \nThere is no longer a social contract: You do your amendment. I will do \nmy amendment. We will all do them. They will be on topic.\n  It is gone. So the number of amendments has dropped tenfold between \nthe 109th Congress and the 116th Congress. The number of amendments \ndropped more than tenfold over that time period. Instead, the floor \nmanagers negotiate. The leaders negotiate. They produce a list and then \nask everyone to agree to that list, and someone objects: You left out \nmy amendment.\n  So we--a room full of former House Members and industry leaders, \nformer Governors, former speakers of their State house or presidents of \ntheir State senate; all of this talent sitting around here--do nothing \nday after day after day while the invisible, no-show, no-effort \nfilibuster destroys debate in the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  It is our responsibility to restore debate in this Chamber, to \nrestore amendments. The advantages of the restoration are, No. 1, that \nyou have amendments; No. 2, that you have public debate; and No. 3, \nperhaps the most important, you have an incentive for both sides to \nnegotiate, because under the no-show, no-effort, invisible filibuster \nthat we have had since 1975, the minority of either side says: You \nknow, if I can get 41 of our minority Members to agree not to close \ndebate, and all they have to do is not even show up to vote or show up \nto vote if they like but vote no, then the majority can never get \nanything done, and won't that enhance our political power in the \nminority party?\n  That is an almost irresistible temptation in the tribal, partisan \nwarfare of today. So each minority is tempted into basically exercising \na veto over the majority party's policy agenda. That is ``an eye for an \neye makes the whole world blind,'' strategy. The Democrats sabotage the \nRepublican majority. The Republicans sabotage the Democratic majority. \nBut under the public filibuster, not only is the public involved, but \nthe minority has to maintain continuous debate, which can be hard, so \nthey have an incentive to negotiate. The majority, seeing the time \nburned up that they need for other things, other policy bills and \nnominations, they have an incentive to negotiate. So you get \namendments. You get the public involved. Most important, you recreate \nan incentive to negotiate. That is the reinvigorated filibuster \nstrategy, the talking filibuster.\n  Call it the public filibuster or just call it extended debate on \nfinal passage of the bill. Whatever you call it, it is better than the \nparalysis and partisanship that are destroying the Senate's ability to \naddress the questions that face this Nation, and there is no more \nimportant question than defending the right of every citizen to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague \nfrom the State of Washington, Senator Cantwell, for her passion for \npeople and the rights of people to vote, and her willingness to \nactually go through the details of the groups outside of this Congress \nthat feel so strongly about this, including businesses, as pointed out, \nthat understand that you can't do business overseas--having just come \nback from Ukraine, from which I just arrived an hour ago--and uphold \ndemocracies overseas, if we are allowing our democracy to go to \nshambles by allowing voter suppression laws to pass, as they have in \nnumerous States across the country.\n  Just this week, we marked the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and, today, we are considering legislation that goes to the \nvery heartbeat of the democracy--the freedom to vote--that so many have \nfought and died for.\n  We are here because a flood of State laws to roll back voting has \nsurged up since the 2020 elections, when in the 2020 elections, in the \nmiddle of a pandemic, more Americans cast a ballot than ever before. \nThey were willing to take those risks, and the laws were changed in red \nStates and blue States and purple States to allow them to do that.\n  But now what do we see? A rollback. A rollback in the Presiding \nOfficer's great State of Wisconsin. We see rollbacks attempted across \nthe Nation in places like Montana, with same-day registration in place \nfor 15 years. And 8,000 people took avail of it in the last election to \neither change their address or register that way.\n  So then what happens? Well, say the Republican legislature in Montana \nsays: Why don't we get rid of something we have had in place for 15 \nyears? Why don't we do that?\n  Guess what that creates, my friends. Maximum confusion and ultimate \nvoter suppression.\n  With that core freedom of voting now at stake, it is on us to stand \nup and to take up the torch that Dr. King and so many brave Americans \ncarried decades ago and acted to preserve the foundational right of our \ndemocracy. And while that may sound like an ambitious task, it is one \nwithin our reach. By passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, we \ncan meet these challenges and turn back the tide.\n\n  Today, I want to address a topic that has loomed large over this \nhistoric debate, and that has to do with the very rules of this \nChamber.\n  This week, every Member of the Senate will have a chance to cast a \nvote that will determine if this is a legislative body that will rise \nto meet a test. The test is participation and voting. The test is \nactually being able to take on the issues of our day.\n  It won't be the first time. Indeed, four times already this Congress, \nour Republican colleagues have blocked us from even considering \nlegislation to protect the freedom to vote. But we are here again this \nweek. We are here because, to quote Ella Baker, a granddaughter of \nslaves from Virginia who worked alongside some of the great leaders of \nthe civil rights movement, ``We who believe in freedom cannot rest.''\n  So while much has been made of our colleagues who have not committed \nto join us in this effort to change the Senate rules, we must remain \nsteadfast in the truth that the right to vote in this country is not \nnegotiable. We must forge ahead.\n  I want to start by responding to some of the points that have been \nraised as reasons not to move forward with legislation at this \nwatershed moment, as reasons not to do what it takes when it comes to \nprotecting this most sacred of rights--the right to vote.\n  Some have argued that allowing voting rights legislation to pass the \nSenate without clearing a 60-vote threshold would be a mistake that \nwould open the door to somehow leading to wild swings in Federal \npolicy. I am trying to imagine this place ever being involved in such a \nthing given how slowly we go and how many people understandably want to \nmake sure we are careful in how we pass laws, but that is one of the \nthings that have been raised for why we need some kind of a 60-vote \nthreshold, which, of course, is not in the Constitution. The words \n``filibuster'' and ``cloture'' are not in the Constitution. In fact, \nlegislatures across this land, some of which do very good things, do \nnot use a 60-vote threshold. In fact, democracies across the world do \nnot use a 60-vote threshold.\n  The truth is this: We have tried for months to persuade our \nRepublican colleagues to join us in supporting legislation, to work \nwith us, to debate it,\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nbut what they do is they throw a wrench into the process and then \nbasically walk out that door and go home. We don't have that debate \nthat allows us to have amendments and allows us to ultimately have a \nvote on the bill. It is cut off from a vote.\n  When you look at the past when it comes to voting rights, it has been \nbipartisan not even that long ago. But this time--this time--even \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, something that has been law of the \nland and supported on a bipartisan basis, as the President of the \nUnited States pointed out when he was in Atlanta--this time, no. Only \none Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, was willing even to allow \nthe John Lewis bill to come up for a vote.\n  But if our colleagues across the aisle will not work with us, it does \nnot mean--it cannot mean--that we should simply give up. A simple look \nat history makes that clear.\n  As Representative Clyburn has noted in recent weeks, there have been \nmoments in our history when this most fundamental of rights has not \nbeen extended or defended on a bipartisan basis; that is, the right to \nhave these bills come up. He pointed to the 15th Amendment. That, as he \nsaid, was a single-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote. \nThat fact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.\n  I would also say to my colleagues that the real threat facing our \ncountry isn't too much legislation; it is the gridlock and the \nstalemate in which this Chamber is stuck.\n  A number of us were just in Ukraine standing up for democracy, \nstanding up for the right of people across the world to be able to \ndebate issues and make decisions on the most pressing issues of this \ntime. Now we are back here in this Chamber, and we have to have that \nopportunity as well.\n  This misses another key point in the arguments made against changing \nthe rules. When politicians actually have to vote on stuff, voters can \nhold them accountable for these votes.\n  We know that the policies in the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act \nenjoy strong support among the American people. They have been adopted \nin red, blue, and purple States.\n  Look at places like Utah, where for years there has been mail-in \nballoting. Yet, in other States, sadly, it is really hard to do. In \nother States, you have to get a notary just to get an application or \nyou have to get a witness just to get an application even if you have \nCOVID and you are in a hospital. Yet, in many States--red, blue, \npurple--this is in place.\n  We believe--those of us who support the Freedom to Vote Act--that in \nkeeping with the Constitution that says Congress can make or alter the \nlaws regarding Federal elections, that this should be the law of the \nland. It is constitutionally supported, and Americans, no matter what \ntheir ZIP Code, should have the right to vote in a safe way that is \nbest for them.\n\n  Arguing that Senate rules are more important than the right to vote \nignores the very history of this Nation. As Senator Angus King has \nreminded us, in 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge introduced a bill to ensure \nAfrican Americans in the South were not disenfranchised. The bill was \npassed in the House but was blocked by the Senate with a filibuster. \nLodge argued that the Senate should get rid of the filibuster, saying:\n\n       To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and \n     never vote is imbecile.\n\n  I think that kind of says it all quite directly.\n  The Senate chose not to change its rules, and due to repeated \nfilibusters in the years that followed, Congress couldn't pass \nlegislation to enforce the 15th Amendment until nearly 70 years later \nthrough the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n  We have also heard that allowing one party to insist on virtually \nunlimited debate so that you can't vote is an essential part of the \nSenate, but experts from both parties have said this isn't true.\n  Marty Gold, a respected expert on Senate rules who worked for \nRepublican Leader Howard Baker and was staff director of the Senate \nRules Committee, has written:\n\n       The possibility that a minority of Senators could hold \n     unlimited debate on a topic against the majority's will was \n     unknown [in] the first Senate.\n\n  Those are his words.\n  Others have argued that requiring a supermajority, as this filibuster \ndoes now, to pass legislation was an intentional effort to foster \ncompromise, but, again, the historical record simply doesn't back that \nup.\n  The Constitutional Convention heard but did not adopt a proposal to \nrequire a supermajority for legislation. The Framers explicitly decided \nto reserve supermajority requirements for things like constitutional \namendments, treaties, and impeachment.\n  To quote one of them, Benjamin Franklin wrote that a system where \n``the minority overpowers the majority'' would be ``contrary to the \ncommon practice of assemblies in all countries and ages.''\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison:\n\n       It is my principle that the will of the majority should \n     always prevail.\n\n  James Madison was a fierce defender of minority rights, but in 1834, \neven he wrote:\n\n       The vital Principle of Republican Government is . . . the \n     will of the majority.''\n\n  Listening to those words, does it really seem like the Framers of our \nConstitution envisioned a system where a minority of Senators could \nstand in the way of legislation and stop it altogether--stop the vote, \nstop the consideration, throw a wrench into the process, take it off \nthe rails--and then just walk out the door and go home? That is not \nwhat they envisioned.\n  I also want to be clear. Updating the Senate rules to meet the needs \nof this moment isn't some radical break with past precedence. \nThroughout the Senate's history, when faced with unrelenting \nobstruction from the minority, the majority has, in fact, changed the \nSenate rules to allow matters to conclude, to be voted on, not to hang \nin abeyance in perpetuity. In fact, since it was first established in \n1917, the cloture rule has been revised multiple times to make it \neasier to end debate and to force a vote.\n  Now, for friends watching at home, this is what it means: A cloture \nmotion is what allows Senators to bring something to a vote, and under \nthe current rules, it takes 60 Senators to open debate or to pass a \nbill.\n  Here are some examples of how the cloture rule has changed over time:\n  In 1949, cloture was extended to cover all issues pending before the \nSenate, not just bills.\n  In 1975, the vote threshold for cloture was reduced to three-fifths \nof all Senators.\n  In 1979, total postcloture debate was limited to 100 hours, and then \nit was limited again to 30 hours in 1986.\n  In the past decade, the cloture rule has been further reduced for \nvarious kinds of nominees, most recently by our Republican colleagues \nacross the aisle. This isn't something from 100 years ago. This isn't \nsomething from before we had cars and people were arriving here on \nhorseback. This just happened.\n  In addition to changes to the cloture rule itself, the Senate has put \nin place exceptions to the rule. In fact, over time, the Senate has \nestablished over 160 processes and statutes that allow a final vote \nwithout requiring 60 votes for cloture to end debate; in other words, \nyou get to a vote without the 60 votes.\n  As a result, we have expedited procedures, including--get this--\nreconciliation to pass spending and tax legislation; the Congressional \nReview Act to block regulations; disapproval of arms sales. I guess \nsomeone decided that was OK to do for less than 60 votes. Even \napproving compensation plans for commercial space accidents doesn't \nrequire 60 votes, my friends.\n\n  But while the 60-vote threshold was carved up 160 times so Senators \ncould pass things like tax cuts under President Trump, block \nregulations, and confirm Supreme Court Justices, when it comes to \nvoting rights, we are told that tradition and comity mean that we \nshould hug it tight--this old rule--throw voters under the Senate \ndesks, and go home.\n  It is no wonder that our Republican colleagues support for the 60-\nvote threshold rings hollow when their priorities, such as tax cuts and \na Supreme Court nominee, can be passed with a simple majority.\n  Time and time again, the majority in the U.S. Senate has had to \nchange the\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nrules to help pass major legislation. As Senator Merkley has noted time \nand time again, bills we have passed after the majority has modified \nthe rules include the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1977; funding for the \nSelective Service System in 1980; deficit reduction legislation in \n1985; a moratorium on listing new species under the Endangered Species \nAct in 1995; and a change made by the majority in 1996 to the \nreconciliation process, which paved the way for the 2001 and 2003 Bush \ntax cuts and the 2017 Trump tax cuts. When circumstances change, \nSenators have changed the rules time and time again.\n  All of this history clearly shows that the Senate rules are not \nchiseled in stone. That is probably a good thing because the people out \nthere need us to do our jobs. And maybe that is more important than \nsome archaic rule that someone is now abusing. They are not an outside \nforce, these rules, over which we have no control. They are our rules--\nthe Senators' rules, yes, but also the people's rules--written and \nchanged over the years by Senators representing the people of this \ncountry, just like the ones sitting in this Chamber today.\n  As we move forward, I want to make clear that I agree with my \ncolleagues who have said that we must keep the history of this \ninstitution in mind. By the way, I just gave you the history of this \ninstitution--160 carve-outs; time and time again when the rules have \nchanged. That is the true history of this institution.\n  History plainly allows for just this type of action that our \ndemocracy now demands. If we acknowledge the stakes when it comes to \nprotecting the freedom to vote, the cornerstone of our democracy, and \nwe acknowledge the history of the rules of this body, I am left with a \nsimple conclusion: We must update, change, and improve our rules to \nrestore the Senate and meet the moment of our times.\n  Our Nation was founded on the ideals of democracy, and we have seen \nfor ourselves in this building how we can't afford to take that for \ngranted. I certainly saw that this weekend in Ukraine. We cannot afford \nto take any democracy for granted.\n  The world is watching us--watching to see how America is taking on \nthe challenges of the 21st century, including the threats to our \ndemocracy. Around the globe, there are those who see weakness as an \nopportunity. They see weakness in our democracy as an opportunity for \nthem. Those who are hoping that gridlock and paralysis are the defining \nfeatures of America--they are out there, and you can imagine what world \nleaders I am thinking of right now.\n  To put it simply, if we are going to effectively compete with the \nrest of the world, we need a Senate that can do more than just respond \nto crises. We are pretty good at that--tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, \ntsunamis, financial crises, pandemics. OK. We respond to that. But what \nabout the long-term challenges that slowly but surely are eroding this \ndemocracy with voter suppression? There is so much at stake here. We \nmust get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I was asked recently what I think is the \nNo. 1 issue facing America. It is a tough question, and I have had a \nlot of issues race through my mind: inflation, the debt, workforce \nissues, the crisis at our southern border, the explosion of COVID \ncases, the deadly opioid epidemic, a warming planet, Russia and China \nflexing their muscles and creating more volatility around the world. We \nhave got plenty of challenges, don't we? But do you know what I landed \non, what I think is our biggest problem? It is the increasing \ndivision--even polarization--of our politics and our country. It is \nwhat makes it so hard to address all of those other issues that I named \nthat are so important to the families whom we represent.\n  Last week, on the Senate floor, my Democratic colleague from Arizona, \nSenator Sinema, called it a disease of division. Well put. When we are \ntogether, this country can achieve great things and has over the years. \nIt can provide a beacon of hope to a troubled world, but as Lincoln \nwarned, ``a house divided against itself cannot stand.'' In this body, \nwe should be figuring out how to come together to help America stand--\nand stand strong--to address our many challenges.\n  That is why I am so discouraged about what I see playing out on the \nU.S. Senate floor again this week. I have seen an attempt by Democratic \nleadership to fan the flames of distrust. I see an attempt to further \ndivide an already splintered country, both by exaggerated arguments \nbeing made to advance controversial legislation opposed by every single \nRepublican regarding the tough issue of voting and then to try to \nachieve this purely partisan objective by changing a foundation of the \nSenate to dismantle the one Senate rule--the legislative filibuster--\nthat works to bring us together rather than pull us apart.\n  Equally troubling to me is that this seems to be a purely political \nexercise now in that the conclusion seems predetermined. Apparently, \nthe Senate is being dragged through this divisive and ugly partisan \ndebate, knowing that it will not achieve a legislative result but only \na deepening and hardening of the political lines in each camp.\n  Here in the Senate, most Republicans and most Democrats say they want \nto bring the country together. I think they are sincere about that. \nThis message was an explicit part of President Biden's campaign for \nPresident. Yet there is nothing about the harsh, partisan rhetoric from \nthe President's speech on this topic in Atlanta last week or from much \nof the floor debate this week and last week that does anything but push \nour country further apart.\n  First is the substance of the legislative fight. Democrats have been \nhighly critical of those Republicans who refuse to accept the results \nof the 2020 election, pointing out accurately that dozens of lawsuits \nfailed to show adequate fraud to change the result. They have attacked \nsome Republicans because they have said that the election was rigged \nand for questioning the State-by-State certification process that has \nled to deeper rifts in our Nation and a significant number of \nRepublican voters questioning the legitimacy of the election. I get \nthat.\n  So why now are Democratic leaders and President Biden using the exact \nsame language, literally saying the elections are rigged--literally \nsaying that? Why are they perpetrating their own election narrative \nthat does not fit the facts but serves to push both sides deeper into \ntheir own camps and, in particular, now leads Democrats to think that \nelections are illegitimate?\n  Majority Leader Schumer claims ``Republicans are pushing voter \nsuppression and election nullification laws.''\n  President Biden has compared State efforts to tighten up election \nadministration to Jim Crow laws. He has compared Republicans to \nnotorious racists in our history. These attacks are overwrought, \nexaggerated, and deeply divisive.\n  Here is what the nonpartisan and respected group called No Labels has \nsaid about the Democratic attacks:\n\n       If you dig into these [state legislative] proposals you \n     find most entail tightening up procedures pertaining to \n     registration, mail-in absentee voting and Voter ID [laws] \n     that were loosened in 2020 in the name of making it safer for \n     people to vote amid the COVID pandemic. Many leading \n     Democrats and liberal commentators have taken to describing \n     these measures as Jim Crow 2.0, which is to say they are \n     somehow worse than the original Jim Crow era, which entailed \n     poll taxes and literacy tests, violent intimidation of Black \n     voters by the KKK, and even outright prohibition on Black \n     voters participating in party primaries in southern States. \n     To suggest that any voting measures being debated today in \n     America are somehow worse than this is simply irresponsible \n     demagoguery.\n\n  That comes from No Labels, which is a nonpartisan group, Democrats \nand Republicans, trying to find that middle ground.\n  Now, to be fair, this group has been critical of Republican claims of \nwidespread election fraud that cannot be backed up. So what are the \nactual facts?\n  First, the Constitution guarantees all citizens 18 years of age or \nolder the\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nright to vote in elections regardless of race or gender--period.\n  The Federal Voting Rights Act reaffirms that right and makes it \nenforceable in Federal court. In 2006, Congress voted in a bipartisan \nway to reauthorize this important law for 25 years, through 2031. I \nvoted for and strongly support the Voting Rights Act and have long \nsupported other commonsense efforts to increase voter confidence in our \nelections.\n  In fact, there is a bipartisan effort underway right now to deal with \na real problem: to ensure that after the fact, certified elections are \nrespected. This will require making overdue reforms to the Electoral \nCount Act and some other reasonable updates to Federal election \nprocedures. I am happy to be working with a small group of Senate \nDemocrats and Senate Republicans on those efforts. That is how the \nsystem should work. We are not going to agree on everything, but we can \nsit down and talk and find common ground to address problems.\n  What Republicans and most Americans don't support is an unprecedented \nFederal takeover of our election system, which is what the overly broad \nparty-line bills proposed this week by the Democrats will do.\n  Let me be clear. Despite what Democratic leaders are saying to jam \nthese bills through Congress, our democracy is not, as they say, in \ncrisis because it is too hard to vote. We just had a national election \nin 2020 with the highest voter turnout in 120 years. Ninety-four \npercent of voters said it was easy for them to vote. This is according \nto the Pew Research Center--94 percent. That is good.\n  Some have said drastic changes are needed at the Federal level \nbecause the States are now enacting voter restrictions. Some point to \nthe liberal Brennan Center, which reports that 19 States have enacted \nlaws which it characterizes as restricting the right to vote. As noted \nabove--again, by the nonpartisan No Labels group--when you really look \nat these laws, the truth is that they largely make modest changes in \nelection law administration, such as the date that voters may apply for \nmail-in ballots or ensuring voters are who they say they are through \nvoter ID and other signature requirements--something, by the way, the \nvast majority of Americans support.\n  Some of the laws return to State practices closer to the status quo \nbefore the pandemic. As an example, some laws reduced the number of \nballot drop boxes in cases where there were no ballot drop boxes before \nCOVID. And many of the States the Democrats criticize for improving \ntheir elections process are enacting laws similar to those that have \nlong been in place in States represented by Democrats, so-called blue \nStates.\n  For example, under its new law, Georgia has a limit of 17 days of in-\nperson early voting, 17 days. New Jersey and New York have 9 days of \nin-person voting. Connecticut doesn't have any early voting. Georgia \nhas also added one extra Saturday of early voting. Georgia's new \nrequirement that voters provide their driver's license or State ID \nnumbers when applying for mail-in ballots, which Democrats have \ncriticized, is the same as laws in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Rhode \nIsland enacted a voter ID law a decade ago. And with regard to \nPresident Biden's home State, The Atlantic has noted that ``few states \nhave more limited voting options than Delaware.''\n  I, frankly, have not heard Democratic leadership calling out any of \nthese Democrat-majority States for pushing what they deem to be voter \nsuppression.\n  I don't know anyone who doesn't believe it should be easy to vote and \nhard to cheat. Every State has to find that balance, but they have to \nfind it while not violating the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  I don't agree with every policy every State has in place. I find some \ntoo restrictive. As an example, I support no-fault absentee voting, as \nwe do in Ohio. It works well. You don't have to have a reason; you can \nvote absentee. I would like to see every mailbox, in a sense, be a \nballot box, in essence. I find that some of the laws in some of the \nStates lack adequate security, on the other hand. For example, I think \nsome form of ID is smart, as do the vast majority of Americans.\n  But in our Federal system, within the guardrails of the Voting Rights \nAct and consistent with the Constitution, that decision is left up to \nState legislators, closer to the people and accountable to the voters. \nThat is just a fundamental philosophical difference we have here on the \nSenate floor. We see it play out on lots of issues and now on this one.\n  I am very proud of the job that my State of Ohio and our bipartisan \nelection officials in every county do in our elections. In the last \nelection, we had a record 5.97 million Ohioans cast a vote--more voters \nthan ever. It represented 74 percent of eligible voters in our State, \nthe second highest percentage in the history of Ohio. Despite the \nchallenges of running the highest turnout election in our State's \nhistory, during an unprecedented pandemic, it was widely regarded as \nthe most secure and most successful Ohio election ever.\n  Now is not the time to take the responsibility away from Ohio State \nand local officials. Article I, section 4 of the Constitution clearly \nassigns that authority over elections to the States. Alexander Hamilton \nacknowledged in Federalist 59 that only in extraordinary circumstances \nshould the Federal Government become involved in election law, \nexplaining that allowing the Federal Government to run elections would \nhave been a ``premeditated engine for the destruction of State \ngovernments.''\n  We are not in extraordinary circumstances right now. In general, it \nhas become easier and easier to vote in America, and that is a good \nthing. And it has become easier to vote in America than many other \ndemocracies around the world, and that is good too--easy to vote, hard \nto cheat.\n  Despite all the fiery speeches on the floor stating the contrary over \nthe past week, according to a recent survey from Morning Consult, only \n33 percent of American adults think it is too hard for eligible voters \nto vote. A larger share--44 percent--actually think current rules \naren't strict enough. Having heard the debate, this is what voters \nthink.\n  Not only are Democrats attempting a Federal takeover of our election \nsystem, but because they have chosen to change the constitutionally \nbased election system in a purely partisan way, they don't have the 60 \nvotes necessary to get something passed here in the U.S. Senate. That \nis why instead of reaching out to find a bipartisan way forward, they \nare also proposing to fundamentally change the longstanding rules of \nthe Senate. Specifically, they are proposing to do away with what is \ncalled the legislative filibuster in order to advance their Federal \nelection takeover bills by a simple majority instead of the normal 60 \nvotes.\n  This 60-vote margin, the legislative filibuster, is the one tool left \nto encourage bipartisanship not just here in the Senate but in our \nsystem, in the House and at the White House. Yes, it provides important \nminority rights in the Senate that protect the country from legislation \nthat is too far out of the mainstream, and it helps pass good \nlegislation, like Medicare or Social Security with big votes, big \nmargins, that mean those programs can be sustained, and they can be \nrelied upon. That is good for our country.\n  Most importantly to me, the legislative filibuster is the one thing \nthat encourages us to work in a bipartisan way. The successful passage \nof the bipartisan infrastructure law last year is a good example. I was \nin the middle of those negotiations. We knew we had to achieve 60 votes \nin a 50-50 Senate. What did that mean? That meant that we had to find \ncommon ground. We had to make concessions on both sides in order to get \nto 60 votes. As a result, we got well over 60--into the seventies--and \na good piece of legislation was able to pass the House and be signed \ninto law and is now in place, again, as sustainable, reliable \nlegislation.\n  Did I agree with everything in it? No, nor did anybody else. But to \nget to those 60 votes, we all had to make certain concessions.\n  Although it is a Senate rule, the legislative filibuster also \nrequires Members of the House of Representatives to come up with more \nbipartisan solutions because they know their legislation has to pass \nthe Senate if they want it to become law. Just as I have been a \ncommitted, bipartisan legislator here in the Senate for the past 11 \nyears, the same was true in the House\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nfor 12 years, where I regularly used the fact that we needed 60 votes \nin the Senate to force colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether and find a way to pass legislation in a bipartisan manner. \nWhen I was in the executive branch in two Cabinet-level jobs in the \nBush 43 administration and as Director of the Office of Legislative \nAffairs for Bush 41, that 60-vote necessity in the Senate calmed the \npassions within the administration and forced us to find common ground \nto work in a more bipartisan manner, resulting in more effective \nresults that last the test of time. I know the benefits to our country \nof requiring more than a bare Senate majority that shifts back and \nforth because I have lived it in the House, in the Senate, and in the \nWhite House.\n\n  And it is not just me or other Republicans now saying that the \nlegislative filibuster is good for our Federal system. Less than 5 \nyears ago, 32 Senate Democrats, including then-Senator and now-Vice \nPresident Kamala Harris, joined with me and other Republicans in \nsigning an open letter insisting the legislative filibuster should not \nchange. This was at a time when there was a Democrat in the White \nHouse, but Republicans controlled the Senate. It appears that those 32 \nDemocrats were happy to defend the filibuster as good for the country \nwhen they were in the minority but not now when the country is even \nfurther divided, and they have a majority. All but a couple of those \nMembers have shifted their views.\n  I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to reread their own \nletter, which makes such a compelling case that this is about the \ncountry, not about one political party or another.\n  Back in 2005, Senator Schumer called abolishing the filibuster ``a \ntemper tantrum by those on the hard, hard right'' who ``want . . . \ntheir way every single time.'' That was in 2005. Now he is majority \nleader, and he has changed his tune.\n  This seems shortsighted to me, since the history of the Senate is to \nchange the majority regularly. We don't know who is going to be in the \nmajority in the next Senate.\n  Could the Senate rules be improved to allow more debate and more \nprogress on legislation? Absolutely. There is bipartisan interest in \nthis, and we should turn it to something constructive. After this \npolitical exercise we are going through right now, we should turn to \nthe issue of reforming the rules around here. Let's have each leader \nchoose a few interested Members. Let's hammer out a bipartisan proposal \nthat allows more amendments and makes it easier to get legislation \npassed. It is not that hard. But eliminating the one tool that forces \nus to come together makes it harder to address those many challenges we \nface. It makes it harder to pass legislation, broadly supported and \nsustainable, to actually help the people we represent. That is what we \nwere elected to do. That is our job--not inflame the passions of our \nmost committed and hard-line supporters but achieve results. And as I \nsaid at the outset, between inflation, and COVID, our southern border, \nand more, we have got plenty to do.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to step back from the brink, to think \ntwice before trying to destroy what has made the U.S. Senate such a \nunique and valuable part of the world's longest lasting and most \nsuccessful democracy. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support sensible rules changes and recommit to use the 60-vote \nmargin responsibly to generate consensus and find that elusive common \nground that will best serve those we represent and that will keep our \ngreat Republic the envy of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I have just come back from a trip to \nUkraine with six of my colleagues, a bipartisan group organized very \nably by Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen, to express our solidarity \nwith the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom and democracy \nagainst Russian aggression.\n  They need us to stand with them as they stand strong for their \ncountry's independence against Vladimir Putin's effort to intimidate \nthem, potentially to invade their country, but, assuredly, in a hybrid \nwar consisting of misinformation, cyber attack, and military action \nthat is designed very simply to destabilize, demoralize, and degrade \ntheir country's governance.\n  And as we stood with them, meeting with the President, Mr. Zelensky, \nand the top leadership, I couldn't help but think of this country and \nhow grateful we should be for our strength, our freedom, our democracy.\n  All of us, when we return from travel abroad, I think, express our \ngratitude to be Americans, to live in a country where these freedoms \nand our independence are assured but where we, too, need to be strong \nand ever vigilant and vigorous in protecting those freedoms.\n  We are the greatest Nation in the history of the world, the strongest \nand most freedom-loving on the planet. We are still an imperfect \nnation, still struggling to do better and a work in progress, but we \nare proud to confront our imperfection and move forward in a way that \ndemonstrates that we can broaden access to opportunity and to the right \nof people to determine their own destiny.\n  No freedom or right is more important than the right to vote. That is \nwhy we are here today and why I am so proud to have helped to lead the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and to support the Freedom to \nVote Act, which are designed to safeguard Americans' right to vote and \nsecure the sanctity of our elections.\n  And, today, just as Ukraine faces a threat to its independence and \nfreedom, we too, in America, face a threat, not from Vladimir Putin \ndirectly, although he has sought to destabilize and degrade our \ndemocracy and continues to do so through cyber attacks and \nmisinformation. Certainly, 2016's interference in our elections is a \nwarning bell, an alarm, that we need to be stronger against foreign \ninterference.\n  But within, the threat is equally, if not more, alarming because what \nwe are seeing across this great country in State after State are \nefforts to suppress the vote and restrict the franchise. Last year, \nmore than 440 restriction bills were introduced in 49 States, and 19 of \nthose States successfully enacted 34 laws that made it harder for \npeople to vote. These laws make mail-in voting and early voting more \ndifficult. They manipulate the boundaries of districts to reduce \nminority representation and have led to a purge of 3.1 million voters \nfrom the rolls in areas that were once covered by the Voting Rights Act \npreclearance requirement. We are seeing a tidal wave of voter \nsuppression that continues even as we speak today on this floor.\n  The vote today comes in a week where we celebrate the legacy of \nReverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. For the first time in my memory, I \nwas out of the country on that day. But it was ever present in my mind \nand heart, and it should animate us today, that memory and legacy which \nwere so powerfully expressed on August 6, 1965, when President Lyndon \nJohnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. He called it ``a triumph \nfor freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any \nbattlefield''--a triumph for freedom.\n  And it followed a mere 7 months after Dr. King launched a Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference campaign based in Selma, AL, with the \naim of supporting voting rights legislation. It was a great day for \nAmerica. It is one that has, rightly, received a paramount place in our \nhistory. It is taught to our children.\n  The Voting Rights Act represents the best of America, and its \ncommitment to guaranteeing that members of every racial group would \nhave equal voting opportunities stands as one of the best days in this \ncountry. But it was no layup for the civil rights movement. It\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nculminated a hard-fought campaign, and it was a hard-won victory of \ncivil rights leaders like Dr. King and John Lewis, who committed \nthemselves--literally, committed their bodies, their physical well-\nbeing--to advance the rights of others in the face of violent \nopposition. They were beaten, sometimes near death.\n  And, for decades, the Voting Rights Act remained a crucial bulwark. \nIt was retained and defended against insidious efforts to roll back the \nclock until--until--the U.S. Supreme Court did that work for opponents. \nIn 2013, in Shelby County, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the highly \neffective preclearance regime, thereby jeopardizing the progress that \nthe Voting Rights Act made over the course of half a century in \nprotecting against those voter suppression efforts throughout the \ncountry.\n\n  Justice Ginsburg said it best in her powerful dissent in Shelby \nCounty when she wrote that Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act \npreclearance requirement ``to cope with this vile infection'' of racial \ndiscrimination which ``resembled battling the Hydra. Whenever one form \nof voting discrimination was identified and prohibited, others sprang \nup in its place.''\n  And the time to protect those voting rights is before they are \nrestricted, and that is why preclearance was so important and why the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act now must be enacted into law.\n  We come here after a year that has seen the most destructive \nlegislative session for voting rights in generations, with States and \nlocalities returning to the ``conniving methods,'' as Dr. King called \nthem--``conniving methods'' of voter suppression that block people from \ngetting to the polls and making their votes count--and undermines our \ndemocracy because, as the Founders sought to do, representative \ngovernment means representing the people who are affected by these \npolicies enacted by the Federal Government. And that means \nrepresentation that enables every person to vote and to have that vote \ncount.\n  There are no guarantees that rights will be protected in this \ncountry. The fight for voting equality has faced continuous, often \nviolent resistance and enormous opposition, including from within this \nCongress, and now by a rule, a filibuster that will prevent the \nmajority from protecting those rights.\n  The effort to change the filibuster is very simply an effort to \nconvert it from a secret to a public debate mechanism--secret to \npublic. We will vote tomorrow on a rules change that provides for a \nmeans to make majority rule count--not to abolish the filibuster but to \nmake it public instead of secret.\n  As my distinguished colleague Senator Warnock posed the question in \nthis Chamber last month, we want it to be bipartisan but, as he said, \n``bipartisanship at whose expense?'' And as he also said, clearly in \nthis country, ``some people don't want some people to vote.'' And the \nfilibuster is a handy means of preventing reforms that secure the right \nto vote.\n  Historic denials of individual basic liberties and political freedoms \nhave long garnered bipartisan support and have required courage and \nconviction to overcome, and that is why we must change the rules \ntomorrow.\n  Dr. King never quit. He never stopped fighting. As he said--I think I \nam quoting him correctly--disappointment is finite, but hope is \ninfinite. And so, even if we are defeated tomorrow, we will continue \nthis effort to eliminate dark money, to provide for disclosure, to stop \nState legislatures from eliminating districts in a way that knocks \nRepresentatives out of their seats and results in gerrymandering that \nis antidemocratic.\n  For decades, Members of this Chamber have deployed the filibuster to \ndelay and block legislation that would have promoted voting rights by \nending poll taxes and literacy tests, safeguarded against workplace \ndiscrimination, and advanced civil rights in this country. The \nfilibuster has been used to block those kinds of efforts to promote \nvoting rights.\n  The longest filibusters in this Chamber's history were deployed to \nstop the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and 1964, a testament to this tool's \nhistory as a weapon against the advancement of civil rights. And Dr. \nKing himself lamented that ``tragedy [of] . . . a Senate that has a \nminority of misguided Senators who will use this filibuster to keep the \nmajority of people from even voting.''\n  We cannot continue to allow these kinds of procedural tactics to \nstand in the way of defending against a new era of hostility toward \nvoting rights of people in this country. We must protect the right to \nvote. It should not be a partisan issue.\n  In fact, voting rights are widely supported throughout American \nsociety. Those civil rights measures were supported by bipartisan \nmajorities in those years of 1957 and 1964 and in the renewal since \nthen. Photographs showing Members of both parties at bill signing \nattest powerfully to the bipartisan support this cause has enjoyed \nthroughout its history.\n  Since the original inception of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, \noverwhelming, bipartisan majorities of both Houses of Congress have \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act five times.\n  For nearly a century after the Civil War and before the Voting Rights \nAct, the scourge of racial discrimination in voting challenged our \nNation's core commitment, our basic value as a country.\n  From that century of sacrificing and suffering, so embodied by Dr. \nKing, came the Voting Rights Act and its extraordinary commitment to \nrealizing our Nation's highest ideals, the best in America. For \ndecades, it worked. In one decision and its progeny, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt undercut and undermined those rights, and now we face this \ntsunami of voter suppression bills crashing against America.\n  We must defend America. We must secure those rights and liberties, \njust as we come to the aid of countries like Ukraine that resist attack \non their independence. We must renew our Nation's commitment to \nprotecting voting rights in this country. And tomorrow, we will do it. \nTomorrow, we will vote. Members will be held accountable. We will be on \nrecord. And I hope my colleagues will do the right thing for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the voting \nlegislation that we are debating on the floor. Like so many of my \nDemocratic colleagues, I rise along with those Democratic colleagues in \ncalling for comprehensive Federal legislation to turn back the \navalanche of voter suppression legislation in various States, all of \nit--all of it--animated by the Big Lie about the 2020 election. We will \ntalk more about that in a moment.\n  It is clear to me that Republican politicians across the Nation in \nState capitals and even here in Washington are attempting to make it \nharder for tens of millions of Americans to register to vote, to cast \ntheir vote, and they are even making it harder, of course, for every \nvote to count.\n  This is a subversive threat. It is a subversive threat to our \ndemocratic institutions. I believe it is a clear and present danger to \nour elections and also a clear and present danger to our stability as a \nnation, and, of course, it is a clear and present danger and a direct \nthreat to our democracy itself.\n  Just by way of a significant example, consider what happened in just \none State in the last couple of years, in Pennsylvania. I will start \nwith a historical backdrop.\n  Pennsylvania, like a lot of States, had a high-water mark of voting \nin 1960 in the election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, \nand then in 1964, the numbers were very high as well. So in 1960, about \nright at--almost exactly 70 percent of the voting-age population voted, \nbut after 1960 and 1964, you had a precipitous drop that occurred every \n4 years. Some years, it would go up a little higher; other years, it \nwould go back down. But we never got, in 60 years, to that level again.\n  For example, just the most recent two elections before 2020 in \nPennsylvania--in the 2012 election, 5.74 million\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\npeople voted. That was 57 percent of the voting-age population, so down \nfrom that high-water mark of 70 percent in 1960. Twenty-sixteen was a \nbig turnout in our State.\n  The year 2016 was a big turnout in our State. We had more voters than \n2012. It was 6.1 million voters, and it went from 57 in 2012 to 61, so \nit got over that 60 mark, but, of course, 61 is not 70--so we got \nnowhere near, even in 2016, when you look at the percent of the voting \nage population. That is the backdrop of 2016: big turnout but not the \nturnout level we saw in 1960 or 1964 or a few other years.\n  Then, in October of 2019--this is just an example of why the voting \nmeasures we are debating here are important in a positive way for \nhelping people to vote. In October 2019, Governor Tom Wolf, in \nPennsylvania, signed Act 77. This was a historic and comprehensive \nelection reform bill that sailed through the general assembly with \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Consider this: 133 Republicans voted for this bill, when you add up \nthe number who voted in the State senate for this bill who were \nRepublicans and then you add them to the number in the State house who \nwere Republicans who voted for the bill. When you look at it across the \nwhole general assembly--both parties, both houses--about 70 percent of \nthe general assembly voted for it. So there is a lot of give-and-take \nand a lot of compromise, and they voted on a strong election reform \nbill.\n  Remember, that was October of 2019, well before the onset of the \npandemic. But thank goodness we had that bill in place during the \npandemic. In addition to enhancing election security, the Pennsylvania \nlaw, so-called Act 77, established ``no excuse'' absentee voting, \nbetter known today as mail-in voting. That applied to all voters. \nFinally, we had a mechanism that people could vote by mail, especially \nin a pandemic.\n  But, of course, when they voted on the bill in 2019, no one could \nhave predicted how useful this legislation would be just a year later. \nThis law was passed before COVID, but, of course, it was in the face of \na once-in-a-century pandemic during the runup to the 2020 election, but \nit proved to be, of course, particularly important.\n  Now we get to 2020. We have had--over many, many years, many, many \nPresidential elections--nowhere near the percent of the voting-age \npopulation voting in the Presidential election compared to 1960 and \n1964.\n  What happened in 2020? In the middle of a pandemic, when everyone was \npredicting, not just in my home State of Pennsylvania but other places \nas well, that turnout is going to be low because people are worried. \nThey are worried about--and this is, of course, before vaccines. They \nare worried about contracting the virus. So they won't vote; the \nturnout is going to be low; and we will see what happens. Well, it \ndidn't happen that way.\n  In Pennsylvania, in 2020, 6.9 million people voted--6.9 million \npeople. That is an increase of roughly 800,000 votes from just 4 years \nearlier, and that was a pretty good turnout, a really good turnout in \n2016. That 6.9 million votes amounted to 71 percent of the voting-age \npopulation of Pennsylvania, which was a point higher than 1960. No \none--no one--thought that was possible. The only way it was possible \nwas because we had better voting procedures in place.\n  In other words, if you look at it not just from 2016 to 2020 but even \nfrom the most recent election before 2016--2012, the 2012 election--the \n2020 election from the 2012 was a 20-percent increase in voter turnout. \nSo there can't be any dispute that Pennsylvania's record-setting 71-\npercent turnout was made possible only through expanding opportunities \nto vote for all voters--all voters young and old and so many others in \nbetween. Mail-in voting enabled almost 3 million Pennsylvanians to \nsafely and securely cast their ballot.\n  By any measure, Pennsylvania should be celebrated as a success story \nof why these voting provisions help people vote. I hope that we never \nfall below that 71 percent of the voting-age population. That ought to \nbe the standard for voting in a pandemic or not. In fact, that number \nshould go higher when we are outside of the pandemic because people \nhave different ways to vote.\n  A Republican-controlled legislature and a Democratic Governor came \ntogether and enacted strongly supported bipartisan election reform \nlegislation to increase election security and ballot access.\n  Unfortunately, we know that the story doesn't end there. We all know \nwhat happened in the next chapter, and it is not unique to \nPennsylvania. In response to the 2020 election, we have seen a new \nchapter, one focused on election subversion and voter suppression \nwritten in statehouses across the country. Again, it is attributable to \nthe Big Lie about the 2020 election.\n  I want to note for the record that when we voted here on January 6, \nthe evening of January 6, 2020--after the violent insurrection in the \nCapitol where we had people marching through this building, calling for \nthe death of the Vice President, trying to locate Members of Congress \nto bring them harm, and also the whole effort was directed at stopping \nthe counting of the electoral votes--but I want to note for the record \nthat a number of Republican Senators, in fact, most Republican \nSenators, stood up on January 6 that evening to vote to certify the \nelection.\n  Unfortunately, since January 6 of 2020, despite having voted the \nright way for democracy that night, a lot of these Republican Senators \nsince then have only validated the Big Lie. They may have voted the \nright way that night for our democracy, but since that time, they \nhaven't disputed the Big Lie enough--some of them, not all of them, but \nsome of them. And, of course, now they have at least turned a blind eye \nto efforts at the State level that I just spoke of.\n  I think it is also important for the record to note--I won't read all \nof this--but to note what the Associated Press found about the election \nof 2020. Here is a copy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis Associated Press story titled: ``Far too little vote fraud to tip \nelection to Trump, AP finds,'' dated December 14, 2021, by Christina A. \nCassidy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Associated Press, December 14, 2021]\n\n      Far Too Little Vote Fraud To Tip Election to Trump, AP Finds\n\n                       (By Christina A. Cassidy)\n\n       Atlanta (AP).--An Associated Press review of every \n     potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states \n     disputed by former President Donald Trump has found fewer \n     than 475--a number that would have made no difference in the \n     2020 presidential election.\n       Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, \n     Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and their 79 Electoral College \n     votes by a combined 311,257 votes out of 25.5 million ballots \n     cast for president. The disputed ballots represent just 0.15% \n     of his victory margin in those states.\n       The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if \n     all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden, which \n     they were not, and even if those ballots were actually \n     counted, which in most cases they were not.\n       The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the \n     voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual \n     acting alone to cast additional ballots.\n       The findings build on a mountain of other evidence that the \n     election wasn't rigged, including verification of the results \n     by Republican governors.\n       The AP review, a process that took months and encompassed \n     more than 300 local election offices, is one the most \n     comprehensive examinations of suspected voter fraud in last \n     year's presidential election. It relies on information \n     collected at the local level, where officials must reconcile \n     their ballots and account for discrepancies, and includes a \n     handful of separate cases cited by secretaries of state and \n     state attorneys general.\n       Contacted for comment, Trump repeated a litany of unfounded \n     claims of fraud he had made previously, but offered no new \n     evidence that specifically contradicted the AP's reporting. \n     He said a soon-to-come report from a source he would not \n     disclose would support his case, and insisted increased mail \n     voting alone had opened the door to cheating that involved \n     ``hundreds of thousands of votes.''\n       ``I just don't think you should make a fool out of yourself \n     by saying 400 votes,'' he said.\n       These are some of the culprits in the ``massive election \n     fraud'' Trump falsely says deprived him of a second term:\n       A Wisconsin man who mistakenly thought he could vote while \n     on parole.\n       A woman in Arizona suspected of sending in a ballot for her \n     dead mother.\n       A Pennsylvania man who went twice to the polls, voting once \n     on his own behalf and once for his son.\n       The cases were isolated. There was no widespread, \n     coordinated deceit.\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\n       The cases also underscore that suspected fraud is both \n     generally detected and exceptionally rare. ``Voter fraud is \n     virtually non-existent,'' said George Christenson, election \n     clerk for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, where five people \n     statewide have been charged with fraud out of nearly 3.3 \n     million ballots cast for president. ``I would have to venture \n     a guess that's about the same odds as getting hit by \n     lightning.''\n       Even in the state with the highest number of potential \n     fraud cases--Arizona, with 198--they comprised less than 2% \n     of the margin by which Biden won.\n       Trump has continued to insist that the election was \n     fraudulent by citing a wide range of complaints, many of them \n     involving the expansion of mail voting because of the \n     pandemic. As the Republican weighs another run for president \n     in 2024, he has waded into some GOP primary contests, \n     bestowing endorsements on those who mimic his ``Stop the \n     steal'' rhetoric and seeking to exact revenge on some who \n     have opposed his efforts to overturn the results.\n       Trump's false claims of a stolen election fueled the deadly \n     Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at the Capitol, have led to \n     death threats against election officials and have become \n     deeply ingrained within the GOP, with two-thirds of \n     Republicans believing Biden's election is illegitimate. \n     Republican lawmakers in several states have used the false \n     claims as justification to conduct costly and time-consuming \n     partisan election reviews, done at Trump's urging, and add \n     new restrictions for voting.\n       The number of cases identified so far by local elections \n     officials and forwarded to prosecutors, local law enforcement \n     or secretaries of state for further review undercuts Trump's \n     claim. Election officials also say that in most cases, the \n     additional ballots were never counted because workers did \n     their jobs and pulled them for inspection before they were \n     added to the tally.\n       ``There is a very specific reason why we don't see many \n     instances of fraud, and that is because the system is \n     designed to catch it, to flag it and then hold those people \n     accountable,'' said Amber McReynolds, a former director of \n     elections in Denver and the founding CEO of the National Vote \n     at Home Institute, which promotes mail voting.\n       The AP's review of cases in the six battleground states \n     found no evidence to support Trump's various claims, which \n     have included unsupported allegations that more votes were \n     tallied than there are registered voters and that thousands \n     of mail-in ballots were cast by people who are not on voter \n     rolls. Dozens of state and federal courts have rejected the \n     claims.\n       White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the AP's reporting \n     offered further proof that the election was fairly conducted \n     and decided, contrary to Trump's claims.\n       ``Each time this dangerous but weak and fear-ridden \n     conspiracy theory has been put forward, it has only cemented \n     the truth more by being completely debunked--including at the \n     hands of elections authorities from both parties across the \n     nation, nonpartisan experts, and over 80 federal judges,'' he \n     said.\n       Experts say to pull off stealing a presidential election \n     would require large numbers of people willing to risk \n     prosecution, prison time and fines working in concert with \n     election officials from both parties who are willing to look \n     the other way. And everyone somehow would keep quiet about \n     the whole affair.\n       ``It would be the most extensive conspiracy in the history \n     of planet Earth,'' said David Becker, a senior trial attorney \n     in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division during the \n     presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who now \n     directs the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & \n     Research.\n       Separate from the fraud allegations are claims by Trump and \n     his allies that voting systems or ballot tallies were somehow \n     manipulated to steal the election. Judges across the country, \n     of both parties, dismissed those claims. That includes a \n     federal judge in Michigan who ordered sanctions against \n     attorneys allied with Trump for intending to create \n     ``confusion, commotion and chaos'' in filing a lawsuit about \n     the vote-counting process without checking for evidence to \n     support the claims.\n       Even Trump's former attorney general, William Barr, said a \n     month after the election that there was no indication of \n     widespread fraud that could change the result.\n       For its review, AP reporters in five states contacted \n     roughly 340 election offices for details about every instance \n     of potential voter fraud that was identified as part of their \n     post-election review and certification process.\n       After an election is over, officials research voter \n     records, request and review additional information if needed \n     from the state or other counties, and eventually decide \n     whether to refer potential fraud cases for further \n     investigation--a process that can take months.\n       For Wisconsin, the AP relied on a report about fraud \n     investigations compiled by the state and filed public records \n     requests to get the details of each case, in addition to \n     prosecutions that were not initially reported to the state \n     elections commission. Wisconsin is the only one of the six \n     states with a centralized accounting of all potential voter \n     fraud cases.\n       A state-by-state accounting:\n       --ARIZONA: Authorities have been investigating 198 possible \n     fraud cases out of nearly 3.4 million votes cast, \n     representing 1.9% of Biden's margin of victory in the state. \n     Virtually all the cases were in Pima County, home to Tucson, \n     and involved allegations of double voting. The county has a \n     practice of referring every effort to cast a second ballot to \n     prosecutors, something other offices don't do. In the Pima \n     cases, only one ballot for each voter was counted. So far, \n     nine people have been charged in the state with voting fraud \n     crimes following the 2020 election. Six of those were filed \n     by the state attorney general's office, which has an election \n     integrity unit that is reviewing an undisclosed number of \n     additional cases.\n       --GEORGIA: Election officials in 124 of the state's 159 \n     counties reported no suspicious activity after conducting \n     their post-election checks. Officials in 24 counties \n     identified 64 potential voter fraud cases, representing 0.54% \n     of Biden's margin of victory in Georgia. Of those, 31 were \n     determined to be the result of an administrative error or \n     some other mistake. Eleven counties, most of them rural, \n     either declined to say or did not respond. The state attorney \n     general's office is reviewing about 20 cases referred so far \n     by the state election board related to all elections in 2020, \n     including the primary, but it was not known if any of those \n     overlapped with cases already identified by local election \n     officials.\n       --MICHIGAN: Officials have identified 56 potential \n     instances of voter fraud in five counties, representing 0.04% \n     of Biden's margin of victory in the state. Most of the cases \n     involved two people suspected of submitting about 50 \n     fraudulent requests for absentee ballots in Macomb, Wayne and \n     Oakland counties. All the suspicious applications were \n     flagged by election officials and no ballots were cast \n     improperly.\n       --NEVADA: Local officials identified between 93 and 98 \n     potential fraud cases out of 1.4 million ballots cast, \n     representing less than one-third of 1% of Biden's margin of \n     victory. More than half the total--58--were in Washoe County, \n     which includes Reno, and the vast majority involved \n     allegations of possible double voting. The statewide total \n     does not include thousands of fraud allegations submitted to \n     the state by local Republicans. Republican Secretary of State \n     Barbara Cegavske has said many of those were based ``largely \n     upon an incomplete assessment of voter registration records \n     and lack of information concerning the processes by which \n     these records are compiled and maintained.'' It's not known \n     how many remain under investigation.\n       --PENNSYLVANIA: Election officials in 11 of the state's 67 \n     counties identified 26 possible cases of voter fraud, \n     representing 0.03% of Biden's margin of victory. The \n     elections office in Philadelphia refused to discuss potential \n     cases with the AP, but the prosecutor's office in \n     Philadelphia said it has not received any fraud-related \n     referrals.\n       --WISCONSIN: Election officials have referred 31 cases of \n     potential fraud to prosecutors in 12 of the state's 72 \n     counties, representing about 0.15% of Biden's margin of \n     victory. After reviewing them, prosecutors declined to bring \n     charges in 26 of those cases. Meagan Wolfe, administrator of \n     the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the number of cases \n     in 2020 was ``fairly run of the mill.''\n       AP's review found the potential cases of fraud ran the \n     gamut: Some were attributed to administrative error or voter \n     confusion while others were being examined as intentional \n     attempts to commit fraud. In those cases, many involved \n     people who sought to vote twice--by casting both an absentee \n     and an in-person ballots--or those who cast a ballot for a \n     dead relative such as the woman in Maricopa County, Arizona. \n     Authorities there say she signed her mother's name on a \n     ballot envelope. The woman's mother had died a month before \n     the election.\n       The cases are bipartisan. Some of those charged with fraud \n     are registered Republicans or told investigators they were \n     supporters of Trump.\n       Donald Holz is among the five people in Wisconsin who face \n     voter fraud charges. He said all he wanted to do was vote for \n     Trump. But because he was still on parole after being \n     convicted of felony drunken driving, the 63-year-old retiree \n     was not eligible to do so. Wisconsin is not among the states \n     that have loosened felon voting laws in recent years.\n       Holz said he had no intention to break the law and only did \n     so after he asked poll workers if it was OK.\n       ``The only thing that helps me out is that I know what I \n     did and I did it with good intentions,'' Holz said after an \n     initial court appearance in Fond du Lac. ``The guy upstairs \n     knows what I did. I didn't have any intention to commit \n     election fraud.''\n       In southeast Pennsylvania, 72-year-old Ralph Thurman, a \n     registered Republican, was sentenced to three years' \n     probation after pleading guilty to one count of repeat \n     voting. Authorities said Thurman, after voting at his polling \n     place, returned about an hour later wearing sunglasses and \n     cast a ballot in his son's name.\n       After being recognized and confronted, Thurman fled the \n     building, officials said. Thurman's attorney told the AP the \n     incident was the result of miscommunication at the polling \n     place. Las Vegas businessman Donald ``Kirk'' Hartle was among \n     those in Nevada who raised the cry against election fraud. \n     Early on, Hartle insisted someone had unlawfully cast a \n     ballot in the name of his dead wife, and state Republicans \n     seized on his story to support their claims of widespread \n     fraud in the state. It turned out that someone had cast the \n     ballot illegally--Hartle,\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\n     himself. He agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of \n     voting more than once in the same election. Hartle's attorney \n     said the businessman, who is an executive at a company that \n     hosted a Trump rally before the election, had accepted \n     responsibility for his actions.\n       Additional fraud cases could still surface in the weeks and \n     months ahead. One avenue for those is the Electronic \n     Registration Information Center, a data-sharing effort among \n     31 states aimed at improving state voter rolls. The effort \n     also provides states with reports after each general election \n     with information about voters who might have cast ballots in \n     more than one state.\n       In the past, those lists have generated small numbers of \n     fraud cases. In 2018, for example, Wisconsin used the report \n     to identify 43 additional instances of potential fraud out of \n     2.6 million ballots cast.\n       Official post-election audits and other research have shown \n     voter fraud to be exceptionally rare. A nonpartisan audit of \n     Wisconsin's 2020 presidential election found no evidence of \n     widespread fraud and a Republican lawmaker concluded it \n     showed that elections in the state were ``safe and secure,'' \n     while also recommending dozens of changes to how elections \n     are run. In Michigan, Republican state senators issued a \n     report earlier this year saying they had found ``no evidence \n     of widespread or systematic fraud'' in the 2020 election.\n       Not only do election officials look for fraud, they have \n     procedures to detect and prevent it. For mail voting, which \n     expanded greatly last year because of the pandemic, election \n     officials log every mail ballot so voters cannot request more \n     than one. Those ballots also are logged when they are \n     returned, checked against registration and, in many cases, \n     voter signatures on file to ensure the voter assigned to the \n     ballot is the one who cast it. If everything doesn't match, \n     the ballot isn't counted.\n       ``Often, we don't get to fraud,'' said Jennifer Morrell, a \n     former local election official in Utah and Colorado who \n     advises election officials on security and other issues. \n     ``Say we have evidence that something might not be correct, \n     we ask the voter to provide additional documentation. If the \n     person doesn't respond, the ballot isn't accepted. The fraud \n     never happened.''\n       If a person who requested a mail ballot shows up at a \n     polling place, this will become apparent when they check in. \n     Typically, poll workers either cancel the ballot that was \n     previously issued, ensuring it's never counted, or ask the \n     voter to complete a provisional ballot that will only be \n     counted if the mail ballot is not.\n       In Union County, Georgia, someone voted in person and then \n     election officials found their ballot in a drop box. Since \n     the person had already voted, the ballot in the drop box was \n     not counted and the case was referred to the state for \n     investigation, Deputy Registrar Diana Nichols said.\n       ``We can tell pretty quick whenever we pull up that \n     record--wait a minute, this person has already voted,'' \n     Nichols said. ``I'm not saying it's foolproof. We are all \n     human, and we all make mistakes. But as far as the system is \n     set up, if you follow the rules and the guidelines set up by \n     the state, I think it's a very good system.''\n       The final step is the canvassing process in which election \n     officials must reconcile all their counts ensuring the number \n     of ballots cast equals the number of voters who voted. Any \n     discrepancies are researched, and election officials provide \n     detailed explanations before the election can be certified.\n       Often, an administrative error can raise questions that \n     suggest the potential for fraud. In Forsyth County, Georgia, \n     election officials were asked by Arizona investigators for \n     records confirming that a voter had also cast a ballot in \n     Georgia last November. It turns out that voter didn't cast a \n     ballot but was listed as having done so because their \n     registration number was mistakenly associated with another \n     voter's record in the county's system, according to a letter \n     sent by county election officials.\n       In other cases, it could be as simple as a voter signing on \n     the wrong line next to another person name in a paper \n     pollbook at their polling place. Once researched, it quickly \n     becomes clear no fraud occurred.\n       Republican lawmakers have argued there are security gaps in \n     the process, using concerns of fraud to justify restrictions \n     on voting laws. This has happened even in places where \n     Republican lawmakers have pushed back against Trump's false \n     claims and said the 2020 election was valid.\n       The review by Republican lawmakers in Michigan that found \n     no systemic fraud cited various claims they had investigated. \n     For example, senators were provided with a list of over 200 \n     voters in Wayne County who were believed to be dead. Of \n     these, the report noted, only two instances involved actual \n     dead voters. The first was due to a clerical error in which a \n     son had been confused with his dead father and the second \n     involved a 92-year-old woman who had died four days before \n     the election.\n       And yet, Republicans in the state are collecting signatures \n     for a citizen initiative that would allow the GOP-controlled \n     legislature to approve voting restrictions and bypass a veto \n     by the Democratic governor. Republicans say mail voting needs \n     to be more secure as more people embrace it.\n       ``These bills will restore confidence in our elections,'' \n     said GOP Rep. Ann Bollin, chairwoman of the Michigan House \n     Elections and Ethics Committee and a former township clerk. \n     ``Voters want to know their vote will count and that they, \n     and only they, are casting their own ballot.''\n       Overall, 80% of counties in the six states reviewed by the \n     AP reported no suspicious activity after completing their \n     post-election reviews. This was true of both small and large \n     counties, something experts said was to be expected given how \n     rare voter fraud has been.\n       Limited instances of fraud do occur, as the AP review \n     illustrates, but safeguards ensure they are few and that they \n     are caught, said Ben Hovland, a Democrat appointed by Trump \n     to serve on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which \n     supports the state and local officials who administer \n     elections.\n       ``Every credible examination has shown there was no \n     widespread fraud'' in the 2020 presidential election, Hovland \n     said. ``Time and again when we have heard these claims and \n     heard these allegations, and when you do a real \n     investigation, you see that it is the exception and not the \n     rule.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I will just read the first paragraph of \nthis Associated Press story dated December of this past year:\n\n       An Associated Press review of every potential case of voter \n     fraud in the six battleground states disputed by former \n     President Donald Trump has found fewer than 475--a number \n     that would have made no difference in the 2020 Presidential \n     election.\n\n  And, of course, Pennsylvania was one of those States that they looked \nat. We know what happened in the election, and we know why we can say \nwith certainty that the Big Lie is nothing but a lie. After the \nelection of 2020, in June of 2021, Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled \nlegislature became one of the many legislatures across the Nation \npassing a voter suppression law. Here is what they would have done if \nthey were successful. If they would have passed it, this bill would \nhave imposed unconstitutional voter ID restrictions, restricted mail-in \nvoting--the mail-in voting they just voted in favor of in 2019, the \nsame legislators--and this bill would essentially have eliminated the \nuse of drop boxes. Furthermore, it rolled back several successful \nprovisions of the bipartisan Act 77, including reducing the number of \ndays permitted to register to vote, and eliminating an option to opt in \nto receive an annual mail-in ballot.\n  While this bill was, fortunately, vetoed by Governor Wolf, the threat \nto suppress the vote in Pennsylvania remains ever present as the \nlegislature continues to work on another omnibus election bill.\n  Once again, the Big Lie animates the work of Republican politicians \nin Pennsylvania and throughout the country. It is not simply a lie; it \nis a lie that engenders fear. Sometimes fear of losing your election in \na primary--we understand that fear. We have seen it play out here as \nwell. But sometimes the fear is deeper than that; that your own \nsecurity will be at risk if you don't espouse the Big Lie.\n  In light of these efforts, it is fair to question, How did \nPennsylvania go from a shining example of bipartisan election reform in \n2019 to ground zero in the fight against voter suppression and election \nmisinformation in 2021 and continuing into 2022?\n  In the months leading up to the 2020 general election, the former \nPresident led an assault on our election system, sowing seeds of \ndivision, and, without evidence, questioning the legitimacy of voting \nmethods, including mail-in voting, which has been utilized in the \nNation for decades. By the way, mail-in voting allowed us to set a \nturnout record, as I said before, in Pennsylvania, for the first time \nin 60 years to go that high--of the voting-age population.\n  The former President lost his election to President Joe Biden, but \ninstead of honorably conceding the race, he created the Big Lie that \nthe election had been stolen from him by raising unfounded allegations \nof voter fraud, election irregularities in Pennsylvania and across the \nNation. Of course, there is simply no evidence to justify these claims \nof widespread voter fraud or irregularities, as suggested in the AP \nstory and in their investigation that undergirds their conclusions that \nsupport that.\n  The Big Lie is the fraud. If you want to talk about fraud, that is \nwhere it is. That is the fraud. The Big Lie is the falsehood and the \ncon job. It is a deliberate, ongoing attempt to sow instability. We \nknow that over 60 cases in court after court--from State courts to \ndistrict courts, to circuit courts, to the U.S. Supreme Court--all \nthose courts refused to indulge the unprecedented,\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\nloopy, legal arguments and false conspiracy theories that were put \nforward by the President's campaign and some Republicans after the \nelection.\n  Despite the lack of any evidence to support claims of widespread \nfraud, we continue to hear these baseless conspiracy theories in calls \nto roll back Pennsylvania's Act 77 for one reason and one reason only: \nto disenfranchise voters. So in order to please one man, rather than \nsupport positive reforms that worked in Pennsylvania, that increased \nturnout in Pennsylvania exponentially like no other law has, lawmakers \nhave introduced, all over the country now, some 400 voter suppression \nbills.\n  There are three types of corrupt proposals that I would like to \nsummarize. No. 1, shifting election authority; that is one measure of a \ncorrupt practice. No. 2, attacking election workers; that is corrupt, \nand that is what they are trying to do. And No. 3, restricting mail-in \nvoting.\n  First and foremost, many of the bills attack the most fundamental \nfoundational element of our democracy: administering our elections.\n  According to a report from Voting Rights Lab, in September of 2021, \nmore than 180 of the bills introduced across the country are an effort \nto subvert our current election administration. Some of these bills \nwould allow the legislature or other partisan actors--really, purveyors \nof the Big Lie--to exert greater control over elections and interfere \nwith local election administrators.\n  For example, Georgia's SB 202, which has already been enacted into \nlaw--not just proposed--this law will allow a partisan State election \nboard to remove and replace local election administrators. The new law \nempowers the State legislature--the State legislature--to appoint the \nchair of the election board, ensuring that the majority of the board \nreflects the partisan will of the legislature.\n  We have also seen numerous lawmakers, including in Pennsylvania, \ninitiate or attempt to initiate partisan election ``audits'' into the \n2020 election results without any evidence of fraud. The better word \nfor this type of approach is ``fraudit.'' That is what it is. It is a \nfraudulent attempt, and it is nothing more than a ``fraudit.''\n  These efforts fueled by the Big Lie have wasted millions of taxpayer \ndollars, money solely in an attempt to further call into doubt the 2020 \nelection and create instability in our elections. Republican effort to \nshift election authority undermines people's faith in elections, and it \ninjects partisanship into our election administration.\n  The second area of corruption we have also seen in some of these \nbills is efforts to pass legislation that create or increase civil and \ncriminal penalties against election workers. Election officials across \nthe Nation--Republicans and Democrats alike, from blue counties and red \ncounties--should be accorded the respect and commendation they deserve. \nThese are public servants. They should not be subjected to threats, \neither legal or otherwise. In the middle of the pandemic, these same \nAmericans risked their own health and their families' health to ensure \nthat the elections were conducted safely and efficiently. These \nAmericans--Republicans and Democrats and Independents--did their job \nhonorably. Rather than receiving appreciation for their efforts, they \nand their families have been threatened with threats of violence, \nfueled by the deliberate falsehoods of which I spoke before.\n  The same falsehoods spread by politicians here in Washington and in \nState legislatures across the country. These threats were particularly \nrelevant in my home State of Pennsylvania when then-Philadelphia \nCommissioner, Al Schmidt, a Republican, his family, and his colleagues \nwere subjected to death threats--death threats--for doing their job.\n  This is a Republican elected official in Philadelphia subjected to \ndeath threats after election day, simply because he was trying to \nfulfill--and the others who worked with him were trying to fulfill--an \nessential part of their basic duty, which is counting the votes in that \ncity.\n  So despite the widely reported threats against our election officials \nand concerns about mass resignations due to the stresses on our \ndemocratic institutions, Republican legislatures have enacted laws that \nfurther threaten these officials with felony prosecutions, and they \nalso threaten civil penalties for not complying with the election \nrules, even inadvertent or technical mistakes.\n  We have never seen this before in America, but that is what we are \ntalking about today. So these attacks are a clear attempt to further \nundermine our democracy and counter the efforts of many election \nofficials to help make voting safer and easier during the COVID-19 \npandemic.\n  Finally, the third issue, which I would consider a corrupt practice \nthat is embedded into these bills, is the question of mail-in voting. \nAs I have already shared, Pennsylvania's record turnout in 2020 was a \ndirect result of the bipartisan efforts, 133 Republican legislators \nvoting for mail-in balloting, so that we would have universal mail-in \nvoting, and early voting in addition to mail-in voting.\n  Rather than embracing its success, Republican lawmakers in \nPennsylvania and across the country have worked to greatly restrict or \neliminate--or eliminate--mail-in voting through a variety of methods. \nSeven States have reduced the timeframe in which voters can request \nmail-in ballots. Another four States limited the use of ballot drop \nboxes.\n  Some States have gutted or tried to gut the ability of voters to \nautomatically register to receive a mail-in ballot for every election \nthey are eligible to vote in.\n  Republican politicians just keep on lying about the 2020 election. \nNot a single Republican politician has come forward with evidence of \nthe type of widespread systemic voter fraud that would necessitate any \nof the changes that these laws are predicated on and these proposals \nare predicated on.\n  In reality, these changes are about one thing and one thing only--\nmaking it more difficult to cast a ballot.\n  Every single American should be alarmed by these efforts. If we allow \nvoter suppression efforts to go unchecked, they will, eventually and \nsimply, impact everyone.\n  I think it was Martin Luther King who talked about injustice--an \ninjustice that would be validated by these corrupt proposals. \n``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n  Voter suppression efforts would make it harder. Here are just a \ncouple of examples from my home State, and this is true of a lot of \nStates. Voter suppression laws make it harder for a 90-year-old living \nin rural Pennsylvania who can't get to her county election bureau to \nvote or to a polling place. She will have a harder time voting in \nPennsylvania and in every other State, if Pennsylvania goes in the \ndirection of some of these other States.\n  Pennsylvania has over 800,000 veterans who fought for our freedoms, \nincluding the right to vote, the freedom to vote. Shouldn't that \nveteran continue to have the option to vote early or to vote by \nmail? After they have served our Nation, shouldn't they continue to \nhave that option? Or should we just go back to the old ways where that \nveteran is limited to one day a year, for a certain number of hours a \nyear, to vote in a general election?\n\n  So these proposals--these voter suppression and subversion \nproposals--will impact everyone. It will impact a farmer in \nPennsylvania who might have a very busy day on election day and can't \nget to vote for one reason or another.\n  So, if they are not able to vote, their vote gets cancelled out \nbecause we decided not to have early voting, which we have now; we \ndecided not to have mail-in ballots, which we have now? All in the \nservice of one man and one Big Lie, that is what this is all about.\n  So we can't go back to those days.\n  How about just another example from Pennsylvania? We have had a long \ntradition where men and women serving overseas have voted by absentee \nballot. Guess what an absentee ballot is? An absentee ballot is a mail-\nin ballot. It is the same thing. We just broadened the category of \nfolks who could use that same method.\n  So do we want to go back to a time when we can't have the kind of \nmail-in ballots that we had in 2020 that led to that great turnout? And \nit is entirely possible that we could go back to a time when even the \nvotes of men and women serving overseas would be put at risk, because \nwhen you eliminate\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nmail-in ballots in a State like Pennsylvania, you are eliminating \nabsentee ballots, as well, by doing that.\n  So I don't think we want to do that to our fighting men and women. So \nwe can't go back to the days when farmers and small business owners and \nveterans and busy moms juggling their kids' schedules and seniors who \nmay have trouble voting and need another option to vote--we can't go \nback to those days when they couldn't vote if they didn't have the time \non that one single day.\n  It is one of the reasons why we had such low voter turnout, even in \nPresidential elections, for all these years in Pennsylvania and in so \nmany other States. So we know what we have to do. We have to go back to \nour founding principles. And voting is a foundational pillar of our \ndemocracy. And, as elected officials, it is our responsibility to do \nall we can to expand voter access and remove institutional barriers to \nvoting.\n  But we have got to be clearer about what is happening. Our democracy, \nby virtue of these suppression bills, is under siege right now. The \nattack here on January 6 continues. What was a violent attack on that \nday is now in the form of legislation to attack our elections, to \nattack the right to vote, to make it harder to vote.\n  So attacking democracy at an earlier stage was always met by the \nright response. Today, that right response--the correct response--is to \npass the Freedom to Vote and the John Lewis Act to prevent these kinds \nof attacks on voting rights.\n  It would protect election officials by criminalizing intimidation, \nthreats, or coercion of election officials. It would mandate \nsystematic, nonpartisan, risk-limiting audits to combat against the \nunfounded partisan approaches by Republicans.\n  It would create national standards for early voting, mail voting, \nvoting restoration, voter identification, and voter registration. It \nwould also include some of the provisions of my bill--the Accessible \nVoting Act--to create an accessible voting experience for every voter, \nensuring that the needs of people with disabilities are met.\n  That is another category of Americans whose votes will be \nsuppressed--people with disabilities--if these Republicans get their \nway.\n  This bill we are trying to pass reflects feedback from State and \nlocal officials to ensure that people responsible for implementing \nthese reforms can do so effectively.\n  And, furthermore, it would restore the full strength of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 after the Supreme Court gutted several of the Voting \nRights Act provisions in recent years.\n  These provisions work hand in hand to improve access to the ballot \nand protect against election subversion. We should restore the Senate \nat the same time, by allowing plenty of time for debate, as well as a \nrobust amendment process, so the minority party in the Senate has full \nopportunity to debate issues like voting rights.\n  So we have got to do more than just simply move a bill forward \ntomorrow on voting rights. We should also change the Senate rules \nappropriately to allow that bill to be passed by a majority after we \nhave a robust debate. Debating voting rights has never been more \nimportant. The time to do that is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hassan). The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, I have enjoyed the discussion which has \nbeen going on with regard to this legislation and have a couple of \ncomments. One is, given the interest and the priority of and the \nimportance of elections, it would have been helpful, prior to preparing \nthis legislation for a vote, if those that were the drafters of this \nlegislation actually invited a Republican--any Republican--to sit down \nand perhaps negotiate and see if we could find some common ground.\n  But instead, the Democrat leadership dusted off what they had written \nbefore on an entirely partisan basis and then are shocked--shocked--\nthat Republicans don't want to support what they drafted.\n  Now, I note that political overstatement and hyperbole may be \nrelatively common, and they are often excused. But the President and \nsome of my Democratic colleagues have ventured deep into hysteria. \nTheir cataclysmic predictions for failing to support their entirely \npartisan election reform--worked out entirely by themselves, without \nany input whatsoever from any single person on my side of the aisle--\nthey are far beyond the pale.\n  Now, they are entirely right to call out Donald Trump's Big Lie about \nthe last election being stolen. But in the same spirit of honesty, they \nshould not engage in a similar lie that Republicans across the country \nare making it much harder for minorities to vote and, thus, that the \nFederal government must urgently displace centuries of constitutional \npractice that give States primary control over elections.\n  So dire are the consequences, they claim, that this must be done by \nshredding the rules of our senior legislative body. They point to \nGeorgia as evidence of political election villainy. The President went \nthere to deliver his crowning argument. But, as has been pointed out by \nmany before me, it is easier for minorities--and everybody else for \nthat matter--to vote in Georgia than it is in the President's home \nState of Delaware and in Leader Schumer's home State of New York.\n  In Georgia there are more days of early voting, and in Georgia there \nis no-excuse absentee voting by mail.\n  They do decry Georgia's prohibition of political activists \napproaching voters in line with drinks of water, but the same \nprohibition exists in New York. And why? So that voters don't get \nharassed in line by poll activists.\n  Just like Georgia and New York, many States keep poll activists at \nlength from voters. My Democrat colleagues conveniently ignore the fact \nthat the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibition of any voting practice or \nprocedure that discriminates against minorities is still in effect. \nEven today, the Justice Department is suing two States under that law.\n  Protection of minority voting is already required by law. Protection \nof minority voting is a high and essential priority for me and for my \nSenate colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  To be clear, I want an election system that allows every eligible \ncitizen in every State to be able to exercise their right to vote in \nevery single election.\n  So, putting aside the hysteria, let me explain why I don't support \nthe Democrats' bill. First, their bill weakens voter ID. I, along with \na great majority of voters of all races, favor voter photo ID. Their \nbill makes it easier to cheat by accommodating unmonitored vote \ncollection boxes. Their bill opens the gates to a flood of lawsuits \npre- and post-election, and it weakens the safeguards of voter \nregistration.\n  There are other things in the Democrats' bill that I don't support. I \nam not in favor of Federal funding for campaigns. I also don't think \nStates should be required to allow felons to vote.\n  Most fundamentally, I think by reserving election procedures to the \nStates, the Founders made it more difficult for a would-be \nauthoritarian to change the law for voting in just one place--here in \nWashington--to keep himself in office.\n  Let me add that I think the Democrats' bill is insufficiently focused \non the real threat, and that is the corruption of the counting of the \nballots, the certification of elections, and the congressional \nprovisions for accepting and counting a slate of electors. This is \nwhere the apparent conspirators were focused in their attempt in the \nlast election to subvert democracy and prevent the peaceful transfer of \npower.\n  Now, I respect Democrats who disagree with my point of view. I hope \nthey will offer me the same respect. People who want voter ID are not \nracists. People who don't want Federal funding of campaigns aren't Bull \nConnor. People who insist that vote drop boxes be monitored aren't \nJefferson Davis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just yesterday, we, the Nation, \ncelebrated the moral vision and exceptional courage of the Reverend Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  Born and raised under the violent oppression of Jim Crow segregation, \nDr.\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\nKing deeply felt the lasting wounds of slavery and segregation. Yet he \nbelieved in the promise of America's highest ideal: a system of \ndemocracy that we are all created equal; democracy that recognizes that \nwe are all created equal.\n  In 1957, Dr. King told a crowd of civil rights leaders:\n\n       Our most urgent plea to the federal government is to \n     guarantee our voting rights.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Give us the ballot and we will creatively join in the \n     freeing of the soul of America.\n\n  Time and again, from a bridge in Selma to the steps of the Lincoln \nMemorial, Dr. King and the civil rights movement collectively forced \nthis country to confront the brutal injustice of White supremacy.\n  Dr. King kindled a movement of peaceful protests, of voter \nregistration, and a legal revolution. His leadership helped secure the \npassage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965--a monument to freedom and a \nguardian of our multiracial democracy.\n  As important a step as that was, Dr. King also understood that the \npath of progress, the road to freedom, would not be linear, it would \nnot be direct, and it would be threatened by setbacks. Recent years \nhave illustrated just how right Dr. King was. The clock is turning back \non voting rights, and far too many people both inside this Capitol and \noutside it are ignoring or denying the alarm bells.\n  To truly honor Dr. King, we must rededicate ourselves to the cause of \nfreedom and equality. We cannot wait for a convenient season to act. We \ncannot wait for another Bloody Sunday. Look around. This is our moment. \nThe threats to democracy today may look different than Bull Connor with \nthe bullhorn, but they are no less real.\n  Now, when Republicans claim that this is all hyperbole or hysteria, \nas Senator Romney just referenced, consider this: In the year since our \nNation's most secure election ever, with record voter turnout, \nRepublican State legislatures have passed 34 laws, not expanding access \nto the ballot, restricting access to the ballot and also threatening \nelection security.\n  Just look at Georgia--yes, Georgia--where Republicans passed an \nelections bill, SB 202, on a purely partisan basis this last spring. In \nthe 2020 election, Georgians voted in record numbers. Many voted by \nmail or used early voting options to be able to cast their ballots \nsafely and securely in the midst of this once-in-a-century global \nhealth pandemic. Guess what happened. Those ballots were processed, \ncounted, audited, and the results certified.\n  So how did Georgia Republicans respond? They wrote SB 202 to cut the \nnumber of early voting drop boxes in Atlanta by more than 75 percent to \nmake it harder--not easier but harder--for voters who mistakenly go to \nthe wrong polling place to cast their ballots and have their votes in \nstatewide contests counted; to stop new voters from being able to \nregister to vote in a runoff election if there is one. Now, make no \nmistake, Republicans will deny the intention, but the effect is clear: \nThese changes disproportionately disenfranchise the votes and the \nvoices of people of color.\n\n  When voters end up standing in line for hours to cast their vote on \nelection day, as voters of color disproportionately do, SB 202 prevents \nvolunteers from offering them food or water.\n  Now, Senator Romney said that these provisions are in place to \nprevent the harassment of voters waiting to vote. Look at what other \nStates have done. There is a clear distinction between somebody \nharassing a voter, interfering with the electoral process, versus \noffering a thirsty neighbor a drink. So outlaw harassment. I think it \nkind of is. The general public knows the distinction. So think about \nthat--someone standing in line outdoors, with weather, for hours to do \ntheir patriotic duty, and Georgia Republicans make it a crime to give \nthat person a bottle of water.\n  SB 202 isn't about election security or voter fraud. The data on that \nis clear. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare in Georgia and across the \ncountry. SB 202 is about erecting barriers for low-income voters, for \nvoters of color, for younger voters to participate in our democracy.\n  As a member of the Senate Rules Committee, I traveled to Georgia last \nsummer with my colleagues for a field hearing on voter suppression. \nJust last week, I was invited to join President Biden and Vice \nPresident Harris in Georgia as well. So when Minority Leader McConnell \ntries to tell you that no State in America is making it harder to vote, \nhe is wrong. The people of this country deserve to hear the truth, and \nnot just from Georgia but in Texas, where a new law empowers partisan \npoll watchers to threaten election officials with lawsuits; in Arizona, \nwhere a new law will unnecessarily cut tens of thousands of voters--\neligible voters--from the permanent early voting list.\n  Thirty-four new laws in this past year alone will raise obstacles for \npeople who simply want to cast their ballot, and that is nothing to say \nof the hundreds more that have been proposed that will surely be \nreintroduced in future years and future sessions if we do not act.\n  The clock on Dr. King's victory is already turning back. The alarm \nbells of our democracy are ringing. They have been ringing since the \nyear 2013, when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Yes, it \nmay still be in place, but the preclearance requirement--the strongest \nprotection within the Voting Rights Act that stood to prevent \ndiscriminatory election laws for nearly five decades--was undone by the \nSupreme Court in their decision in Shelby v. Holder. Yet the Senate has \nfailed three times this last year to even debate a voting rights bill. \nWe failed to debate because of the filibuster rule, which allows a \nminority of Senators to obstruct the voice of the American majority.\n  Republican Senators claim that our legislation, the Freedom to Vote \nAct, is partisan and divisive, but what goal could be more American \nthan securing the fundamental right to vote for all eligible Americans?\n  If Republican Senators are sincere about opposing partisan changes to \nelection laws, then they should join us in condemning partisan voter \nsuppression in Georgia, in Texas, in Arizona, and across the country. \nInstead, Senate Republicans only complain about and obstruct our \nefforts here in the Senate to respond to these laws, and in doing so, \nthey leave Democrats no choice. We must change the filibuster rule to \nprotect voting rights for every American.\n  The Senate exists to serve American democracy, and the Senate rules \nexist to help the Senate serve American democracy. When those rules \nendanger our democracy, the answer is simple: We must change them.\n  It is not unprecedented. The Senate changed the filibuster in 1917 to \nprotect our Nation from the threat of World War I. The Senate changed \nthe filibuster in 1975 to try to restore the function of this body. In \nrecent decades, the Senate has made more than 160 exceptions to the \nfilibuster to do what is best for the Nation. Today, it is time for us \nto do so once again.\n  With all due respect to the history and the traditions of the Senate, \nour job is to protect the future of this country, beginning with our \ndemocracy. As Martin Luther King once told us, ``America is essentially \na dream, a dream . . . yet unfulfilled.''\n  Today, it falls on each of us to take up Dr. King's lifelong \nstruggle. This is our moment. This is our moment to debate. This is our \nmoment to vote. We must work together to pass a voting rights law that \nsecures the vote for every American regardless of race, religion, \nability, or gender.\n\n  Sometimes progress requires that we change the rules, as we did last \nmonth when we changed the filibuster to protect our economy. Sometimes \nprogress requires that one party act alone, as the courageous \narchitects of the 15th Amendment did a century and a half ago.\n  Look around this Senate, and think how surprised the men who created \nthe filibuster in the early 1800s would be to see a Senator Warnock, a \nSenator Baldwin, myself, and others serving in this Chamber today, but \nchange that strengthens our democracy is change for the better.\n  Colleagues, we must rise to meet this general moment of challenge in \nthe spirit of Dr. King and pass these voting rights bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, one of the things that I sometimes regret \nabout this body--and especially after hearing such an eloquent \npresentation from my colleague from California--is that we don't do \nenough dialogue here; it is a lot of monologues. Often, some of the \nbest speeches that I have heard in this Chamber have been delivered to \nnearly empty Chambers because we don't sit and listen to one another, \nanswer questions, engage, find the greater wisdom.\n  I am excited that tomorrow will give us an opportunity to do that. I \nexpect 50--hopefully, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100--Senators on the floor for a \ndiscussion about voting rights, which we have not been able to have \nsince I joined the Senate in January of 2013. This is an enormously \nimportant topic. We have not had a floor debate on any voting rights \nbill since I came to the Senate in 2013.\n  In this spirit of dialogue, I wanted to basically come and talk about \nSenate rules to respond to a question or a challenge that Republicans \nwere making on the floor last week. They pointed out that I, along with \na number of Democrats, had signed a letter in 2017, arguing, in their \nview, that we should not change the filibuster on legislation. They \ncited that, and they said: How can you stand on the floor now and \ncontemplate changes to the filibuster rule?\n  So what I wanted to do tonight is come to the floor and talk about \n2017, talk about things that have happened since 2017, and, frankly, \nexplain why I haven't really changed the position that I articulated in \nthe letter, but I have changed my views about whether the filibuster \naccomplishes the objective or cuts against it.\n  Finally, what I want to do at the end of that, of answering their \nquestion about that letter, is to reassure them--to reassure them that \nwhat we will reach for tomorrow is not a blowing up of the filibuster.\n  I heard my colleague from Alaska today say we wanted to blow up the \nfilibuster. No. Let me reassure all Republicans that that is not what \nthey are going to be asked to vote on tomorrow. They are going to be \nasked to restore the filibuster to what it was during the vast majority \nof the history of this body.\n  Here is the operant quote from the letter of 2017 that I signed. It \nwas in April of 2017, shortly after the Republicans had changed the \nSenate rules to ram through Neil Gorsuch after they had refused to even \nentertain the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. It \nwas a bipartisan letter. ``We are united in our determination to \npreserve the ability of Members to engage in extended debate when bills \nare on the Senate floor''--``extended debate when bills are on the \nSenate floor.''\n  Well, what has happened since that letter was written in April of \n2017?\n  First, those of us in the room know, as for extended debate on the \nSenate floor, are you kidding? It almost never happens. The filibuster \nrule that some of us hoped might facilitate that has become an obstacle \nto it. In fact, you can't even get a bill on the Senate floor because \nthe filibuster requirement, which was initially something about final \npassage, has been now imported even into proceeding to legislation. So \nwhen a majority of Members of the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld decide they want to talk about a topic, they can't. It is like \nthe 21st century's version of the gag rule, which prohibited \ndiscussions in Congress on items related to slavery during the 1830s \nand 1840s. There has been a gag rule prohibiting discussions of the \nvoting rights bill and other civil rights legislation and other \nimportant priorities because you can't even get on the bill, much less \nhave extended debate about it.\n\n  When you do get on the bill, how many bills around here do we have \nextended debate on? Mostly, we are in a Chamber like this, with three \npeople, and there is no real debate that is going on because the abuse \nof the filibuster leads a party to say: Well, gosh, if they can't get \n60 votes for something, we don't even have to show up. The old public \nfilibuster of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' days has now turned to a \nsecret, private filibuster where people can stay in their offices and \nnever show their faces on the floor.\n  So that notion of naive Senators like me in 2017, wherein we are \ndetermined to preserve the ability of Members to engage in extended \ndebate when bills are on the Senate floor, has been undermined by the \nfilibuster by making it hard to get bills on the floor and then \nguaranteeing, when they are on the floor, that nobody needs to show up.\n  Other things have happened since 2017. I needn't go over them at \nlength, but I will go over them.\n  I didn't imagine that we would have a President who would lead an \nassault on American democracy, who would lie and claim he won the \npopular vote in 2016 when he didn't, who would claim there was massive \nfraud in the Virginia election in 2016 when there wasn't, and who would \ngo to a foreign country and try to dig up dirt on a political opponent \nhe feared in 2020. I didn't imagine that those things would happen.\n  I didn't imagine that the President, having lost an election in \nNovember 2020, would encourage his followers to gather in DC to be \nwild. I didn't imagine that he would call the head of the Georgia \nelections and say: You have to find me thousands of votes so I can win. \nI didn't imagine those things.\n  I didn't imagine that there would be a violent attack here that would \ninjure 150 police officers, that there would be an effort to \ndisenfranchise 80 million Americans and disrupt the peaceful transfer \nof power. I didn't imagine those things.\n  I didn't imagine that States would do what my colleague from \nCalifornia has suggested: Look at what happened in 2020, embrace the \nTrump Big Lie, and decide then, boy, we have really got to carve this \nback. We have got to carve this back dramatically and make it harder \nfor particular groups of people who live in particular cities or \ncounties, based on whom they vote for, to vote. I didn't imagine those \nthings.\n  I will tell you something else I didn't imagine. I didn't imagine \nthat we wouldn't get any help from the Republican Party in addressing \nthese problems. The Republican Party throughout most of its history has \nbeen a great voting rights party. The 14th Amendment and the 15th \nAmendment only passed with Republican votes to guarantee people equal \naccess to the ballot. When the 19th Amendment was passed, guaranteeing \nwomen the right to vote, it was in a Democratic administration, the \nWilson administration, but Republicans were solidly on board. When the \n26th Amendment passed to give the franchise to 18-year-olds, it was in \nthe Nixon administration, and Democrats and Republicans were on board.\n  The Republican Party, from its origins, right before Lincoln was \nPresident, was always on the march and, frankly, usually leading the \nmarch to expand people's ability to participate in voting. There is no \nexample that is more dramatic than the passage of the 1965 Voting \nRights Act.\n  There was a 60-day filibuster here on the Senate floor. At the end, \nit was broken. Republicans voted for the Voting Rights Act near \nunanimously. Democrats were strong but not as solid as the Republicans \nwere. Then, over and over again in the years between 1965 and up \nthrough 2006, Republicans would vote unanimously or near unanimously to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act. But something changed between 2006 \nand 2013. Something changed at about the time that Barack Obama was \nelected President of the United States.\n  When the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Shelby case, \ngutted the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act but told \nCongress ``You can fix it'' and we went back to all of the Republicans \nwho had supported the Voting Rights Act from 1965 to 2006 and said \n``OK. The Supreme Court says here is what is wrong, and we can fix \nit,'' we have not been able to find any--any--Republican support save \nLisa Murkowski of this Chamber, who is a cosponsor of the John Lewis \nVoting Rights Act, the restoration of preclearance.\n  When I signed the letter in 2017, I could not have imagined that we \ncould not have found any Republican support on any voting rights issue.\n  I heard my colleague from Utah, Senator Romney, talk a second ago, \nand he said: Well, how come Democrats didn't do it? I started working \nwith Republicans in July--months before we filed the Freedom to Vote \nAct. Could you do it this way? Could you do it that way? What about if \nwe completely gave up the idea of any rule or filibuster reform. Would \nyou then engage with us?\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nHow about unlimited amendments? How about give us a counterproposal?\n  I have been in these discussions with Republican colleagues for \nmonths. Again, save Senator Murkowski on the John Lewis bill, there has \nbeen no help forthcoming to save our democracy, to save voting.\n  So, when colleagues ask, ``Well, you signed a letter in 2017, and \nthat letter said that we should preserve the ability of Members to \nengage in extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor. So why \nare you now contemplating rules changes?'' my answer to them is that I \nam contemplating rules changes to do exactly that. We don't have \nextended debate on the Senate floor. You can't get bills on the Senate \nfloor. Our democracy is under attack, and voting is under attack. \nContrary to the previous 150-year history of your party, you won't lift \na finger to protect voting rights or protect the integrity of our \nelections, but because you won't doesn't mean we should not. In fact, \nif you won't, the burden is on our shoulders even more.\n  Here is something else, I will be honest, that I have come to \nunderstand more about the filibuster since 2017. Then I want to \nconclude by offering some words of reassurance to my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  The fact that the filibuster is now used indiscriminately against \neverything does not cleanse it of the stench of its predominant use in \nour history to block civil rights legislation. I mean, now we use the \nfilibuster to block what might be a nonconsequential appointment. We \nuse it for everything. However, when the history of the filibuster is \nwritten in this Chamber, the pivotal, epic moments that will get \nremembered are Robert Byrd's 14-hour-and-13-minute speech to try to \nfilibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Strom Thurmond's \nmassive filibuster against civil rights laws, and Senators from \nVirginia--Senators who held the seat that I now occupy--filibustering \nagainst civil rights laws.\n  You don't cleanse the stench from the filibuster by just suddenly \nusing it for everything. You still have to acknowledge it has played a \nparticular role in the Senate. Sadly, that role has usually been to the \ndetriment of the kinds of people who couldn't see anybody who looked \nlike them in the Senate.\n  I occupy a seat that was occupied for 50 years by Harry Byrd, Sr., \nand Harry Byrd, Jr. It is called the Byrd seat in the Senate because \nthe Byrd machine ran Virginia politics, and they kind of owned it. \nHarry Byrd, Sr., was Governor in the 1920s and came to the Senate when \nCarter Glass died in 1933 and stayed until he died in 1966. His son, \nHarry Byrd, Jr., was then appointed to the Senate until 1983. For 50 \nyears, the Byrds held the seat I now occupy.\n  I was at the inauguration of our new Governor in Richmond on \nSaturday, and I walked by an empty place on the Capitol Square where, \njust 6 months ago, there was a statue of Harry Byrd, Sr.--the Governor \nwho was a great highway builder and infrastructure guy; the Governor \nwho came up with the idea and worked with President Roosevelt to build \nthe Shenandoah National Park; the Governor who then, as Senator, led \nthis Byrd machine and was viewed as the dominant figure in Virginia \npolitical life during the 20th century, together with his son, Harry \nByrd, Jr.--but the statue was taken down. The statue was taken down 7 \nmonths ago.\n  The middle school that was named for Harry Byrd, Sr., in Henrico \nCounty was renamed 5 years ago to Quioccasin Middle School. Why was \nthat? Highway builder, park developer, dominant political figure, his \nstatue was taken down because of what he did in the U.S. Senate; that \nhe would write the southern manifesto to rally Senators against Brown \nv. Board; that he would encourage Virginia public school systems--\nagain, this is as a Senator, not as a Governor; he encouraged Virginia \npublic school systems--to shut down rather than integrate; that he \nwould engage in one filibuster after the next against civil rights \nlegislation, including the Voting Rights Acts, and never apologized, \nnever admit he was wrong, unlike Robert Byrd, who was a Klansman before \nhe was in the U.S. Senate and who filibustered famously against civil \nrights legislation until he had an epiphany in 1968 when he voted for \nthe Fair Housing Act and apologized for the rest of his life and became \na civil rights champion. Harry Byrd, Sr., used the filibuster for, \nfrankly, what it has been used for around here--to exclude people from \nthe democracy. And the tributes to Harry Byrd and the statues and the \nschool names are all coming down.\n  Even at the university in his own hometown, Shenandoah University in \nWinchester, which had named its business school after Harry Byrd, Jr., \nthey wiped that name off, because the filibuster is not just like a \nSenate rule that can be used like anything else. It has been used for a \nparticular purpose, and we can't be blind to that.\n  But let me just say this, as I conclude. I want to offer my \ncolleagues a reassurance--those who have asked why we are contemplating \nrules changes, those who signed the letter with us, because it was a \nbipartisan letter. It was led by Senators Coons and Collins, and many \nRepublicans signed it. ``We are united in our determination to preserve \nthe ability of Members to engage in extended debate when bills are on \nthe Senate floor.'' For the first time in my Senate career, there is a \nvoting rights bill on the Senate floor, and we will have a rules \nadjustment vote at the end of the day tomorrow, in all likelihood. And \nwhat will that vote be? Will the vote be to eliminate the filibuster? \nNo. Will the vote be to abolish the filibuster? No. Will it be to \nweaken the filibuster? No.\n  Here is the vote that we will vote on tomorrow: Should we change the \nsecret filibuster that allows Members to just sit in their office and \nnot take the floor and not explain their opposition to their colleagues \nand not have to face the American public? Should we change that secret \nfilibuster into a public filibuster, the way it was done during the \nvast majority of Senate history, where Senators who went to block \naction by a majority should at least have to do the work, should at \nleast have to come to the floor and explain to their colleagues and the \nAmerican public why the majority should not act?\n  For everyone on the Republican side who signed that letter saying we \nshould have extended debate on the Senate floor and it should not be \ncurtailed, we are giving you a chance to do exactly what you pledged to \ndo. For every one in our own caucus who has expressed reticence about \nweakening or diminishing the filibuster, we are giving you exactly the \nthing that you said you wanted--an opportunity to have full debate that \ncould go on for a very long time and not be curtailed. And the only \nthing we will require is that that debate actually happen in the view \nof the American public and your colleagues, a fundamental opportunity \nfor all of us to do the right thing by Senate rules to accomplish the \nright thing for our democracy. I so welcome the chance to finally have \nthis debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, I rise today to urge the Senate to take \naction to protect voting rights and to defend our democracy. Voting is \nfoundational to our democracy. In a strong, functioning democracy, the \nplaying field is level. Citizens have a right to vote, and neither one \nside nor the other has the right to block those voters from the ballot \nbox or from getting their votes counted.\n  That basic premise no longer holds in America. Let's be blunt. \nAmerican democracy is under attack from Republican politicians. In the \npast year alone, Republican State legislatures have passed laws in \nnearly 20 States to restrict American citizens' right to vote.\n  The Republican nominees to the Supreme Court have destroyed \nlongstanding protections against dark money in politics; they have \ngiven the green light to partisan gerrymandering; and they have gutted \nthe Voting Rights Act. Republican dark money networks are bankrolling \nvoter suppression efforts with hundreds of millions of dollars in \nlobbying and advertising.\n  And for years and years, Republican Donald Trump and Republican \npoliticians have spread lies about the integrity of our elections. Last \nJanuary 6, a Republican President, backed up by Republicans right here \nin this Senate, provoked a deadly insurrection at our Nation's Capitol.\n  And in the intervening year, Republican leaders have refused to \naccept evidence of President Biden's 7 million-vote victory over Donald \nTrump. Instead, they have fed conspiracies and lies that further \nundermine our democracy.\n  Yes, American democracy is under attack, and, today, 50 Democratic \nSenators agree on the right response to this attack. The Freedom to \nVote Act would guarantee that every American citizen can easily vote \nand get their vote counted.\n  The act would defend against attempts to overturn the will of the \npeople; the act would reform our broken campaign finance system and \nhelp root out dark money; and, critically important, the act would ban \npartisan gerrymandering by either side.\n  The companion bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, \nwould restore historic protections against State laws that have the \npurpose and the effect of discriminating on the basis of race.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans would rather destroy our democracy \nthan have free and fair elections, and so they support those around the \ncountry who are trying to block access to voting and who are trying to \nrig how votes get counted.\n  Elections are about the will of the majority, but the Republicans in \nthe Senate don't want what a majority of Americans want. In fact, the \n50 Republicans in the Senate, together, represent 41\\1/2\\ million fewer \nAmericans than the Democratic majority, but instead of taking a simple \nvote to protect American citizens' access to the polls, they want to \nstop legislation to defend the very foundation of our democracy from \neven getting a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let me be clear. My view on this is that the filibuster has no place \nin our democracy. Our Founders believed deeply in protections for the \nminority, and those are enshrined in the Constitution and in the \nstructure of Congress. But our Founders made it clear that, after \nextended debate, the majority could always get a vote. And that final \nvote--except in the case of treaties and impeachment--would always be \nby simple majority. The Founders did not add a filibuster. With two \nexceptions, they insisted on plain old majority rule.\n  When the Senate changed its rules a decade later, the filibuster \nbecame the favored tool of racists and segregationists. The filibuster \npreserved Jim Crow laws and stalled civil rights legislation for \ndecades. The filibuster helped block the passage of anti-lynching \nlegislation for over 100 years. The filibuster nearly stopped Congress \nfrom passing the most important voting rights law in our Nation's \nhistory--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Today's filibuster does not foster bipartisanship and compromise. In \nfact, the exact opposite is true. The filibuster has been weaponized to \nintensify partisan division.\n  The filibuster is a wicked tool used to kill legislation supported by \nthe majority of Americans of all political parties, and that is true \nfor protecting the right to vote and gun safety legislation and \nimmigration reform and codifying Roe v. Wade.\n  The filibuster thwarts the will of the people. Today's filibuster \ndoesn't encourage debate; it promotes power. Senators can torpedo bills \nwithout saying a single word in public or even stepping to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. This is not how a so-called deliberative body should \noperate.\n  Senators should be required to talk and vote instead of hiding behind \na rule. They should have to put skin in the game. If Republicans are \nfine with the wave of anti-voter laws being enacted in State after \nState, then they should have to come to the floor and make that clear. \nIf Republicans oppose reinstating the Voting Rights Act that passed in \nthis Chamber unanimously in 2006, their constituents and the historical \nrecord should know exactly where they stand.\n  Instead, because of how today's filibuster works, we have two sets of \nrules in our country, one for Democrats, who want to promote civil \nrights and liberties, and another set for Republicans, who want to take \nthem away. Republicans who want to close polling places, who want to \nlimit voting, who want to pass gerrymandered maps are hard at work \ndoing that right now with simple majorities in State legislatures all \nacross this country. They face no filibusters to stop them. It is \nmajority rule all the way.\n\n  And here in Washington, when Republicans want to pass massive tax \ncuts for billionaires and rig our Tax Code to favor big businesses, an \nexception to the filibuster lets them do just that with a simple \nmajority.\n  Republicans who want to pack the Supreme Court with extremists \nJustices who roll back fundamental rights and who disregard the rule of \nlaw can do that with a simple majority right here in the U.S. Senate. \nBut a majority of Democratic Senators--again, Democrats who, together, \nrepresent over 40 million more Americans than the Republican Senators--\na majority of Democrats cannot pass legislation to improve the lives of \nAmericans.\n  Democrats want to raise the minimum wage; Democrats want to lower the \ncost of prescription drugs and healthcare; and Democrats want to \nprotect the right to vote. But too often we cannot achieve these goals \nbecause the filibuster gives the minority party an almost total veto \nover legislation, including the legislation we need to save our \nAmerican democracy.\n  We can't ignore Republicans' attempts to rig free and fair elections \nin this country. We can't roll over when Republicans want to make it \nharder for Black Americans to vote. We can't look the other way when \nRepublicans want to make it tough for Latinos and Asian Americans to \nvote.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  We can't be silent when Republicans make voting harder on Tribal \nlands. We can't shrink back when Republicans work to keep students from \nvoting. We can't turn away when Republicans try to keep working-class \npeople or anyone who might be more inclined to vote for Democrats--keep \nthem away from the polls. That is not how democracy works.\n  In a democracy, the most votes win--period. In a democracy, the \nSenate debates, and then the Senate votes. And in a democracy, the \npeople--not the politicians--decide who will lead the Nation.\n  This week, the eyes of the Nation and the entire world are on the \nU.S. Senate. We can choose to protect the tool of Jim Crow and \nsegregation that is found nowhere in the Constitution or we can choose \nto defend the sacred right to vote.\n  I urge the Senate to protect our democracy and to protect the right \nof every American citizen to vote and to have their vote counted.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have made the dishonest claim that \nthere is no voter suppression crisis, and there is no need for Federal \nvoting rights legislation. So I would like to enter into the Record a \nseries of articles that demonstrate the voter suppression taking place \nin State after State in this country.\n  I will start by reminding everyone that the Supreme Court--led by \nChief Justice John Roberts--opened the door to all of these anti-voter \ntactics by gutting preclearance from the Voting Rights Act and by \nturning its back on equal justice under law.\n  So first I will read excerpts from an article published in Vox on \nJuly 21, 2021, entitled: ``How America lost its commitment to the right \nto vote.''\n\n       The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan lamented in a \n     dissenting opinion earlier this month, ``has treated no \n     statute worse'' than the Voting Rights Act.\n       She's right.\n       The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most successful civil \n     rights law in [all of] American history. Originally signed in \n     1965, it was the United States' first serious attempt since \n     Reconstruction to build a multiracial democracy--and it \n     worked. Just two years after President Lyndon Johnson signed \n     the Voting Rights Act into law, Black voter registration . . \n     . in the Jim Crow stronghold of Mississippi skyrocketed from \n     6.7 percent to nearly 60 percent.\n       And yet, in a trio of cases--Shelby County v. Holder [in] \n     (2013), Abbott v. Perez [in] (2018), and Brnovich v. DNC [in] \n     (2021)--the Court drained nearly all of the life out of this \n     landmark civil rights statute.\n       After Brnovich, the decision that inspired [Justice] \n     Kagan's statement that the Court has treated the Voting \n     Rights Act worse than any other federal law, it's unclear \n     whether the Supreme Court would rule in favor of voting \n     rights plaintiffs even if [the] state legislature tried to \n     outright rig an election.\n       These cases are the culmination of more than half a century \n     of efforts by conservatives who, after failing to convince \n     elected lawmakers to weaken voting rights, turned to an \n     unelected judiciary to enact a policy that would never have \n     made it through Congress. All of this is bad news for \n     minority voters in America, who are [the] most likely to be \n     disadvantaged by many of the new restrictions currently being \n     pushed in statehouses across America, and for the country's \n     relatively young commitment to multiracial democracy. And \n     there are at least three reasons to fear that decisions like \n     Shelby County and Brnovich foreshadow even more aggressive \n     attacks on the right to vote.\n       The first is that Republican partisans can use race as a \n     proxy to identify communities with large numbers of \n     Democratic voters. In 2020, according to the Pew Research \n     Center, 92 percent of non-Hispanic Black voters supported \n     Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump--and that's \n     after Trump slightly improved his performance among African \n     Americans compared to 2016.\n       That means that state lawmakers who wish to prevent \n     Democrats from voting can do so through policies that make it \n     harder for Black voters (and, to a lesser extent, most other \n     nonwhite voters) to cast a ballot. And Republican lawmakers \n     haven't been shy about doing so. As a federal appeals court \n     wrote in 2016 about a North Carolina law that included many \n     provisions making it harder to vote, ``the new provisions \n     target African Americans with almost surgical precision.''\n       An even starker example: Georgia recently enacted a law \n     that effectively enables the state Republican Party to \n     disqualify voters and shut down polling precincts. If the \n     state GOP wields this law to close down most of the polling \n     places in the highly Democratic, majority-Black city of \n     Atlanta, it's unclear that a Voting Rights Act that's been \n     gravely wounded by three Supreme Court decisions remains \n     vibrant enough to block them.\n       The second reason to be concerned about decisions like \n     Brnovich is that the Supreme Court's attacks on the Voting \n     Rights Act are not isolated. They are part of a greater web \n     of decisions making it much harder for voting rights \n     plaintiffs to prevail in court.\n       These cases include decisions like Purcell v. Gonzalez [in] \n     (2006), which announced that judges should be very reluctant \n     to block unlawful state voting rules close to an election; \n     Crawford v. Marion County Election Board [in] (2008), which \n     permitted states to enact voting restrictions that target \n     largely imaginary problems; and Rucho v. Common Cause [in] \n     (2019), which would ban federal courts from hearing partisan \n     gerrymandering lawsuits because the Court's GOP-appointed \n     majority deemed such cases too ``difficult to adjudicate.''\n       Finally, decisions like Shelby County and Brnovich are \n     troubling because the Court's reasoning in those opinions \n     appears completely divorced from the actual text of the \n     Constitution and from the text of federal laws such as the \n     Voting Rights Act. Shelby County eliminated the Voting Rights \n     Act's requirement that states with a history of racist \n     election practices ``preclear'' any new voting rules with \n     officials in Washington, DC. It was rooted in what Chief \n     Justice John Roberts described as ``the principle that all \n     States enjoy equal sovereignty,'' a principle that is never \n     mentioned once in the text of the U.S. Constitution.\n       In Brnovich, the Court upheld two Arizona laws that \n     disenfranchise voters who vote in the wrong precinct and \n     limit who can deliver an absentee ballot to a polling place. \n     [Justice] Alito purports to take ``a fresh look at the \n     statutory text'' in this case. But he imposes new limits on \n     the Voting Rights Act--such as a strong presumption that \n     voting restrictions that were in place in 1982 are lawful, or \n     a similar presumption favoring state laws purporting to \n     prevent voter fraud--[qualifications] which have no basis \n     whatsoever in the law's text.\n       As [Justice] Kagan writes in dissent, Brnovich ``mostly \n     inhabits a law-free zone.''\n       That doesn't necessarily mean that this Supreme Court will \n     allow any restriction on voting to stand--under the most \n     optimistic reading of cases like Brnovich, the Court might \n     still intervene if Georgia tries to close down most of the \n     polling places in Atlanta--but it does mean that voting \n     rights lawyers and their clients can no longer expect to win \n     their cases simply because Congress passed a law protecting \n     their right to vote.\n       The rules in American elections are now what [Justice] \n     Roberts and his five even more conservative colleagues say \n     they are--not what the Constitution or any act of Congress \n     has to say about voting rights.\n\n  Mr. President, Republicans are not just content with making it harder \nto vote. They are also passing State laws allowing them to replace \nlocal election officials with those who will administer elections in \ntheir favor. Unsurprisingly, they are targeting areas with huge Black \npopulations, like Atlanta, that helped determine the outcome of the \n2020 election cycle.\n  And they are targeting smaller places, too. As described in an \narticle published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on December 29, \n2021, entitled ``New Election Board in Lincoln County Seeks Central \nVoting Site,'' a replacement elections board is planning to close all \nseven polling places in Lincoln County, north of Augusta, requiring in-\nperson voters to report to one centralized location. The poll closures \nwould reduce voting access for rural residents, who would have to drive \n15 miles or more to cast a ballot in a county with no public \ntransportation option, leading to opposition from voting rights \nadvocates.\n  The plan is moving forward after a State law passed this year \nabolished the previous county elections board and gave a majority of \nappointments to the Republican county commissioner. Now, Lincoln is one \nof six counties where the Republican-controlled Georgia General \nAssembly reorganized local elections boards.\n  ``This is about the powerful flexing their muscles and saying, `We \ncan do whatever we want to do and who is going to stop us?' '' said the \nReverend Denise Freeman, who is organizing Lincoln voters to oppose the \npoll closures. She goes on to say: ``In Lincoln County, it's always \nbeen about power and control.''\n  The remade board is the same as before, with one exception: A \nDemocratic Party appointee was replaced by an appointee of the county \ncommission, whose five members are all Republicans. The elections board \ncould vote on the poll closure plan on January 19.\n  ``Folks should have access to their polling locations. They should be \nable to vote without having to drive 30 minutes to get there,'' said \nCindy Battles of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a civil \nrights group that has been collecting voter signatures for a petition \ndrive to try to stop the closures.\n  There is no public transportation available in Lincoln County, nor \nare\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nthere taxis, Uber or Lyft. Anyone who wants to vote would have to drive \nor walk to a polling place, or return an absentee ballot. Turnout \ndecreases when voters have to travel farther to cast a ballot, \naccording to a statistical analysis by the Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution.\n  Polling places can be closed by a majority vote in Lincoln County, \nand the Federal Government has no oversight role. A 2013 U.S. Supreme \nCourt decision removed the requirements of the Voting Rights Act for \nStates with a history of discrimination, including Georgia, to obtain \nFederal preclearance before making changes to voting practices and \nlocations.\n\n  And what happened?\n  County election boards closed 214 precincts across Georgia between \n2012 and 2018. That is nearly 8 percent of the State's total polling \nplaces, according to a count by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n  Mr. President, Republican efforts have already succeeded at \ndisenfranchising voters, especially Black voters. So I now want to \nshare the impact that limiting polling places had on voters during the \nlast Presidential election in Georgia, using an excerpt from an NPR \narticle published on October 17, 2020, entitled ``Why Do Nonwhite \nGeorgia Voters Have to Wait in Line for Hours? Too Few Polling \nPlaces.''\n  Here is the story:\n\n       Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she pulled into \n     the Christian City Welcome Center about 3:30 p.m., ready to \n     cast her ballot in the June 9 primary election.\n       Hundreds of people were waiting in the heat and rain \n     outside the lush, tree-lined complex in Union City, an \n     Atlanta suburb with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them \n     Black. She briefly considered not casting a ballot at all, \n     but she decided to stay.\n       By the time she got inside more than five hours later, five \n     hours later, the polls had officially closed and the \n     electronic scanners were all shut down. Poll workers told her \n     she would have to cast a provisional ballot, but they \n     promised that her vote would be counted.\n       ``I'm now angry again, I'm frustrated again, and now I have \n     an added emotion, which is anxiety,'' said Kathy, a human \n     services worker, recalling her emotions at the time. She \n     asked that her full name not be used because she fears \n     repercussions from speaking out. ``I'm wondering if my ballot \n     is going to count.''\n       By the time the last voter finally got inside the welcome \n     center to cast a ballot, it was the next day, June 10.\n       The clogged polling locations in metro Atlanta reflect an \n     underlying pattern: the number of places to vote has shrunk \n     statewide, with little recourse. Although the reduction in \n     polling places has taken place across racial lines, it has \n     primarily caused long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where \n     voter registration has surged and more residents cast ballots \n     in person on Election Day. The pruning of polling places \n     started long before the pandemic, which has discouraged \n     people from voting in person.\n       In Georgia, which is considered a battleground State for \n     control of the White House and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of \n     voting in Black communities like Union City could possibly \n     tip the results on November 3. With massive turnout expected, \n     lines could be even longer than they were for the primary, \n     despite a rise in mail-in voting and Georgians already \n     turning out by the hundreds of thousands to cast ballots \n     early.\n\n  Since the U.S. Supreme Court's Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 \neliminated key federal oversight of election decisions in states with \nhistories of discrimination, Georgia's voter rolls have grown by nearly \n2 million people, yet polling locations have been cut statewide by \nnearly 10%, [this is] according to an analysis of state and local \nrecords by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica. Much of the \ngrowth has been fueled by younger, nonwhite voters, especially in nine \nmetro Atlanta counties, where four out of five new voters were \nnonwhite, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\n\n       The metro Atlanta area has been hit particularly hard. The \n     nine counties--Fulton, Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall, \n     Cherokee, Henry and Clayton--have nearly half the state's \n     active voters but only 38% of the polling places, according \n     to the analysis.\n       As a result, the average number of voters packed into each \n     polling location in those counties grew by nearly 40%, from \n     about 2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling place as \n     of October 9. In addition, a last-minute push that opened \n     more than 90 polling places just weeks before the November \n     election has left many voters uncertain about where to vote \n     or how long they might have to wait to cast a ballot.\n       The growth of registered voters has outstripped the number \n     of available polling places in both predominantly White and \n     Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer \n     in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than \n     Whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and \n     they are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S. \n     census data and recent studies. Georgia Public Broadcasting/\n     ProPublica found that about two-thirds of the polling places \n     that had to stay open late for the June primary to \n     accommodate waiting voters were in majority-Black \n     neighborhoods, even though those neighborhoods made up only \n     about one-third of the State's polling places.\n\n  An analysis by Stanford University political science professor \nJonathan Roddin of the data that was collected by the Georgia Public \nBroadcasting/ProPublica found that the average wait time after 7 p.m. \nacross Georgia was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more \nnonwhite.\n  That is 51 minutes in polling places that were 90 percent or more \nnon-White, but only 6 minutes in polling places that were 90 percent \nWhite.\n  Georgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters for a polling place that has \nexperienced significant voter delays, but that limit is rarely, if \never, enforced. Our analysis found that, in both majority Black and \nmajority White neighborhoods, about 9 out of every 10 precincts are \nassigned to polling places with more than 2,000 people.\n  A June 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New \nYork University Law Center found that the average number of voters \nassigned to a polling place has grown in the past 5 years in Georgia, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina--all States with substantial \nBlack populations that, before the Supreme Court's Shelby decision, \nneeded Federal approval to close polling places under the Voting Rights \nAct, and though dozens of States have regulations on the size of voting \nprecincts and polling places or the number of voting machines, the \nanalysis found that many jurisdictions simply do not abide by them.\n  Georgia's State leadership and election officials have largely \nignored complaints about poll consolidations, even as they tout record \ngrowth in voter registration. As secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, \nwhen most of Georgia's poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, now the \nGovernor, took a laissez-faire attitude toward county-run election \npractices, save for a 2015 document that spelled out methods officials \ncould use to shutter polling places to show ``how the change can \nbenefit voters and the public interest.''\n  Kemp's office declined to comment Thursday on the letter or as to why \npoll closures went unchallenged by State officials. His spokesperson \nreferred to his previous statements that he did not encourage officials \nto close polling places but merely offered guidance on how to follow \nthe law.\n  The inaction has left Black voters in Georgia facing barriers \nreminiscent of Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a political science \nprofessor at Morehouse College in Atlanta, who has studied the impact \nof the landmark Shelby decision on Black voters. Voter suppression ``is \nhappening with these voter impediments that are being imposed,'' Jones \nsaid. ``You're closing down polling places so people have a more \ndifficult time getting there. You're making vote-by-mail difficult or \nconfusing. Now we're in court arguing about which ballots are going to \nbe accepted, and it means that people have less trust in our state.''\n  Despite false Republican claims to the contrary, voter ID laws \ndisproportionately harm people of color, rural Americans, and poor \nAmericans.\n  I now want to read an article from ABC News. They published it on \nOctober 5, 2021. It tells the story of Texas voter ID laws, and it is \nentitled ``Black woman in rural Texas struggles with process to vote, \nadvocates say system is unfair.''\n\n       While voters across Texas submitted voter registration \n     applications on Monday, October 4, ahead of the Nov. 2 \n     statewide election, 82-year-old Elmira Hicks worried she \n     would not be able to have her vote counted.\n       The Oakwood, Texas, native said she hasn't been able to \n     renew her driver's license for more than a year because she \n     has been unable to present the required birth certificate \n     needed to verify her identity.\n       In the Lone Star State, election laws require voters to \n     present a driver's license, passport, military identification \n     card, citizenship certificate, state election identification \n     certificate or a personal identification card to cast a \n     ballot in person.\n       A person does not need an ID to register to vote, or to \n     vote by mail in the state of Texas.\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\n       For voters ages 70 and over, an otherwise valid form of ID \n     may be presented when casting a ballot, even if it's expired, \n     according to the office of the . . . Secretary of State.\n       If a voter does not possess or cannot reasonably obtain one \n     of the seven acceptable forms of photo ID, the voter may file \n     a Reasonable Impediment Declaration and present a supporting \n     form of ID, [like] a bank statement, current utility bill, \n     paycheck or government check.\n       Hicks and her daughter, Jonita White, said they were \n     unaware of the RID process, and that without a driver's \n     license and limited transportation, it's difficult for Hicks \n     to participate in state and federal elections.\n       ``My voice does not count.'' Hicks told ABC News. ``It's \n     very important. People have died just to vote, people have \n     stood in line, in the rain, women fought to vote and now I \n     can't vote.''\n       Like many Black elders in the South, Hicks was born at a \n     time when records weren't kept. She never had a birth \n     certificate. Her daughter has helped her apply for one. The \n     pair even went to court over the issue, and said a judge \n     ruled in their favor. Still, they said the Office of Vital \n     Statistics rejected Hicks because she filled out an outdated \n     form.\n       ``I do feel like the laws right now are targeting my mother \n     and other African Americans in this country,'' White said.\n       Eight state constitutional amendments ranging from taxes to \n     judicial eligibility will be up for a vote on Nov. 2, in an \n     election that, as of now, Hicks [cannot] participate in.\n       Advocates warn that potentially thousands of predominantly \n     minority voters could be disenfranchised due to voter \n     identification requirements, which could have large \n     implications during next year's midterm elections for state \n     and congressional races.\n       ``It's often very common for people of a certain age not to \n     have a birth certificate. I want to emphasize it's not as \n     uncommon as people might believe,'' said Franita Tolson, the \n     vice dean for faculty and academic affairs and a professor of \n     law at the University of Southern California Gould School of \n     Law.\n       ``In this country, race correlates to a lot of different \n     characteristics. So, for example, if you take voter \n     identification laws . . . people of color, so African \n     Americans, Latinos, will be less likely to have the \n     underlying documents that you need in order to get the ID in \n     the first place in order to get a driver's license,'' Tolson \n     [said].\n       Texas recently passed the Election Integrity Protection \n     Act, one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. \n     It bans drive-thru voting, enlists new regulations for early \n     voting and enacts new ID requirements for mail-in voting.\n       While Tolson does not believe all voter identification \n     requirements are discriminatory, she called Texas' voter ID \n     measures ``racist'' during a Congressional Subcommittee \n     hearing on September 22 because she believes they \n     disproportionately impact voters of color.\n       ``Texas has very restrictive voter ID law,'' Tolson said. \n     ``If you read it, it doesn't seem racist on its face, but if \n     you think about how it operates in practice, as well as the \n     intent behind it, it is fairly racist. For example, Texas' \n     law only allows voters to have a certain limited amount of \n     IDs. You have to have a driver's license, you can have a . . \n     . handgun license, you can have a military ID, but you can't \n     have a federal ID, or you can't have a student ID, which are \n     types of IDs that people of color are more likely to have.''\n       White said obtaining an election identification is not so \n     easy for an 82-year-old woman who lives in a rural area \n     without the convenient ability to drive herself to the \n     Department of Public Safety.\n       ``My challenge is it's taking so long to get this done,'' \n     White said. ``And to send my mother through all of these \n     hoops at this age to go get documents notarized, to go get \n     her Social Security application, We're having to look for \n     high school records and baptism information . . . To send her \n     through such a process, it really is ridiculous.''\n\n  Latino communities have also been at the forefront of the fight for \nsocial, racial, and economic justice, but Republican gerrymandering is \nsilencing these communities as described in the following article, \npublished by the Brennan Center, on November 14, 2021, entitled ``It's \nTime to Stop Gerrymandering Latinos out of Political Power.''\n\n       In 2020, Latinos made up just 1 percent of all local and \n     federal elected officials, despite being 18 percent of the \n     population.\n       In fact, the 2020 census results show that Latinos made up \n     over half the country's population growth from 2010 to 2020, \n     adding 11.6 million people to their total numbers--more by \n     far than any other ethnic group in absolute terms. Latinos \n     are already the largest minority group in 21 states, and in \n     California and New Mexico they have already surpassed non-\n     Latino whites as the largest single ethnic group in the \n     state. In Texas, they are poised to do the same.\n       In states where growth among Latinos and other people of \n     color threaten the political status quo, lawmakers are \n     already beginning to gerrymander Latino communities out of \n     their political voice, packing them into fewer and fewer \n     districts to circumscribe their electoral power or \n     dispersing Latino communities across multiple districts in \n     order to dilute their voting strength. In Texas, for \n     example, lawmakers recently passed a new congressional map \n     that reduced the number of Latino-majority districts--\n     despite the fact that the state has actually added 2 \n     million Latinos since 2010.\n       This isn't a new tactic. Last decade, Texas failed to \n     create any new electoral opportunities for Latinos despite \n     rapid and concentrated Latino growth, leading to years of \n     drawn-out litigation over the discriminatory scheme. \n     Likewise, successful litigation in Florida demonstrated that \n     lawmakers packed Latino voters into already heavily \n     Democratic districts to shore up Republican districts at the \n     expense of Latino voters. Even in states under Democratic \n     control, like Illinois and Washington, Latinos are often \n     shuffled between different districts to bolster safe \n     Democratic seats and denied the equal opportunity to elect \n     representatives of their choice.\n       Even with record turnout in 2020, Latino voters were, by \n     many accounts, neglected by Republican and Democratic \n     campaigns alike. This comes at a time when Latino communities \n     are in particular need of responsiveness from lawmakers. Over \n     the course of the pandemic, Latinos have been 2.8 times more \n     likely to die of COVID-19 and suffered more economic and job \n     losses than other Americans. And since the pandemic began, \n     Latino adults were more likely to get evicted and their \n     children more likely to fall behind in school than their \n     white peers.\n       But rather than address the concerns and desires of this \n     growing body of constituents, many states, like Texas and \n     Florida, have instead created new barriers to the ballot box. \n     Anti-Latino redistricting practices are occurring amid the \n     biggest voter suppression push in decades--much of it aimed \n     at diminishing the growing power of Latino communities.\n       These attacks on Latino voters have deep roots in \n     historical prejudice and violence going back over a century. \n     Often erased in U.S. history books, violent mobs are \n     estimated to have killed thousands of people of Mexican \n     descent in the early 20th century. Forgotten too is the \n     campaign by state and local officials to ``repatriate'' (that \n     is, forcibly move to Mexico) an estimated 2 million Mexican \n     Americans during the Great Depression, many of whom were U.S. \n     citizens. Later, even the Voting Rights Act of 1965 failed to \n     initially protect Puerto Ricans from English literacy tests \n     at the New York polls--``language minorities'' weren't \n     included in the law until 10 years after its passage.\n\n  Though the Latino population has grown and grown more diverse over \nthe past 50 years, the pattern of discrimination remains strikingly \nunchanged. Every day, lawmakers across the country are recycling the \nbad map-drawing practices that have stymied Latino political \nopportunity for decades. Voters and advocates can challenge these maps \nin court, but they will be hampered by courts' restrictive \ninterpretation of voting rights laws and the ability for map drawers, \nafter the Supreme Court green-lighted partisan gerrymandering, to claim \nthat Latinas were targeted for partisan reasons, not for their \nethnicity. And that is why it is more urgent than ever that Congress \nrepair and strengthen the Nation's voting rights laws by passing the \nJohn R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote \nAct.\n\n  Asian-American voters are turning out at record levels, and it is no \ncoincidence that Republican State legislatures are responding with new \nlaws to suppress their voices.\n  I will now read from an NBC News article from March 31, 2021, about \nthe effect of Georgia's recently enacted voter suppression law on \nAsian-American voters. This is entitled ``Asian American voter rights \nin Georgia hit record high. How voting bill threatens progress.''\n\n       While new data shows Asian Americans had record turnout in \n     Georgia in the last election, a new law that restricts voting \n     in the state threatens their participation in the political \n     process, particularly at a time when they also have the \n     highest rates of absentee voting, critics say.\n       The new legislation, passed with the overwhelming support \n     of Republicans in the state Legislature last week, adds \n     restrictions to absentee and early voting, among other forms \n     of balloting. Critics say the law could disproportionately \n     affect communities of color, including Asian Americans, whose \n     voting population already confronts significant barriers to \n     civic engagement.\n       The bill, activists say, is particularly alarming in light \n     of a recent analysis by the policy nonprofit AAPI Data on \n     turnout in battleground states that showed a historic 84 \n     percent vote gain in Georgia by Asian Americans from 2016 to \n     2020--a result, in part, of aggressive community outreach.\n       ``Voters of color, including Asian American voters, have \n     shown their electoral power in Georgia,'' Phi Nguyen, a \n     litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-\n     Atlanta told NBC. . . . ``And now some elected leaders want \n     to try to suppress those voices rather than be accountable to \n     a diverse, multiracial, multiethnic electorate.''\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n       Critics said that the bill--which was fast tracked through \n     the state House and Senate and signed by Republican Gov. \n     Brian Kemp in just over an hour--was passed without public \n     notice to advocates or voters. The sweeping legislation \n     criminalizes ``line warming,'' the practice of offering food \n     and water to voters waiting to vote, and allows the Georgia \n     Legislature to take power from local boards of election.\n       In regards to absentee and early voting, the earliest date \n     a voter can request a ballot is 11 weeks ahead of an \n     election, less than half the time before the law [before the \n     law was passed]. And the deadline to complete the ballots has \n     been moved up as well. Both requesting and returning ballots \n     requires identification, such as a driver's license number, \n     state ID number or a copy of an acceptable voter ID.\n       The restrictions on absentee voting, Nguyen said, are \n     particularly concerning given that Asian Americans voted by \n     mail at the highest rate compared to all other racial groups \n     in the general election. Voting data from November showed \n     that in 13 of the most contested battleground states, \n     including Georgia, AAPI early and absentee voting rose almost \n     300 percent from 2016 [to 2020].\n       Nguyen further pointed out that any laws that make voting \n     more challenging have a particularly amplified impact on \n     those who are limited English proficient, or people who have \n     difficulty communicating in English. The Asian American \n     population has some of the highest rates of limited English \n     proficiency. And according to Pew Research, Asian Americans \n     are the only group made up of a majority of naturalized \n     immigrants, who account for two-thirds of the electorate.\n       With a high immigrant population, Asian Americans face \n     barriers beyond just language, Karthick Ramakrishnan, [an] \n     associate dean [for] the University of California Riverside \n     School of Public Policy and founder of AAPI Data, said. \n     Because the majority of the electorate is foreign born, most \n     Asian Americans most likely did not grow up in a [Democratic] \n     or [a] Republican household, he said. For those who were able \n     to get college degrees, they probably attended universities \n     in their home country, which influenced their knowledge of \n     the political process.\n       ``What that means is that the political awakening and \n     consciousness and even information about where the party \n     stands on issues and where candidates stand on issues--the \n     barriers are pretty high beyond the language barriers,'' he \n     said. ``You combine that with the fact that parties and \n     candidates traditionally have not reached out to them. It's \n     asking a lot for someone to make a decision when they don't \n     have all that background information, and no one is reaching \n     out to them.''\n       Given the added work that is required by immigrants to seek \n     out this information, Nguyen noted that ``they are more \n     likely to give up or feel intimidated in the face of \n     additional hurdles or hoops.''\n       Within the Asian American community, those who tend to vote \n     at higher rates also tend to be more proficient in English, \n     and have higher incomes and higher education. . . . Many are \n     also homeowners as opposed to renters. Voter suppression laws \n     . . . would result in a distorted representation of the Asian \n     American population.\n       ``All of these factors matter. . . . They \n     disproportionately hurt populations that are lower income, \n     lower education, renters, younger people''. . . . ``You get a \n     skew in terms of communities of color less likely to be \n     represented. Even within those communities you will get a \n     class skew and an age skew in terms of who has a voice.'' . . \n     .\n       Ultimately, people should be pushing for more ways to make \n     voting easier and pull more people toward civic engagement . \n     . . adding that even if lawmakers are genuinely concerned \n     about voter fraud, it occurs far more infrequently than voter \n     suppression, of which there are widespread examples.\n       Previous research suggests that there is little to no voter \n     fraud and a Harvard study on double voting, one of the most \n     frequently cited examples of fraud, suggests . . . it's ``not \n     . . . carried out in such a systematic way that it presents a \n     threat to the integrity of American elections.''\n       ``This is a serious reminder of how important political and \n     civic education is for our most vulnerable communities.''\n\n  For far too long, Native communities have faced massive challenges in \nexercising their right to vote. Voter suppression efforts in Montana, \nas illustrated by this Mic article from July 6, 2021, are just one \nexample of recent efforts to disenfranchise Native voters. The article \nis entitled ``Montana is ground zero for Native American voter \nsuppression--and the fight against it.''\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting practices \nand gave Native American communities the right to vote, in theory. Most \nof us know now that even with the Voting Rights Act in place, voter \nsuppression is still going strong. In Montana, Native Americans are \nfighting new Republican laws that further restrict their ability to \nvote.\n  This year, Montana Democratic Governor Steve Bullock, who served for \n8 years, was replaced by Republican Greg Gianforte. With a Democrat no \nlonger holding veto power, State Republicans took advantage of the \nGovernor's election by passing two new voting law bills--house bill \n176, which eliminates same-day voter registration, and house bill 530, \nwhich makes it illegal for people to distribute or collect mail-in \nballots if they are being paid to do so.\n  Per the National Congress of American Indians, the turnout rate \namongst Native voters is up to 10 percentage points lower than any \nother racial group. In 2019, the Brennan Center reported that \nrestrictive voting laws throughout the country continued to \ndisproportionately impact Native communities.\n\n  On the surface, preventing people from being paid to collect ballots \nmight seem like an OK idea, but in Montana, local nonprofits like \nWestern Native Voice and Montana Native Voice pay people to collect and \ndistribute ballots as an important part of their voting strategy. \nWithout this practice, many people would be unable to cast their \nballots at all.\n  For example, the New York Times reported the story of Laura Roudine, \na resident of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, who had emergency open-\nheart surgery only a week before the 2020 election. Because of the \nrisks that coronavirus posed, neither Roudine nor her husband could \nvote in person. Home delivery wasn't an option either because it \ndoesn't exist in her area of the reservation. Instead, the Times \nreported, the couple relied on Renee LaPlant, a Blackfeet community \norganizer with Western Native Voice, who took applications and ballots \nback and forth between their home and one of the only two satellite \nelection offices located on the 2,300-square-mile reservation. The new \nlaws signed by Gianforte would make this practice illegal.\n  Native American communities in Montana are organizing against these \nvoter suppression efforts. In May, the ACLU of Montana and the Native \nAmerican Rights Fund sued on behalf of several Native voting rights \norganizations and four Montana Tribal communities, stating that the new \nlaws will disenfranchise Native voters in the State.\n  I know I am running low on time. I will not be able to speak to the \nquestion of the student vote and how Republican legislatures are doing \nall they can to keep young voters from voting because they are more \nlikely to vote Democratic or to speak on felon disenfranchisement and \nwhat that means in our democracy. I am not able to speak on these, but \nit does not mean that I do not think they are important; it just \nreminds us of the magnitude of this problem.\n  Voter suppression laws have devastating consequences for real \nAmericans every day, so I want to conclude my remarks today with the \nstory of Crystal Mason, which is told in the New York Times on April 6, \n2021, in an article entitled ``Crystal Mason Was Sentenced to Five \nYears Behind Bars Because She Voted.''\n\n       Whenever you hear Republican rants about widespread voter \n     fraud supposedly undermining Americans' faith in the \n     integrity of their elections, remember the story of Crystal \n     Mason.\n       Ms. Mason, a 46-year-old grandmother from the Fort Worth \n     area, has been in the news off and on since 2016, when Texas \n     prosecutors decided she was a vote fraudster so dangerous \n     that justice demanded she be sentenced to five years behind \n     bars.\n       Her offense? Visiting her local precinct on Election Day \n     that year and casting a provisional ballot for president. Ms. \n     Mason was not eligible to vote at the time because she was on \n     supervised release after serving a prison term for federal \n     tax fraud. Texas, like many states, bars those with criminal \n     records from voting until they have finished all terms of \n     their sentence.\n       Ms. Mason, who had only recently returned home to her three \n     children and had gone to the polls that day at the urging of \n     her mother, said she did not realize she wasn't allowed to \n     cast a ballot. When poll workers couldn't find her name on \n     the rolls, they assumed it was a clerical error and suggested \n     she fill out the provisional ballot.\n       Provisional ballots are a useful way to deal with questions \n     about a voter's eligibility that can't be resolved at the \n     polling place. Since 2002, Congress has required that states \n     offer them as part of the Help America Vote Act, a law passed \n     in the aftermath of the 2000 election debacle, when millions \n     of ballots were disqualified. Ms. Mason's ballot was rejected \n     as soon as the search of the database determined that she was \n     ineligible. In other words, the system worked the way it was \n     intended to.\n       Tarrant County prosecutors went after her for illegal \n     voting anyway. They said she\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\n     should have known she was not allowed to vote. The state had \n     sent her a letter telling her so back in 2012, shortly after \n     she had been sentenced in the tax fraud case. The letter was \n     delivered to her home even though she had already begun \n     serving her sentence behind bars. ``They sent it to the one \n     place they knew she was not going to be,'' said Alison \n     Grinter, Ms. Mason's lawyer.\n       The prosecutors also pointed out that when she cast her \n     ballot in 2016, she signed an affidavit [saying] that she had \n     completed all the terms of her sentence.\n       Ms. Mason said she had not read the fine print; she was \n     focused on writing down her address in exactly the form it \n     appeared on her driver's license. She was convicted after a \n     one-day trial and sentenced to five years behind bars for \n     casting a ballot that was never counted.\n       ``It's a surreal experience to be in a courtroom for these \n     trials,'' said Christopher Uggen, a professor of law and \n     sociology at the University of Minnesota who has studied the \n     impact of felon disenfranchisement for decades, and has \n     testified as an expert in prosecutions of people charged with \n     illegal voting.\n       ``You've got the judges, you've got the lawyers. You've got \n     somebody who often is a model probationer called in, and \n     what's at issue is whether they voted. I have overriding \n     sense of, gosh, don't we have other crimes to prosecute? It \n     really should be a consensus issue in a democracy that we \n     don't incarcerate people for voting.''\n       Mr. Uggen said that there is a stronger case for criminal \n     punishment of certain election-law offenses like campaign-\n     finance violations or sabotaging voting machines, that can do \n     more widespread damage to our election system. But in his own \n     work he has found that the people who get punished are more \n     likely to fit Ms. Mason's description: female, low-level \n     offenders who are doing relatively well in the community. \n     ``These are not typically folks who represent some great \n     threat to public safety,'' he said.\n       You wouldn't get that sense from how Ms. Mason has been \n     treated. After her voting conviction, a federal judge found \n     she had violated the terms of her supervised release, and \n     sentenced her to 10 extra months behind bars. That \n     punishment, which she began serving in December 2018, earned \n     her no credit toward her five-year state sentence.\n       Ms. Mason has continued to fight her case, but so far she \n     has lost at every step. In March 2020, a three-judge panel on \n     a state appellate court rejected her challenge to her \n     sentence. The court reasoned that she broke the law simply by \n     trying to vote while knowing she was on supervised release. \n     It didn't matter whether she knew that Texas prohibits voting \n     by people in that circumstance.\n       This appears to be a clear misapplication of Texas election \n     law, which criminalizes voting only by people who actually \n     know they are not eligible, not those who, like Ms. Mason, \n     mistakenly believe that they are. It's as though Ms. Mason \n     had asked a police officer what the local speed limit was, \n     and he responded: ``Beat's me. Why don't you start driving \n     and see if we pull you over?''\n       Last week, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's \n     highest court for criminal cases, agreed to rule on Ms. \n     Mason's appeal. It's her last chance to avoid prison for \n     voting. Tossing her conviction would bring a small measure of \n     justice to a woman whose punishment should have been limited \n     to, at most, not being able to cast a ballot.\n       But it wouldn't give her back the last four years of fear \n     and uncertainty she has endured for no good reason. Ms. \n     Mason's first grandchild was born a few months ago, another \n     reminder of how much she would miss if she were to lose the \n     appeal and end up back behind bars. ``This is very \n     overwhelming, waking up every day knowing that prison is on \n     the line, trying to maintain a smile on your face in front of \n     your kids and you don't know the outcome,'' Ms. Mason told \n     The Times in an interview. ``Your future is in someone else's \n     hands because of a simple error.''\n       Identifying errors like these is the whole point of \n     offering provisional ballots: The crazy quilt of voting rules \n     and regulations that Americans face from state to state can \n     trip up even the best-informed voters, and honest mistakes \n     are common. By prosecuting Ms. Mason, just one of more than \n     44,000 Texans whose provisional ballot in 2016 was found to \n     be ineligible, the state is saying that you attempt to \n     participate in democracy at your own risk.\n       That risk is almost always higher for people of color. \n     Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, likes to brag about the \n     155 people his office has successfully prosecuted for \n     election fraud in the last 16 years--an average of fewer than \n     10 per year. What he doesn't say out loud is what the \n     A.C.L.U. of Texas found in an analysis of the cases he has \n     prosecuted: almost three-quarters [of those cases] involved \n     Black or Latino defendants, and nearly half involved woman of \n     color, like Ms. Mason.\n       At this point you might be wondering why Ms. Mason was \n     ineligible to vote in the first place. She had been released \n     from prison, after all, and was trying to work her way back \n     into society. As more states are coming to understand, there \n     is no good argument for denying the vote to people with a \n     criminal record, and that's before you consider the \n     practice's explicitly racist roots. There is even a strong \n     case to be made for letting those in prison vote, as Maine, \n     Vermont and most Western European countries do. And yet \n     today, more than five million Americans, including Ms. Mason, \n     are unable to vote because of a criminal conviction. That has \n     a far greater impact on state and national elections than any \n     voter fraud that has ever been uncovered.\n       Given the disproportionate number of Black and brown people \n     caught up in the criminal justice system, it's not hard to \n     see a connection between cases like Ms. Mason's and the \n     broader Republican war on voting, which so often targets \n     people who look like her. The nation's tolerance of \n     prosecutions for the act of casting a ballot reveals \n     complacency about the right to vote, Mr. Uggen said, and a \n     troubling degree of comfort with voting restrictions \n     generally. ``There's a slippery slope: If you start exempting \n     individuals from the franchise, it's easy to exempt other \n     individuals by defining them outside the citizenry,'' he \n     said. ``What is shocking to me is that people view this as \n     acceptable in a political system that calls itself a \n     democracy.''\n\n  Mr. President, these efforts to subvert our democracy cannot be \nallowed to stand. Congress must pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis \nAct immediately to protect free and fair elections across this Nation. \nAnd if Senate Republicans will not join us, then we must reform the \nfilibuster. We must pass this vital legislation. Our democracy depends \non it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Madam President, voting rights are really at the heart \nof our ``We the People'' Constitution.\n  I will tell you, every time I look at a printed copy of the \nConstitution and I see those three words in supersize font, ``We the \nPeople,'' I think, you know, it is a beautiful thing that our Founders, \nwhen they were writing the Constitution, reminded us of the heart of \nwhat it is all about: not power that flows down from Kings or dictators \nbut power that flows up from the people of the United States.\n  And how does that power flow? It flows through elections. So if you \ndon't have integrity in the elections, then, you really don't have \ngovernment of, by, and for the people.\n  Now, over the course of our Nation, we know that we have worked to \nexpand the vision the Nation was founded on, but it wasn't reached in \nthe beginning. It was often the case that only White Protestant male \nlandowners got to vote in the beginning.\n  And we recognized that every person created equal needs to have an \nequal\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\npart of the franchise, and so we have, through battles over more than \n200 years, fixed those challenges. And there have been some dramatic \ndebates over this, and it hasn't been easy.\n  But I want to take us back specifically to the debate of 1890-1891. \nNow, this was during a period when, in the Southern States, more and \nmore clever strategies were being developed to prevent people from \nvoting, either through the registration process or through the polling \nprocess.\n  Now, in the registration process, there would be things like: Explain \nwhat this letter of the Constitution means or how many beans are in \nthis jar of jelly beans or other ridiculous questions, to which those \nat the registrar's office could say: We are sorry. You can't register.\n  And if you got registered, then you would have actually the \npossibility of intimidation at the polling place. There was one case \nwhere men on horseback formed a circle around the ballot box so, \nessentially, a Black American couldn't get to the ballot box, but for a \nWhite American, the horses would part and let them vote--voter \nintimidation.\n  Well, those crude barriers are part of history. They are in the \ndustbin. Great. But, unfortunately, there are many modern strategies \ndesigned to get to the same result, strategies to make it hard to \nregister to vote. Sometimes it is very prejudicial ID requirements or \nmultiple ID requirements designed to fit the profile that members of \none party are more likely to have than members of another party to bias \nthe outcome.\n  Sometimes it is taking and saying: We are going to be able to have a \nprivate contractor purge the voting rolls of people who haven't voted \nin the last few elections--knowing that it is being done specifically \nbecause the members of one party are a little worse at turning out \nevery single election than the members of the other party.\n  Now, these strategies on registration are at one stage, and then \nthere are the strategies at the polling place, all designed to \nundermine ``We the People.'' And they are mostly election-day \nstrategies.\n  What are those strategies? Well, take a--have a really large precinct \nwith a single voting location in places you don't want people to vote \nbecause so many people have to get into that precinct voting place that \nthere will be a long line or understaff it so the movement through the \npolling place is slow or put in machines that don't work really well or \nput it in a location where there is no parking, which makes it really \nhard for people to get to the polls.\n  You might think that these strategies don't still exist, but I am \nsorry to report to you they absolutely do exist.\n  A member of our caucus today, Cory Booker, was noting that, across \nAmerica, the average wait time for Black Americans is twice as long as \nthe average wait time for White Americans. But in Georgia--in Georgia--\nin the last election, the average wait time was, by numbers that I \nhave, 5 times as long or, excuse me, 10 times as long: about 5 minutes \nin a predominantly White precinct, 80 percent-plus White, and about 50 \nminutes in a predominantly Black precinct--about 10 times as long.\n  So along comes a couple strategies to really enable people to vote \nwithout that type of intimidation. One is vote-by-mail, and one is \nearly voting.\n  Now, my State of Oregon is quite proud of being the first vote-by-\nmail State. So let's talk about that for a moment. Back in the 1990s, \nthe Republican Party said: You know, we have noticed that people who \nhave requested absentee ballots have a higher turnout rate than those \nwho vote on election day.\n  It makes sense because they receive the ballot in the mail and have \nplenty of opportunity to fill it out, mail it in; whereas, on election \nday, well, life happens: You were planning to vote, but you had to go \npick up your child from daycare. You were planning to vote, but your \nboss asked you to work late. You were planning to vote, but you went by \nthe polling place, and it had been moved from the previous 2 years--\nanother trick--and you didn't know where it was. You went by the \npolling place, but you saw a long line, and you knew you didn't have 3 \nhours to stand in that line.\n  So the Republicans in my State said: You know what, we will have an \nadvantage if we get all the Republicans--or as many as we can--to ask \nfor absentee ballots. And so they did. Then the Democrats said: That is \npretty smart. We will do the same thing.\n  So the first year I was running for the State house of \nrepresentatives, 50 percent of the people in the State were voting by \nmail by getting on a list to ask for an absentee ballot.\n  So everyone said: This is such a good idea; why don't we do this for \neverybody and not make people request absentee ballots. So in the next \nelection, which was the 2020 election, essentially, it was all vote-by-\nmail. And people loved it.\n  I found out going door-to-door--I always kind of had a nostalgic \npoint in my heart for election day when we all go to the polls \ntogether. And I would go door-to-door in my first campaign in 1988, and \nI would say: What do you like or what do you not like? And people would \ngenerally say: The thing that I am really frustrated about--and it \nwould be some issue for transportation. It would be some problem, \nincluding just simply the potholes in the street.\n  And I would say: Well, that is a city issue, but I am running for the \nState legislature. But maybe the State can help get more money to the \nmunicipality. But what do you like?\n  Oh, we love voting by mail because we can sit at the kitchen table \nand talk over the issues. We are not trying to make decisions in the \nheat of the moment in a voting booth.\n  We have complicated ballot measures in my State.\n  We can read through the pros and cons. And--you know what--we can \ninvite our children to the kitchen table and discuss it with them.\n  They really loved vote-by-mail, and we went to that system. But it \nwasn't something driven by Ds or Rs. In fact, Republicans controlled \nthe house and senate of the legislature in the State of Oregon at that \ntime. They controlled both chambers.\n  Utah went to vote-by-mail. Utah is a reliably Republican State. \nAgain, it wasn't to advantage one party or the other; it was to ensure \nthat the franchise is available for every single American and that \nthere are no shenanigans on election day. And shouldn't that be what we \nare all about? Because if you really want to look at where voting is \ncompromised, where essentially votes are stolen from our citizens, it \nis the shenanigans on election day, which means vote-by-mail and early \nvoting are very important to address that.\n  So what do we see now in some 19 States across our country? In those \n19 States, there are strategies being implemented to make it harder to \nregister and easier to purge the registration lists. There are \nstrategies to make it harder to vote by mail, including saying: There \nwill be no permanent vote-by-mail list; you have to sign up every \nsingle time. There are strategies to limit and curtail early voting.\n  Every State is a little different, but those 19 States that are \npassing laws, those laws are targeted with strategies specifically \nfocused on things that they think will hurt the turnout of Democrats \nrather than Republicans, and it is just wrong. We need to be blind to \nparty divisions when we are protecting the ballot box for all \nAmericans. We need to be blind to race.\n  Now, folks say: Surely, there is still not a racial component in this \neffort to keep people from voting. And I would like to affirm that that \nis the case, but these strategies often target predominantly precincts \nthat are high minority populations: Hispanic or Black precincts.\n\n  And other strategies target the young and college students. Why? \nBecause they tend to vote a little bit more to the Democratic side of \nthe ballot.\n  And some of these are targeted specifically at Native American \nreservations to make it so those on reservations have to drive an hour \nto 2 hours to drop off their ballot, and they won't vote in the same \nnumbers as if you have a voting location on the reservation or they can \nvote by mail.\n  So we have struggled. Going back to the debate of 1890, down the hall \nin the House of Representatives, the conversation was initiated by \nHenry Cabot Lodge, and Lodge put forward a voting rights bill that \nsaid: You know what, things are going wrong in America, and we need to \nprotect the right to register, the right to vote, and the right to\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nhave those ballots fairly counted. So he basically said that \njurisdictions could appeal to the district courts to get Federal \nsupervision on the three critical stages of registering citizens, of \nconducting the election, and of counting the ballots afterward--those \nthree phases. And it passed in the House of Representatives.\n  And at that time, it was the Republican Party that backed this \nfundamental right for all Americans. You know how many Democrats voted \nfor Henry Cabot Lodge's bill? Zero. Zero. Every vote for it came from \nthe Republican Party. That was the Republican Party in 1890.\n  In 1891, the bill was here in the Senate. Well, what happened in the \nSenate? Well, a group of Senators said: We don't want the Senate to \never vote on this bill. So they spoke at length, refused to give \nunanimous consent to get to a final vote.\n  Now, why do we call that a filibuster? So, at our founding, the whole \nvision that our Founders laid out was that you hear everyone speak, and \nthen you vote and you take the path the majority favors over the \nminority.\n  Now, they really emphasized--this is important--that you shouldn't \nhave a supermajority because they wrote the Constitution while they \nwere under the Confederation Congress. The Confederation Congress had a \nsupermajority. And because of that supermajority, they couldn't get \nanything done. They couldn't raise the money to take on Shays' \nRebellion. The Senate was paralyzed over policymaking.\n  So the Founders said: Whatever you do, do not have a supermajority \nbecause it paralyzes the body, and the body ends up taking the path the \nminority prefers, who are obstructing a final vote, rather than the \nmajority.\n  Let's just look at some of the comments that our Founders made. James \nMadison:\n\n       In cases where justice or the general good might require \n     new laws . . . or [new] measures . . . the . . . principle of \n     free government would be reversed.\n\n  He is speaking to a supermajority because it would no longer be the \nmajority that would decide; it would be transferred to the minority. \nAnd he went on to say the damage that would be done if that happened: \nThe basic principle of free government would be assaulted if the \nminority makes the decision instead of the majority.\n  What possible logic could there be to say the path that most people \nthink is the wrong path is the path we will take? That is what happens \nwhen the supermajority blocks a final simple majority vote.\n  And we have Hamilton. Of course, Hamilton gets a lot of attention \nwith the play done on Hamilton and his general supersized role in the \nearly stage of our Republic.\n  Again, Hamilton was very aware of how the Confederation Congress was \npolarized before we got our Constitution in 1787. He, again, refers to \nthe supermajority: It would be, in practice, as if you need everybody; \nand the history of any establishment that takes this principle is the \nresult of impotence, perplexity, and disorder. He is referring to the \nsupermajority requirement of the Confederation Congress.\n  What else did he say? Well, Hamilton said--and he uses some language \nwe don't really use today: ``If a pertinacious minority can control the \nmajority . . . tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; \ncontemptible compromises of the public good.''\n  I sometimes think that sounds like a description of the Senate \ntoday--tedious delays, intrigue, contemptible compromises of the public \ngood. The public good is compromised when the Senate is not able to \ndebate issues that face the United States of America.\n  He went on to say: ``The supermajority's real operation is to \nembarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the \ngovernment.''\n  ``Destroy the energy of the government''? Doesn't that ring somewhat \ntrue of what we have gone through in trying to get to a vote on Build \nBack Better over this last year, any components of it, and trying to \nget a vote to protect our fundamental right and freedom to vote? And it \nhas gone on all year. We are a year into the administration now.\n  So in modern times, we now are facing, again, what was faced in 1890. \nAnd I didn't really tell you the outcome of that 1890 debate. The House \npassed it. All Republicans came over here, and a number of Senators \nsaid: We are not going to give consent to get to a final vote.\n  They broke the contract--the social contract that you listen to \neverybody, and then, having heard all the ideas, having had a debate \nthat maybe stretched many, many days or maybe weeks, you vote.\n  So the newspapers started to call this tactic, way back in the mid-\n1800s--they called this tactic--``piracy,'' because the core principle \nwas being violated by people taking over the Senate--pirates taking \nover the Senate. And the common term for pirates, ``freebooters''--\nfreebooters, that is where ``filibuster'' comes from. It is a \ncorruption of the term ``freebooter.''\n  The pirates are taking over. They are breaking the deal of America. \nThey are breaking the design of the Senate. It is supposed to be that \nafter you listen to everyone--everyone has made their points--you vote \nby simple majority.\n  Now, we have had a particular development over the last three decades \nin which the Senate has become more and more dysfunctional. I had the \nchance to see this evolve because I first came here as an intern in \n1976. And up in the staff Gallery, I would go up and watch each \namendment being debated.\n  And there was no television. So Senators couldn't see what was going \non. Staff back in the offices couldn't see what was going on. There was \nno cell phone. There was no fax machine. And so each Senator had a \nstaff member watching the debate. And then when the vote came, you \nwould rush down to those elevators that are outside that door. And when \nthe Senators came up from the subway train that comes over from the \noffice buildings, you would meet your Senator, and you would describe \nthe debate that had happened. And if it was your particular topic area, \nyou would describe what people back home were saying or what you had \nunderstood was the key question. And then the Senator would come in and \nvote.\n  And then, when the vote was tallied, there would be 6 or 12 Senators, \ngenerally clustered here, and they would all say ``Mr. President,'' \nbecause whomever got called on first got the next amendment. There was \nno set of amendments lined up on the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which is \nwhat I was staffing for Senator Hatfield.\n  I was very intrigued by the functioning of our government. So I went \nback to college and then dropped out 3 months later to come back here \nfor the start of the Carter administration to watch what was going on \nin our government with a new Presidency. I waited tables. I volunteered \nfor nonprofits. I went door to door for the Virginia Consumer Congress, \nworking on issues related to renewable energy or energy efficiency. But \nI watched the Senate, and what I saw was a Senate that could debate \nissues in that year of 1977.\n  Then I came back here after graduate school, and I was planning to go \noverseas to work on issues of economic development in very poor \ncountries--fundamental issues of healthcare, fundamental issues of \neducation. But I was offered an opportunity to work on something here \nin DC as a Presidential fellow, to work on the issue of ``How do you \ndecrease the threat of blowing up the world with nuclear weapons?''\n  So I went to work for the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, \nunder President Reagan. Then I went to work for the Congressional \nBudget Office, after 2 years of working for President Reagan and Caspar \nWeinberger. The Congressional Budget Office works for Congress, and I \ndid studies and did briefings here on the Hill, watching the Senate. \nAnd the Senate started to have troubles, but it was still pretty \nfunctional.\n  Nothing prepared me for arriving here as a U.S. Senator in 2009, \nJanuary, and seeing the utter decay and dysfunction of my beloved \nSenate--your beloved Senate, the Senate once called the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world.\n  So I started to have conversations with colleagues about what had \nhappened, and I saw that we had cloture motions--that is a motion to \nclose debate--one after the other after the other and very few \namendments.\n  Now, on the amendment side, this is a chart that shows the decline in \namendments from the 109th Congress to the 116th. The 116th Congress is \nthe\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\none that just ended. There is a tenfold reduction in the number of \namendments over those 14 years--a tenfold reduction in amendments, a \nsteady line downwards.\n  Well, that is one symptom of the problem, but then there was another \npiece of this problem, which was more and more motions to close debate. \nAnd those motions are designed to be rare. So they take--after you make \nthe motion--a day plus. You have to have an intervening day, and then \nthe second day after you make the motion, you can hold a vote on \nclosing debate, because it is supposed to be such a rare moment, once \nor twice a year.\n  Then, if you succeed in getting the votes to close debate, it is 30 \nhours of debate. Well, that takes 2 or 3 days to get 30 hours of debate \nin and then an extra hour for any Senator who didn't have the chance to \nspeak. So there is that factor. And then, finally, you can get to the \nfinal vote.\n  Those cloture motions eat up entire weeks. So you come in, and, on \nMonday, you file a motion to close debate. On Wednesday, you vote on \nactually closing debate because you have to have that intervening day \nof Tuesday. Then you have 30 hours, which takes the time up of the \nnormal day of Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe on Friday you get to \nvote.\n  That is what I am saying: Every cloture motion takes up a week. Well, \nthe Senate is normally only here 30 to 40 weeks a year. So if you have \n30 or 40 cloture motions, you have essentially taken up all the \nSenate's time. But the Senate has an incredibly complex, extensive \nagenda. It needs to address so many issues in healthcare and housing \nand education, good-paying jobs, the environment. How do you take on \nclimate? How do you take on international trade? How do you take on \nhuman rights in foreign countries like China, which are conducting \ngenocide? So many issues around the world, plus it has so many \nnominations that have to be addressed.\n  I am told--I haven't double-checked this yet--that there were four \nCabinet positions that required confirmation in the first Congress--\nfour. Then you had Ambassadors, and you had judges. But you had a \npretty small number of nominations in those positions. Now, we have \nwell over a thousand positions--well over a thousand--and we have a \nnomination process in which people are nominated to have a higher rank \nin the military or advancement to certain ranks in the civil service. \nAnd so you have extensive lists that need to go through as well.\n  So let's take a look at what happened with the growth of cloture \nmotions. This is the history going back to 1910. We actually only had \ncloture starting in 1917. And, in 1917, you see that there were very \nfew cloture motions in a decade--3 in a decade, 10 in a decade, 5 in a \ndecade, 8 in a decade, 3 in a decade--less than 1 per year.\n\n  Well, that intervening day kind of made sense because they were less \nthan one time per year. It was supposed to be a rare moment in which \nyou would address the fact that some Senators were not going to let the \nSenate proceed as our Founders envisioned, which was, after hearing \neverybody, to conduct a vote.\n  Then you start to see in the 1970s a big change. I think we have a \nchart that shows it year by year. We don't. Well, this will give you \nsome sense of it. So we have--divided by 10, since these are by \ndecade--we had growth in the 1980s to more than 20 per year; a growth \nin the 1990s to more than--well, an average of 35 to 36 a year. In the \n2000s, an average of 45 per year. In the 2010 decade, an average of \nover 100 per year, taking up an entire week of the Senate's time.\n  So how did this unfold? Well, let's think a little bit about the fact \nthat that filibuster that occurred in 1891 was about blocking Black \nAmericans from having power--the power to vote--because if you have the \npower to vote, you have the power to weigh in. That means you have a \nlot of power in our society. So there was a deep determination to keep \nBlack Americans from voting.\n  That was the filibuster of 1891. And its failure in the Senate--\nremember, it passed by a majority in the House, and it had majority \nsupport in the Senate, but the filibuster was used to crush this.\n  Now, that process meant that, from 1891 through 1965, when we passed \nvoting rights in this Chamber, the filibuster was used for one thing: \ncrushing the political rights of Black Americans.\n  Now, someone will say: Well, that is not quite right. There was an \nepisode in 1917 in which the issue wasn't civil rights or voting \nrights. The issue was whether to arm our commercial ships against \npotential attacks by the Germans.\n  And that is partly true.\n  In March of that year, 1917, we weren't yet in the war, World War I. \nAnd there was a group of Senators who said: If we arm these ships and \nthey deployed depth charges against German submarines or so forth, we \nare going to be in the war, and we will not have had a declaration of \nwar. We will be pulled into the war by essentially this process of \narming ships.\n  So they spoke at length during the last week of Congress, and time \nran out, and the bill died. And the next week, the new Congress \nstarted. This is back when the transition happened in March. And the \nnew Congress immediately said: We can close debate with 67 votes or \ntwo-thirds of the Senate. Actually, it was two-thirds; we didn't have \n100 Senators here--two-thirds of the Senate, showing up to vote and \nclose debate. So that was the first time that we had a motion to close \ndebate since 1805.\n  And the reason I say it is since 1805, is that our original rules had \na motion called the previous question. And on the previous question, \nthere is a little bit of uncertainty of exactly how it was used. It \nsometimes said that, basically, you got to speed things up so we can \nget to the final vote. Other times, it has been interpreted as ``No, \nthe previous question means we vote; we vote on the question before \nus.'' But it was never actually used, and it wasn't used because there \nwas a social contract.\n  The Senate said: We can listen to everybody, and, then, having heard \neverybody, we can vote.\n  Fair enough. Fair deal. Square deal.\n  So in 1805, when Aaron Burr was in charge of rewriting the rule book, \nhe said: We don't use this rule. We don't need this rule. We have a \nsocial contract. We listen to everybody and then have a simple majority \nvote, as our Founders designed the Senate. No need.\n  So we hadn't had a rule that essentially enabled this body to come to \na vote in that period from 1805 through 1917. So it is true that the \nbill was delayed for 1 week. But the new Congress immediately came in, \ncreated a new rule to close debate, closed debate on that bill, and \npassed a bill to arm ships. So the only real thing that was crushed in \nthose years from 1891 through 1965 was voting rights for Black \nAmericans because the idea that you would prevent a simple majority \nvote, as our Founders intended, was piracy.\n\n  Well, in 1965, we passed voting rights, and the national consensus \nwas we are putting that behind us; we are putting the discrimination \nbehind us; we are putting the manipulation on election day behind us. \nWe are going to have a fair opportunity for everybody to vote in this \ncountry. So the filibuster lost some of its taint because it was no \nlonger primarily an instrument to crush the political rights of Black \nAmericans.\n  People started saying: You know, maybe I can use this on something \nother than civil rights or something other than voting rights.\n  By the way, it had been used almost entirely on final passage of \nbills.\n  Maybe I can use it on nominations, to prevent nominations from going \nthrough expeditiously. Maybe I can use it on amendments. Maybe I can \nuse it on motions to proceed.\n  Let's take a look at the issue of amendments. Prior to the sixties, \none time, there had been a cloture motion on an amendment.\n  You know that vision that I saw in 1976 where one amendment was \ndebated, and then when it was done, there were no pending amendments, \nso the next person would say: ``Wait''--they would always say ``Mr. \nPresident'' because there was always a man in the Chair at that point; \nI am now glad to say ``Madam President''--``Madam President,'' and \nwhoever got heard first would put up the next amendment.\n  Well, that world started to change along the way. People started to \nobstruct not just final passage but obstruct amendments. There has been\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nsteady growth in that over time. We are now up, in the last decade, to \nabout 14 times per year or 143 times in the decade.\n  Then we have the question of the motion to proceed. You would think--\nwe have a legislative calendar, and that calendar has a list of bills \neligible to consider. Someone says: I want to make a motion--normally \nthe majority leader--to go to a particular item, a particular bill on \nthat calendar. You would think that it would be like ``Hey, we are \ngoing to go to the election bill. Do I have majority support to do \nthat?'' You would have a 15-minute debate and vote. You decide to go to \nthat bill or not.\n  Why would you take up a lot of the Senate's precious time debating \nwhether to debate a bill? But that logic has not prevailed, so we have \na continuous increase in the attack on the ability to get a bill to the \nfloor. Well, in the sixties, about one per year; in the seventies, \nabout one per year; four times per year in the eighties; more than 10 \nin the nineties--it escalates.\n  Here is the thing: To get a bill to the floor, if a group is intent \non forcing a cloture motion, you have to have a motion, an intervening \nday, 30 hours of debate, and then you have to be able to have an \nadditional hour for any Senator who wasn't able to speak in those 30 \nhours. In other words, it takes an entire week to decide whether to \nactually debate a bill. That is absolutely insane.\n  If you want the U.S. Senate to be unable to address issues, then \nallow unlimited debate until there is a cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed. I think most Senators agree that that should go. But here is \nthe problem: Whichever party is in the minority doesn't want to make \nthings easier for the majority. And this really goes to a core \nchallenge of our highly tribal parties.\n  In the Senate that I first saw, the philosophies of the two parties--\nif you were doing a bell curve of each party, they overlapped. They \noverlapped a lot. There were Republicans who voted more like Democrats \nand Democrats who voted more like Republicans. There was a lot more, \ntherefore, bipartisan work. Now, if you do those same two bell curves \non how people vote, there is a chasm. If you do a bell curve where the \nDemocrats are and a bell curve where the Republicans are, there is a \ndeep valley, a chasm in the middle.\n  We have become more intensely tribal in ways that are absolutely \nreinforced by social media, all those commentaries on various \nInstagrams or a tweet reinforcing the idea that the other side is evil, \nthat the two sides are far apart, which leads the minority in this \nChamber to say: Since the other side is evil, we will just prevent them \nfrom ever getting to a bill. If 41 of us--and right now, there are 50 \ndesks on this side of the aisle, and there are 50 desks on that side of \nthe aisle--if 41 of us proceed to say we will not vote to close debate \non a motion to proceed, you can never get to a bill.\n  We have had that happen multiple times this year in which my \nRepublican colleagues voted to prevent us from debating voting rights, \nthe protection of voting rights. What a change from 1890, when, in the \nHouse of Representatives, every vote cast for the bill to defend the \nright to vote in America was a Republican vote. Now, every vote against \ndebating the issue has come from the Republicans. What a swap over the \ntime period.\n\n  This, essentially, is a strategy to kill bills in the cradle before \nthey are debated on this floor.\n  Both caucuses, by the way, have done this. When I speak of voting \nrights, it is now my colleagues across the aisle who are deliberately \nblocking it from being debated time and again, but on other issues and \nwhen the Democrats have been in the minority, we have done the same \nthing. It needs to end.\n  You know, I had conversations with a whole group of Republicans last \nyear saying: Next year, we have no idea who will be in the majority. We \nhave no idea. So let's just have 1 hour at most, evenly divided, to \ndiscuss whether a bill comes to the floor, and then we will vote. \nInstead of an intervening day and 30 hours, plus extra hours if you \ndidn't get to debate, you have 1 hour evenly divided. If one side \nyields back its time, that means in 30 minutes, we can then decide to \nget on the bill or not.\n  Thirty hours, an intervening day, or 30 minutes. That makes a lot \nmore sense. We have to end this.\n  I have had this conversation with nine of my colleagues across the \naisle and said: Let's do this. Let's fix the motion to proceed and \nguarantee germane amendments on the floor.\n  They were interested. Some said they would go and take it to their \npolicy team, some said they would take it to their caucus, and some \nsaid they would take it to their leadership. Then they all said \n``Sorry'' because their leadership said ``No way are we going to have \nkind of the ordinary Senators who aren't in leadership have a movement \nto fix the Senate.''\n  Mitch McConnell told them: No. We will make changes depending on what \nis best for our caucus. And if we are in the majority, that is \ndifferent than if we are in the minority.\n  So those efforts failed, and people keep saying to me: Hey, wouldn't \nit work if you draw up rules and implement them with the next Congress?\n  Well, we have tried that. My colleague Tom Udall, who is now our \nAmbassador to New Zealand, was there, coming in with my class in 2009. \nHe had followed this as well. So we teamed up, and we worked on these \nconversations, but ultimately we couldn't make it happen.\n  We need to fix the Senate. We need to guarantee germane amendments. \nWhen I say ``germane amendments,'' I mean amendments that are on the \ntopic.\n  When I was staffing that tax bill for Senator Hatfield, every \namendment was on taxes. Should we proceed to increase or rein in the \ntax credit that goes--or the tax deduction that goes to deducting the \ncost of your home office if you are a teacher in our public schools? It \nwas one I heard in a lot of letters. There were a ton of letters from \nteachers in Oregon about that.\n  I remember that another amendment was on employee stock ownership \nplans, which enable you to be able to enable your workers to own a \nshare of the company. How do we make those ESOPs work better? and so on \nand so forth, one tax issue after another--nothing to do with highly \npolarizing social issues on a tax bill because people knew that when \nanother bill came on healthcare, they could put healthcare issues on \nthat. When one came on transportation, they could put their \ntransportation amendments on it.\n  Now the assumption is, hey, if there is a bill that is going to pass, \nwe better throw in every idea we ever had because that is like the only \nbill that will get through the Senate. The result is these massively \nthick bills, which are an insult to democracy because in a 1,000- or a \n2,000-page bill, you are talking about thousands of ideas, of new laws, \nof new ideas being embedded.\n  There is no way the citizens can hold us accountable when we are \nvoting on a bill that is yea thick. There are a bunch of things that \nare good. There are a bunch of things that are bad. Plus, we can't even \nfigure out what some of them are before we have to vote because when \nthe deal is struck off the floor because we can't do amendments and \nbecause there is no debate, well, we are stuck with a big bill being \ndelivered and described to us. That is not the way it should work. That \nis not good for us. That is not good for the citizens.\n  Let's note that what is happening in those 19 States puts us at an \nabsolutely critical moment. You can think of democracy as a flickering \nflame or a flame that has to be maintained and nurtured from one \ngeneration to the next. Now, it is our challenge--our challenge--\nbecause laws are being passed on registration, laws are being passed on \nthe process of voting, and laws are being passed on the process of \ncounting that are designed to manipulate the outcome, to basically \ncheat Americans out of a fair election and, in many cases, cheat them \nout of the opportunity to vote at all or if they can vote, not have \ntheir vote fairly counted. So it is our responsibility to act.\n\n  I see my colleague from Massachusetts has come to the floor. I think \nshe is ready to speak.\n  I just want to sum up with this notion: The failure of this Senate to \nact in 1891 led to three generations in which civil rights for Black \nAmericans were suppressed in our country. If we fail to act--if we fail \nto act this year, 2022, and allow the authentic integrity of \nelections--then we may see three generations in which we lose \ngovernment of, by, and for the people.\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\n  You see, voting rights are the critical component because if those \nwho are elected break the laws or go off track, you throw them out \nthrough fair elections, but if they go off track and there are no fair \nelections, they increase their power.\n  You have to have fair elections to maintain government of, by, and \nfor the people. That is the reason we must act this week to pass the \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act that are \nbefore this Senate right now.\n  I yield to my colleague from the great State of Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I want to say a very special thank-you \nto my colleague, the Senator from Oregon. Senator Merkley has worked \nharder and more persistently on questions about the filibuster and the \nprocedures of the U.S. Senate for years now and tried to lead us to a \nmore functional situation than we are in right now. I want to thank him \nfor his leadership.\n  I know that tonight must be frustrating for him because he has tried \nso hard to get us to a better place. But I very much appreciate all \nthat he has done, and to the extent we make progress, we make progress \nin no small part because of his leadership.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I wish to honor a dedicated and creative \norganization serving communities throughout Oregon and the Nation, \ncelebrating 20 years of allowing senior citizens to stay in their homes \nwhile providing access to affordable care and community. The Village \nMovement is founded on the principle of neighborliness and provides \ncomfort, care, and affordability while maintaining dignity.\n  This wonderful movement started in 2002 with a group of community-\ndedicated friends who did not want to leave their community in \nretirement. Intent upon staying, the friends launched the Beacon Hill \nVillage in Massachusetts to provide residents who were 50 and older \npractical support and confidence to stay in their homes and live their \nlives independently.\n  This idea soon caught on, with similar villages springing up all over \nthe country, including in Oregon. There are now 14 villages throughout \nOregon bringing services to senior citizens in the comfort of their own \nhomes. The Movement supports what is often called ``aging in place'' by \ndeveloping a nurturing network of volunteers and access to services and \nsocial opportunities that are both sustainable and community-based.\n  Every village is member-driven and self-governing, allowing them to \nrespond to the needs of each community. The Movement has also expanded \nto include adults of all ages living with disabilities, preserving the \nhumanity and dignity that is so important in every stage of life.\n  I have long viewed aging in place as a bedrock principle for \nimproving quality of life for seniors and those with disabilities. \nYears ago, I started the Independence at Home Program, which helped \nprimary care providers visit frail seniors in their homes. This helped \nthem avoid unnecessary and potentially dangerous travel and remain in \ntheir homes longer than they would have otherwise.\n  I have also been proud to lead legislation as a part of the Build \nBack Better agenda that would put home care on a more even playing \nfield with institutional care. These important efforts can build on one \nanother, alongside organizations like the Village Movement, to create a \nrich tapestry of health and social supports for Americans as they age.\n  Without a doubt, the Village Movement has set a fine example of how \ncommunities can help support their neighbors. It is an honor to \nrecognize the Village Movement for its service to the United States--\nand Oregon in particular.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch, \nRepresentative  Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher, I \ncongratulate Andy Brunelle on his remarkable career in government \nservice. Andy is retiring on January 31, 2022, after 27 years with the \nU.S. Forest Service.\n  For more than 20 years, Andy has worked with our offices in his \nposition as the Capitol City Coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service. \nIn this position, he has represented both the U.S. Forest Service \nRegion 1 and Region 4 and the seven National Forests in Idaho as he has \nserved as a liaison working with State and local government officials, \nAgency directors, Idaho's congressional delegation, and interest groups \nin Idaho on issues of statewide concern. Given the importance of the \nnatural resources and species habitat on the more than 20 million acres \nof Federal forested land in Idaho he has acted on behalf of, Andy has \nworked on many challenging issues over the years. This includes working \nclosely with our delegation concerning improving and extending the \nSecure Rural Schools Program, a vital resource for Idahoans. We thank \nhim for his thoughtful, helpful, and pragmatic work for the betterment \nof our great State and country.\n  Andy began working for the U.S. Forest Service in 1995 after serving \nas special assistant for natural resources in the Office of Idaho \nGovernor Cecil D. Andrus. From 1988 to 1995, he was the Governor's key \nstaff person on a wide variety of natural resource issues, including \nchallenging issues such as water quality, Federal lands management, and \nprotection of Snake River salmon. Additionally, he served on the \nNorthwest Power Planning Council, Boise City Planning and Zoning \nCommission, and City of Boise advisory committees. Andy also dedicates \nconsiderable time to serving on boards of nonprofit organizations, \nincluding the Boise WaterShed Exhibits Environmental Education Center, \nIdaho Environmental Forum, Ted Trueblood Chapter of Trout Unlimited, \nand Harris Ranch Wildlife Mitigation Association.\n  As we wish Andy well in his well-earned retirement, we express our \ndeep gratitude for dedicating so much of his time and talents to \nenhancing, sustaining, and conserving such an essential part of our \nState's treasures. Thank you, Andy, for your decades of dedicated work \nand skilled problem-solving on behalf of Idahoans, and congratulations \non your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"},

Mr. President, I congratulate Lindsay Nothern, a cherished \nmember of my staff who is retiring from Senate service.\n  In Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous poem about how to measure success, he \nconcludes, ``to know that even one life has breathed easier because you \nhave lived. This is to have succeeded.'' I am among the many who have \nbreathed easier because of Lindsay. He has represented me, spoken for \nme, written for me, and provided outstanding counsel. He has aptly \ncommunicated the needs of Idahoans and kept Idahoans informed about the \nhappenings in Congress. For example, this includes him taking a direct \ninterest and involvement in advocating for Idaho domestic violence \nvictims and Idahoans affected by Cold War era above-ground nuclear \ntesting, often referred to as ``downwinders.'' He has taken on each \nchallenge with great compassion and persistent optimism.\n  Prior to joining my staff, Lindsay was a journalist and worked in \nnews management. He also served as press secretary for former Idaho \nGovernor Phil Batt and campaign press secretary for Representative  \nMike Simpson. Lindsay has been with me since I began my Senate service \nin 1999. I am so grateful my then communications director insisted on \nwaiting until Lindsay was available to bring onto the staff. Lindsay \nhas been with me ever since, moving from press secretary to \ncommunications director in 2011. Throughout, Lindsay has been patient, \nkind, empathetic, a great listener, and a trusted adviser.\n  Thank you, Lindsay, for your service to this extraordinary branch of \nour government, and, most importantly, your service on behalf of the \ngreat people of Idaho. I understand you have said you have had two of \nyour three wish-list jobs--bartender, radio disc\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\njockey, and cabdriver--and you still have one job on your list left to \ndo. Thank you for diverging from that list to be such a valuable part \nof my staff for all these years. I hope that in your retirement, you \nmay reach all your dreams and more. You have certainly earned it. Thank \nyou for your outstanding help and guidance, and congratulations on a \nvery successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n</pre></body>\n</html>"}
